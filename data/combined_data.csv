"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,2319,175,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular Check-In Post, with important reminders about the No Private Contact and No Activism rules","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  

It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*

*****

**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read /r/depression/wiki/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources.",SQLwitch,312,1136,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/m246c4/regular_checkin_post_with_important_reminders/

I’m always amazed at how much energy healthy people have.,"When I wake up after 8 hours of decent sleep I’m still exhausted. All day, everyday. Not just “tired”. Exhausted.

“Exercise helps!” yeah I’m sure it does but I can’t even get out of bed.

“Drink water and eat healthy!” again, I can’t even get out of bed. 

I’m guessing the next thing would be “you just have to use self discipline and force yourself to do it!” but...how? It feels as though I physically can’t.

I am currently experiencing the worst my depression has ever been. It’s really difficult to say the least.

I’m genuinely surprised I’m still here. It sounds wrong but I do feel kinda badass that I’ve managed to hold on so far...and so should you.

30 and never lived a day in my life,"I guess i have always been depressed but never really thought much of it. I'm now 30 and I'm all of a sudden cognizant of all my failures. 

Looking back I have never really lived a day in my life. Never had any friends due to severe social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum, never formally diagnosed. Never been in any relationships, hell, haven't had any sort of intimate contact with the opposite sex. Never travelled, never had any sort of a social life; spent all of my time holed up in my room and never made any efforts to improve myself. Skipped school a lot in my teens and had to be held back an extra year but by some miracle was able to go onto university which i somehow graduated from. Fat good that did me other than getting me into massive debt since i barely make above minimum wage at my job which took me over a year to land. I can't even drive at this age and still live with my elderly parents who i depend on for everything. I haven't left my room for over a year now since my job is fully WFH due to COVID. Don't have any reason to leave the house anyways since i have no one. I see no purpose in life other than repaying my parents for everything they did for me but I screwed up even that. I was retarded enough to stake their retirement savings and lose more than half of it last year. 

I want to try to get better but I just don't have the energy or motivation to even try. What is even the point when at 30 I have 0 life experiences.",ApprehensiveYou2385,36,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6ye5n/30_and_never_lived_a_day_in_my_life/

Anxiety of the future is taking over my life and I’m depressed because of it.,"In two days, it’s my birthday. As I’m writing this, I’m sobbing. For the past two days, I’ve cried hard. I can’t go a week without freaking out about the future. I feel sick and numb half the time. I don’t remember the last time I was able to just breathe.

What sucks is I’m not really worrying about myself. It’s my older brother. He struggles in school a lot and I’m just so terrified of the future. My mind is constantly filled with “is he going to be okay” “is he going to go to college” “will he become homeless and poor” and it’s driving me insane. This has been going on for so long that I don’t remember what it’s like to not feel this way. I’ve lashed out on my family due to the stress of it all. I’ve feel like I’m becoming a menace to my own family. I know how I’m feeling now is stressing my mom and dad out too. And no matter what they say, I don’t get any better. I just cry and I hate it.

I feel like there’s no way to help me. I’m just broken. Honest to God, I’ve tried so so hard to feel myself. But it’s all temporary distractions. Doomed to feel this way until I see with my own eyes my older brother become a functioning adult. And I feel like it’s slowly eating away at me. I just want to stop feeling horrible. I want everything to just be okay.",yeehawyeetus,17,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n72bwo/anxiety_of_the_future_is_taking_over_my_life_and/
Our 4 legged friends have to look over their shoulders fearing us. Is this overthinking?,"Idk if it happens everywhere, but where I live stray cats and dogs often go to various houses looking for food or shelter. It's bad enough that they have to wander around in first place, but even when kind people give them food and water, they look over their shoulders ***every 2 fucking seconds*** and jump away at slightest sound. They're hungry and thirsty for God knows how long but they're ready to give up food from fright of what might happen to them if they stay.

And this shit doesn't make anyone blink a eye when in fact it is absolutely ***heartbreaking***. If you tell this to someone, you hear ""They're animals, they're just like that"" or ""Why do you care?"" or ""Why are you overthinking?""

How is talking about real problems overthinking? Half of the time, people like them have made me feel bad for opening my mouth even when I was talking real stuff. The award for making me start questioning basic ***decency and humanity*** goes to them. 👏",AWiseDetective,12,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n7218c/our_4_legged_friends_have_to_look_over_their/
"I’m so so so low and I know why, but I don’t want to make other people feel like I’m blaming them for my depression. I’m just tired of negativity.","Husband doesn’t understand why I can’t just get out of bed and gets mad about it. Now I’m at a point where I just lay there in the morning while he complains about me not getting up. He actually took the sheets off this morning (trying to wake me up) and I just ended up crying. Which annoyed him more. So he left and now I’m crying in the shower so I don’t make him feel worse. 

Things like this happen with pretty much everyone, except my son, but I’m so afraid of him ending up being hurt my my depression. I’m so tired physically and mentally and I don’t know what to do. 

Also I’m autistic and I don’t like encouragement. But all I get is the OPPOSITE (discouragement) it seems. And that’s not great either. I’d love indifference, but nobody is capable of that it seems.

The feeling of empty ness.,"I can’t, I feel so worthless every single day of my life, but I’m to scared to die. I may only be in the later years of high school and not know much about the ‘real’ world but I feel like my life is not going to get any better. I used to use games and manga/anime to help me but now they are just unrealistic scenarios that just make me feel even worse about myself. While I don’t want do die, I don’t want do go on. I haven’t called a life line as I haven’t felt this way for very long and frankly I don’t want to. Sure they are professional but for some reason I don’t want to. Maybe because I feel like I’m going to waste their time they could use on other? Hell if I know. I don’t even know why I’m writing this, maybe to see if other go through the same thing?

Life is not for me,"For a while now (at least 5 years) i’ve felt that I never truly belonged anywhere, never fit in. I’ve come to the conclusion that life isn’t for me. I’m too sensitive, too anxious, too caught up in everything to even lead a “normal” life (whatever that is.) Point is, I’m just not cut out for it. I’m certain of that. Even the smallest things overwhelm me; ordering food at a restaurant, walking my dog around the neighborhood, literally just having a conversation with someone. I stay up till 5/6/7 in the morning every night, putting off sleep because I dread the next day. I dread having to pull the covers off my body and enter reality. It’s all too much. I get attached to people easily as well, way too easy. Once someone is in my life, I never want them to leave, no matter how toxic they may be. I will always see the good in them. When they leave (they always do) god does it fucking crush my soul. It destroys me. It doesn’t get easier the next time, and there’s always a next time. There is always pain. I’m always getting hurt. I’m just so tired. I’m only 21 and I don’t even do anything with my life, but i’m fucking drained. Every day is the same exact routine. I’m either glued to my phone or laptop and I just waste time until it’s time to sleep. This is no way to live and I know that. I feel so stuck and I don’t think i’ll ever not feel this way. No matter how hard I try to change things, after a while I end up right in this exact spot. So yeah, i’ve accepted that life wasn’t meant for me. In the meantime, i’m just trying to get to the next day.",Accomplished-Truth14,39,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6udjd/life_is_not_for_me/
Do you sometimes feel like you're too stupid for this world?,"I feel like I have nothing to offer to society. I'm a slow learner and even simple tasks are ridiculously hard for me and drain all of my energy: especially talking and being with people.

There is so much stuff that I need to do but I don't know how I will ever accomplish them. I went to university but I know nothing and I'm still not done after all these years. Dropped out to work because I was/am depressed and had no motivation for studying and now I'm stuck at this job that I don't know how to get out of. Now it seems like my education was all for nothing.

I don't even have a driver's license, was planning to get one this summer, but who am I kidding, it's approaching and it's not going to happen.

I literally suck at everything: I played games for years; still bad. I worked out for two years, never got stronger except for in the beginning. I was in sports but always got in last place in our club. I still at 24 years of age can't look people in the eyes and I giggle like some stupid school girl. In fact I don't look very masculine, I can't get a beard, already balding and skinny af.

I feel like my failure of a life would at least be bearable if I just had some friends or a partner but I've always felt like an outsider everywhere and could never make many friends. Now that I'm not in school anymore I don't know how to make friends. I work all day and for what?

I'm getting older and I feel like I'm missing out on so much and that people are gonna judge me because of my lack of experience in relationships, hobbies, cooking or whatever. I know nothing.

I actually went on a date with a girl recently though (don't worry, just for a walk). I really liked her and we are gonna see each other again but I'm still not very thrilled because I know that in the end she will see me for who I am and lose interest: a poor lazy slob with no friends who has never been in a relationship before and lives in a shitty apartment.

It's all a facade like the rest of my life. I told myself at 20 that I would kill myself at 30 if I was still as lonely and miserable and I'm almost halfway there.",skinnflojten,226,25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6k4kv/do_you_sometimes_feel_like_youre_too_stupid_for/
How are you?,"  

How are you? One of the questions I hate the most. I have never answered this question truthfully.   
 

I am anxious. I am lost. I am sad and alone. I am a liar. I am hurt.   
 I am tired. I don’t know what to say or how to say it. I never learned how to express my emotions.   
 

I am awkward. I am an introvert. I hate compliments. I wish I had loving parents. I wish I had a loving mother. I wish I had a family. 

I am suffocating. I am afraid. I am delusional. I am optimistic and I am also pessimistic. 

I feel my heart hurting me. I am restless. I am an insomniac. I don’t know how I feel. I hate it. 

I have so many questions running through my head. I have always tried to understand. Can I even miss something that I have never had? 

My head is a mess. My thoughts are in disarray. I hate myself.   
 I hate how I am.   
 

I need help. I need to keep trying. Words don’t describe how I feel. I am angry. I want to scream. I want to cry. I am all alone and I don’t know what to do. I am pathetic.   
 

I am fake. I am smart. I am strong. I am a good teacher. I am hopeful and   
 I don’t need anyone. 

I need someone. I am ambitious. I am passionate. I am all right. I don’t know anything. I am clueless. I don’t want you to feel sorry for me I hate that. I need to stop.",Single-Engineer-6755,12,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6zids/how_are_you/

how the fuck am i supposed to get better if a hallmark symptom of depression is being too physically exhausted to initiate or keep up with tasks that would enable them to get better?,"i'm in online therapy. i have no access to a diagnosis, let alone a prescription for medication.

this is the worst and cruelest fucking catch 22 i've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. what am i supposed to do? the idea of CBT pisses me off. i know what's wrong with me. i know all the tricks that are supposed to help. i've spent almost every waking hour researching healthy coping mechanisms and neurology and the way mental illness in the brain works and what helps against it, why SSRIs and mood stabilizers work the way they do, watched every ted talk, every prestigious school's lecture about it, i've identified all of my problems and where childhood development might've been a factor in causing them, i've done _everything i could possibly think of._

and nothing.

but i'm still trying. and trying and fighting. and trying harder. and fOrCinG mYsElf. is forcing myself supposed to make me worse? because it makes me worse.

i can't fucking win. no matter what i do. i've done so much research. i've done so much reflecting. so much journaling. typed up a seven page document describing my problems and their roots in detail. why can i do that but i can't do something as simple as take showers, meditate, break tasks down into their simplest components, practice mindfulness, exercise, go on walks, eat healthily, drink enough water, get enough vitamin D, get enough B12, surround myself with good people who provide a strong support system, talk transparently and openly about my struggles with people, come up with a routine and a schedule, plan for the day ahead, I KNOW. i fucking know what i need to do. the problem is i can't DO IT. THAT'S WHAT DEPRESSION IS. i can talk about it until i'm blue in the face. but i can't fucking do anything about it.

everything hurts. moving hurts. my body hurts. my brain hurts. it keeps getting worse and i keep letting it because every attempt to pull myself out of this just ends in relapse and burnout. an invisible rubber band pulling me back to square one the harder i fight back. or worse, square zero.

i can't. i can't. i don't know how to get this through to anyone. i can't even get through to my therapist. they keep saying i'm responsible for my own recovery. that i need to follow through with the ""solutions."" that's reasonable, they're right, i know that. but i am physically and mentally UN. ABLE. TO.

i got scolded by my partner for using alcohol to self medicate last night. it was supposed to be tough love. it made me feel worse, i told him this, and he apologized for it. but i still want to pick up a bottle of wine from the cabinet right now, at 6am, and forget about all of this shit.

Creativity and Depression,"I know that I am a creative person and I'm very familiar with the correlation between creativity and mental health issues.

I was never “good” I’ve always been sad,"Im always feeling guilty. Even when it isn’t my fault. If there’s a fight between my family members and I’m not at fault I always think “this wouldn’t have happened if i didn’t exist” I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time but I thought that maybe it was because of the current times. But then I remember when i was about 8yrs old after a fight in my family i asked my sister if everything would be better if I didn’t exist. And that’s when I realised that maybe I’ve never been alright. Even after many years I’ve always thought that it would be better for everyone if I didn’t exist. I’m putting all these feelings inside me but that only achieved me doing self harm.

Experiences with Gabapentin as Antidepressant &amp; Social Anxiety Medication,"Hey, so I had some gabapentin from some time ago prescribed by my doc for my depression, social anxiety and psychosomatic pain (or whatever it is). 

Why Gabapentin? Because I have been completely therapy resistant to all the SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI as well as a tricyclic. I‘m also in behavioral therapy right now, just to let you know.

I only took 300mg every morning before breakfast for the last 7 days and well, it was more effective than any other med I tried. My depression was 90% vanished. My cognition (focus, memory, logical thinking) started being functional again. I didn’t feel dumbed out and cognitively retarded anymore. I even felt smart. I especially noticed  my better cognition in social events and conversations a lot but also at reading, following movies and just remembering general knowledge. My head didn‘t feel empty and dysfunctional anymore. My brain was working again.

It did more for my depression than my social anxiety but hell sure the cognitive improvements helped with socializing too. I still felt some kind of nervous before having to socialize but when I was in the social situation I was much more talkative, funny and social. I was enjoying my ability to think clearer, finally being cognitively more functional and definitely feeling some reduced social anxiety.

I know that my dose of 300mg is very low, so I think that a higher dose might not only help my depression and negative thinking but maybe also increase the social anxiety reducing effects.

What I would like to know of you guys:

1. If you have some experience with using Gabapentin for depression and/or social anxiety, what fose have you been on and what effects or changes did you notice regarding depression, negative thinking, mood, energy/motivation and especially social anxiety and sociability/talkativeness/extroversion.

2. Ive only been taking the gabapentin daily for 6 days now as I heard a lot about its withdrawals being hellish and horrible af. What‘s your opinion on this or do you eve have any experiences with withdrawals? How bad are they, how long do they last after how much time on daily gabapentin?

3. Is it possible to use gabapentin occasionally on a only if needed basis? Or is it needed for depression and anxiety disorders to take it daily for better effects and symptom reduction?Like 3-4 days a week only to hinder tolerance and withdrawal. That‘s what I would do it like if possible as I have experience with GABA withdrawals and they are not nice.

Gabapentin is the only thing that worked for me but it seems unrealistic to have and use it as a daily medication for my depression and social anxiety, I guess. What do you think? What are your suggestions?",Gottchen,5,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n70k01/experiences_with_gabapentin_as_antidepressant/
Does therapy really works?,"I can logically figure out patterns like why i'm feeling like this &amp; what's the right thing to do to make myself feel better, but still keep on behaving irrationally.

I know having a proper sleep cycle, regular exercise, eating healthy, being productive &amp; having some creative outlet will help relieve the negative emotions. But, nothing works for me &amp; then i fall into a pretty bad relapse. I become apathetic and can barely get out of bed.

It's weird how I can't figure out the reason behind my depression. Like fuck i've got a privileged life &amp; never faced any trauma, so why?

Is my IQ low or do I suffer from depression?,"Hi everyone, I terribly suffer with focus and I'm facing problems in many areas of my life. I feel like I'm slower than other people. 

If people speak to me, it's hard absorbing much of what they say and I usually zone out. I'm even unable to comprehend information while reading any article or a book. I usually have to read a sentence 5-6 times or more for it to stick in this shitty brain only to forget any knowledge my brain accumulated within a day. Lol 

While communicating my mind just freezes mid sentence and all the thoughts just vanish. It's embarrassing given that it happens in a social situation. I'm unable to socialize and enjoy the moment without my mind drifting. Even if it doesn't drift, my mind is totally blank hence I don't have any topic to talk about. 

It honestly sucks being this way and I'm constantly  being self-critical 24/7 judging every word I say and any task that goes wrong at work. I feel worthless with 0 self esteem. 

I don't even feel like working hard or socialising any more because no matter how much I try I'm only bound for failure. Regardless I'm still trying my best to progress in my career but what's the point if you always end up in the same situation? I'm average at best in my work and I'd like to learn more of what I don't know but it's frustrating living with the fact that your brain takes ages to retain information. 

My bosses appreciate me and say that I'm the best employee, even behind my back but what if they say that only to boost my confidence? Probably because they know about my personality. I feel like a fraud at times to be honest and every complement seems fake. 

Lastly, I'm severely depressed all the time and don't have the energy to do anything because of this. Is depression the culprit? IQ? Slow processing speed? ADHD? I don't know. I'm lost and all I'm seeking is guidance. I hope no one suffers like I do.

I've worked very hard to get to a point where I feel okay. I'm on a good combination of meds, I exercise daily, avoid process foods. I finally feel like I can function.

But every time I take my meds, it just reminds me that I need them to feel okay.

With exercise, I'm in a place where I have the time and energy, but what if my life gets busier. What if I get sick, or injured. Once again, I had an episode after I had to get a minor procedure done, and had to take a couple of days to recover. Once again, I felt like crap those few days.

"Depressive Episodes , Anxiety, Paranoia&amp; So Much Time Lost, Unbreakable Cycle and My Mental Health Hangs by a thread.","Hello, I’m 23 years Old Male, 4th Year Student. I’m here because I have depressive episodes , paranoia and social anxiety for years now and I just can’t break the cycle of wasting my life. 

No I’m not a suicidal, drunkard, smoker, drug, gaming or even a sex addict. What I’m trying to say is there are days where I literally stop doing anything for a day or a couple of days and do nothing except play games or read stories to escape reality(during  my worsts it lasted for a year or months but this hasn’t happened for the past 3 years). I should have graduated 3-4 years ago if not for my condition. I even  developed improper posture, extreme muscle imbalance and gait due to inactivity.

During my non-depressive episodes I’m extremely productive, I sing, play guitar, exercise, maybe study or clean the house(I haven’t really studied for years because this triggers my episodes due to stress, mostly attend class or pass all the requirement)

How does pandemic make this worse? I’m stuck in my house with my mother and sister. They STRESS ME OUT, they’re not aware of it and I don’t like them. They’re not abusive or bad, polar opposite of everything I guess? Including personality? I also can’t sing because I don’t want to spread saliva unintentionally (literally unstoppable for anyone singing). They always want to keep everything open cause it’s hot when I want to close doors when singing.

My Anxiety and paranoia involves thinking that everyone is looking at or talking about me, and knows something bad or like a scandal about me(Sometimes I even search). I know there is none though it’s only in my head but I can’t stop thinking about it, specially in public. The extremely weird thoughts I thankfully got rid already it 
rarely triggers now.

I was able to do a lot before this pandemic and episodes are becoming more frequent,  now it’s happens either weekly, or half a month where I won’t do anything for a few days.

This is only some of the issues there is much, much, much, much more. 

I know what I have to do, and I can do it. Only problem is I’m stuck. What do you think I should do? Truth be told? I don’t want your advice, I guess I just want to share.

I am a software engineer self taught, and since I was 14 (i am 25) I was introduced to BTC because in highschool I would buy weed and sell it off the darknet. So I had been speaking on crypto for years.

"My SO has a pretty severe depression as well as PTSD.

She asked what it was, so I explained it. 

I said ""I know you think it's weird, but it's something I've done since I was a kid!"" 

Then she said ""I don't think it's weird, I think it's pathetic."" 

Now, for context, her depression/anger comes in waves, and the last few days have been rough on her. Today she took longer to get out of bed than usual, so I knew it was going to be an off day (and that I should prepare myself mentally for that). I've learned, through plenty of deep, open discussions, that her PTSD causes her to misdirect her feelings, and as I happen to be the only other person around, I sometimes suffer the brunt of it. I'm not angry at her for it. I'm not trying to place blame. I know how little control she has right now, and how much of an inner battle she's going through. But when she says such hurtful things like that, I just feel my day darken. This cloud hangs over me and I can't stop thinking about it. I find it a struggle to focus on my work. I'm sensitive to stuff like that, and I can't help but feeling hurt no matter how much I try to understand that she didn't mean it.

In the beginning, I denied it, it was easier to fight and I had enough anxiety to fuel the lie.

Basically what im saying is, I still have depression but I also have coping skills. Like making sure i have easy to make food, allowing myself to have bad days. If I dont do the dishes right away, thats ok, I'll get them done.

Don't forget to cut yourself some slack.

I'm just waiting to die.,"Title says it all. I have wanted to die most of the time for 5 or 6 years at this point. I have strongly considered killing myself and I have obtained the means to do so, but I will not kill myself at least until my cat dies, as she does depend on me. I also want to wait until both of my parents have passed, so that they don't have to experience the trauma of losing a child in that way. These are the only people that I beleive the pain that they will feel from my suicide outweighs my own pain from having to continue living this pathetic life as this pathetic person. I do not want to live a full life.

In short I'm not actively suicidal and I won't be until these people/animal dies or my situation becomes far more untenable and my timetable moves up.

I'm at a point where I have no drive and no ambition to do anything besides sleep, try to sleep, drug myself into being able to sleep, and avoid my job. I'm not going to have a social life outside of work. I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend time with someone like me. I'm too much of a chicken shit coward to try and date women, so I will be alone forever in that regard as well. I'm done crying about this. I'm done making feeble attempts to change what is clearly just major flaws in my personality that make me a person that I do not like at all.

I'm literally just waiting for death to come. Either because there are no reasons left to live and I off myself or even better I get lucky and die of an accident or an illness that is outside of my control.

I am depressed after my longest period without being depressed.,"I haven’t been depressed since December last year. I got a new job that I started in January. I like the job and my colleagues, my work is going well, but perpetual home office has worn me down. I’ve probably been depressed for a few weeks at this point. Work is the only thing I have though. I’m single and alone all the time. Near all of my close friends are couples or share a space. My apartment looks like someone broke in. I feel like that if I stop working and acknowledge the situation then I’ll fall apart. There’s nothing else I do that adds value to the world. I’m so sick of this cycle.

Do not feel like i have much in common with others,"I am beginning to become a old grumpy fucker, I do not exactly love to be around people but i keep on living this lie i have lived all my life. Keeping up the facade and pretend i am just as happy as the rest of the people in my life. Always been independent and hate to rely on others. But my back have gone to hell and i am not as strong as i used to be, and that is hard to accept i work my self into the ground and pays the price a week after.  I am to young to be in this kind of state, my mind is still 21 and i do not think it will ever grow up. 

I have always been kind of a deviant soul and used that to forget about my depression, trying my hardest to think on ANYTHING else but the endless sadness that i feel when my mind is left to its own devises. 

I spent yesterday outside doing way to much and to day i am stuck inside, the brain starts to wander into darkness again and i can not fight back.

I have a lot of hobbies but i can not keep myself interested. It is fun for a week or 2 and then i loose interest and goes back to square 1. 

Been reading a bunch of virtual novels and listen to countless audio books, it helps then and there but the feeling of not belonging anywhere returns after a while.  I am nothing like the people i live amongst, i feel like a outsider everywhere i go. I live in a society i don\`t want any part of and i am forced to live like this by standards others have made for me long before i was born.  

I am living a lie and every time i wake up i play my part and just keeping up the appearance of a normal man just doing normal things.

I was born in the wrong place and the wrong time wrong species and wrong planet.

Things i have done in the past keeps on haunting me and will not let go even tho i was a child when it happened, i just want to dig my self a hole and end it. 

It will get easier i tell myself but when? In the meantime i am doing my best to smoke myself to death.

Depression on the ability spectrum,"Recently I heard the term ""ability spectrum"", as a strength based approach to the term ""disabilities"". I like it.

I'm recently coming into understanding my depression. It is hereditary, but I guess I've been in denial my whole life/functioning to a normal social standard.

Recently I've been through so much and have lost my ability to cope. I've started medication (Escitalopram) and I'm feeling better, but still sorting out my dosage. 

I struggle to do my job. Staying motivated to do something I really don't enjoy just to make money to be a part of this society seems pointless. The endless grind of work until you die... I could just die right now instead of doing this any longer.

At what point is depression so severe that one goes on disability? Is that common? I'm just learning how to support myself. If the end goal is to keep folks alive who struggle with depression, how many of us are on welfare/disability?

hate my fucjing mom.,"it’s currently 4:03am. this is the 3rd time i’ve cried today because of my mom. i have been trying to sleep since 3 but i can’t stop crying. almost every morning or sometime in the day my mom yells at me. it’ll be 9am and i’ll still be sleeping and she’ll open my door and yell extremely loud. once she wanted me to clean the chicken  Coop and i told her i needed to shower. later when i was in the shower she started to bang and yell and even try to get into the bathroom. im terrified of her. i hate when she yells at me and whenever someone even just walks outside of my bedroom door i freak out. same with taking a shower. i cant without basically having a panic attack thinking i’m going to get yelled at, walked in on or dragged out. she always tells me how she’s “not the bad guy” and she’s just trying to “wake me up” because i need to understand how the “real world” will be . “you’re just selfish and miserable” “maybe if you would thinking of anyone else besides yourself and your phone” “i think you like being miserable” i can’t do it. i just want to live with my dad but i can’t bc my mom has 
custody over me. she is trying to take me, my brother, her soon to be husband, and his kids to nevada. i already want to fucking kill myself and if i have to go to nevada i will 100% do it. i just want her  to take me seriously, so maybe if she finds me dead she finally will. my mom won’t let me  stay with my dad. now that i have written this all down my problems don’t seem like problems at all. i just hear her voice in my head yelling at me to “get up, do school, clean my room, and do what you need to do.” then slamming the door as hard as she could.

I'm a 23 year old man, jobless, virgin and depressed.

Sad start, but it's what it is.

Right now i'm stuck in life, i don't know how to get free from this constant fear that i'm feeling torwards basically everything.

I fear what i eat will ruin my looks and health.

I fear everything i say because i might say something wrong.

I fear breathing the air because of particals, dust, chemicals, bacteria so on.

I fear that i might or do look bad.

I fear the pitch of my voice.

I fear my future to much and that i will be a complete failure.

I fear i will die a virgin.

I fear to be in an accident and maybe become handicapped.

I fear death and what it means.

I fear i will loose my friends.

I fear people hate me.

I fear that me and my family will become homeless because our economy suck

and the apartment is in a terrible condition witch the landlord wont like.

I fear i will never be able to play instruments again cause maybe my hands

will get ruined by the constant inflamations i have.

I fear i will never be able to sing because of my tonsils witch doctors

I fear i will loose my hearing for wearing headphones so much.

I fear that i will never get money because of my bad grades or never having a real job.

I fear stress.

I fear i might be stupid or that i'm to  self centered.

I fear that i will look like an idiot for writing this on reddit.

I guilt myself for everything wrong i've done and fear i get judged by people, i've never

Ok you get the point, i fear so many useless things and it's consuming my life to the point where i get no motivation to live life the way i want.

It's getting to the point where i just wonder my self into internet and then i've spended the day

watching Youtube and then when i finally get the motivation to do something i just get into a panic state and escape back into internet again or do something else to escape.

Read it if you want,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old guy and I feel bad, really bad.
 I feel like I've never been normal, I see all the people  living their lives and I'm trapped in mine.
 I just want to talk to someone, and I will do it here because in my real life I have no one to do it with.
 I am really tired of my life, and the coronavirus has fucked me up even more.

 As a child I had a fairly normal life, or I was too young to notice if something was wrong.
 Shortly after my eleventh birthday my parents separated, the court entrusted me to my mother, psychologically and verbally very violent towards me, my brother ran away from home the following year and went to live with my father,  he was the only person I ever talked to about my personal stuff, since that time I've never had any real friends or anyone I could talk about what i wanted.
 My mom brainwashed me into believing my dad was a piece of shit, I haven't seen him since I was 14 and i don't see my brother from when im 15.

 In the meantime, my mom found a partner, and she convinced me to let him adopt me and change my surname. I hate him, he's an ignorant, impulsive and rude person.
 Moreover, after a year he fell ill with a degenerative neurological disease, becoming a huge problem for me and my mother.

 And finally my mother, violent and mentally unstable, always takes a lot of pills to treat depression, anxiety etc. and does not seem to be a very lucid person, also showing signs of bipolarism and schizophrenia in my opinion .
 When I say she is violent, I mean violent, very violent, she makes me feel like shit, she screams all day, I wake up with her screaming at me and go to sleep with her screaming.
 she gossip about me with her friends, saying how much I'm a bad son etc.and telling all my personal things, it often embarrasses me in front of other people yelling at me in public.

 All this is not good for my mental health at all, it has made me a very close person, I feel very uncomfortable when I am with other people, even if I don't know them (for example, just sitting on the bus gives me an absurd anxiety) so I avoid going out and lock myself in my room, expecially after covid.
I feel lost and alone, I feel like no one can understand or help me.
I am looking for a job for this summer in order to be busy and maybe work away from home, so I don't have to see them, but despite having sent my resume to a hundred places, I have found nothing.
 If this continues, this summer I would almost certainly run away from home and end up living on the street because I have nowhere to go, and I wouldn't even be able to finish school. I can't go on like this. The only problem is that if I leave, I'm afraid that after a while I will end up trying to commit suicide.",No-Mechanic-8607,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n7603m/read_it_if_you_want/
"Apparently it's my fault for not talking, apparently it wasn't wrong to insult someone","One of the worst things to happen to me this year. So our house will have a power interruptions every Thursday so we will have to go to our aunt's boyfriend's house. First time I was there it was ok, some few insults here and there we eat on a table then sleep, nothing special. But the second time I was there earlier was hell. 

We stayed at that house for about 1 and a half day much longer than the last time. Somehow being at that house gives more power to my sister to the point where if someone just mentions my name she would slip in an unnecessary insult like ""he's just like that, he (random insult)"" and it happens from time to time and no one gives a shit and if I got mad my aunt would tell me to just calm down and that they were just joking around.

When it was nighttime already I was just about to go to sleep but I heard my aunt's boyfriend say ""so, he's just going to be like that living a boring life"" as if it's his problem and I ended up crying under the sheets. The amount of ""he's really just like that"" insults I got is overwhelming and noone stood up once for me. 

Another bad thing is that my aunt would do something for me and then say that I'm spoiled for not doing it myself, like I didn't even ask you to do something for me so how am I spoiled. And then here comes my sister and my aunt's boyfriend loudly talking about how I'm basically just dead weight without actually saying it ""he's really just like that, he always needs someone to do things for him"" and ""so it's like free service, lucky"" like I said I didn't ask for the ""help"" and I didn't even want it.

The next morning, everyone was still asleep while my aunt woke up early and I wasn't really able to get any sleep and so time passed we got to talk about how I wasn't saying anything and so I found this as a chance to finally say what I want. I told her that I have trouble communicating (I didn't say I have social anxiety, because she obviously know nothing it). I was telling her about their insults at me is not just a joke and that I was actually hurting. My eyes were getting watery just because I was finally able to say it but aunt just disregarded it ""we were just kidding don't get so mad about it, you should start talking if you don't want to get made fun of"" because apparently the people who were making fun of someone isn't the wrong one. I was actually pissed off now, so I told her why do people who are shy always get this type of treatment and her response to me was basically 'woah, that's so deep anyways don't get so mad'.

And so time passed same as usual, I was outside I wasn't allowed to just stay inside the bedroom because ""if everyone is outside then you should be outside too (probably to just attack me and put me out of my comfort zone)"" my sister with the increased amount of insults from time to time the topic turns to me. My aunt's boyfriend with the sarcasm againts me as if he knows me well enough. We were eating and my aunt somehow randomly talked about if I ever get a girlfriend she would be here too (which was absolutely off-topic to the conversation they were having and is an obvious bait for my sister to attack) ""I wonder when the time would come hahahahahaha"" and again time went by as usual.

My aunt told me I should learn to communicate and that if I'm going home I should say ""Thank you, goodbye"" to them because idk. When It was finally my time to leave since my father was outside to pick me up already. I went to the door and my aunt was looking at me. I already know what she wants me to say. I left and I wasn't even able to say ""Thank you, goodbye"" to them I just said a really quiet ""bye"" which made me feel bad and then they repeated my ""bye"" in an upset mocking tone.

I'm not really this quiet and shy around people, only with the people Im uncomfortable and don't get along with which made it worse since I wasn't able to speak up aside from that one time (that got disregarded).

I even made a poll about it before because I don't really know what I should do.

Some days I just can't function,"I have work today, or games I want to enjoy, things I want to create, but I just can't. I don't feel like this all time but sometimes it just hits me and I have to push off all my assignments and ""be nice to myself"". I don't want to be nice to myself. I want to get my work done so I can relax. I just have one final left. I got one section done but everything came to a halt. I can't bring myself to finish it. 
""That's okay, I'll take a break, maybe I can work on my music"" but I can't do that either. Maybe I'll open up my DAW and listen to my current project. I'll listen to it over and over again recalling that time a few months ago when I could do anything. 
""That's okay, I'll play a game instead"" but I can't do that either. None of my hundreds of options sound fun. I am paralyzed by choice. I remember how I couldn't get passed that level. Or how I kept losing matches. Maybe I'll open a more casual game a get bored after 5 minutes. 
""That's okay, I'll watch YouTube"". I mindlessly skip the most engaging videos in favor of shitty compilations or even just spend most of my time trying to find a video that can give me a pinch of seratonin. 
I devolve to reddit. I scroll mindlessly again. I feel worse by the minute as I upvote mildly interesting posts and scoff at mediocre memes. I have a snap of clarity but just remember my responsibilities and let myself drown in the scrolling again. 
I remember that I shouldnt be on my phone so much. But what else can I do? I end up just laying on the floor. Just blankly staring at the carpet. My mind just keeps sinking deeper and deeper into stale misery. 
I finally get to that place. ""I wish I was dead"". I brush past it since I've thought that thousands of times before. 
I sigh and get up. Maybe I'll get sometime to eat. Maybe I take a walk. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe I let myself watch YouTube the rest of the day. Maybe I actually force myself to get more work done. Maybe I just pass around my house until it's too late to do anything (even though it's only 4pm). 

This time I started writing this post. My therapist told me to reach out to these kinds of communities. ""Sure, why not"". I've been thinking about getting anti-depressants (it's about time). I told my family and they were worried. I hate it when they're worried about me (shit is that a bad thing to think). Sometime I feel like I'm making progress. Yesterday was pretty good. Maybe I'll go take a walk and get a snack. Maybe it'll work this time. Maybe I'll stare at the wallpaper on my computer: the New York Skyline. Maybe I'll name the 5 biggest buildings. Maybe that'll make me feel smart, like I have value. Maybe I'll remember how prentenious I am. This post it's self is all poetic and shit. Maybe I'll acknowledge that I'm a decent writer. 

I sigh. I think I'll take a walk and maybe eat something. My legs won't move but I know they can. I guess I gotta stop writing this first. I think I'll come back later and read your generic replies. Maybe this time it'll feel kinda good to know there's other people who feel the same way.

I literally can’t take this shit much longer.,"I know this probably sounds the same as like 95% of the posts on here but holyyyyy hell this really sucks. I always have like a week or two where I’m doing good (exercising, eating healthy, putting efforts into my appearance, trying to be productive overall) then I go back to being in bed all day. Suicidal thoughts are an everyday constant thing for me and I always thought I would never do it but to have to live every single day with my brain just telling me to kill myself CONSTANTLY is so fucking debilitating. It feels like my brain is just begging me to put a bullet in it and that in itself is so tiring. I have so many goals and hobbies and such but I can’t do any of them. I feel like I’ll never be successful or have a career or my own place. The thought of getting stuck at some monotonous 9-5 for my whole life sounds like a literal living hell. The worst part is that since I always get better for a week or two, people around me just assume I’m that way all the time or don’t even really notice the depressive episodes and they think I work out and eat healthy all the time. No body cares. I eat and eat and eat in order to self soothe. I literally eat until it hurts to move, then I starve myself for days cuz I feel so bad about it. It seems like the longer I’m alive, the more mental disorders I accumulate. I fucking hate this.

Chest pain/ neuro smth pain ?,"Hi everyone! I’d really like to hear some advice on the topic below! Personal experience will be much appreciated! 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and been on medication for 9 months (first cipralex and then venlafaxine) and it definitely helped me, I feel much better in general. However, the first reason I went to psychiatrist was severe chest pain (like guilt feeling), that some times went up to my throat ( felt like suppressed urge to cry or smth). Doctor said that physical side of depression goes away much faster than thoughts and stuff like that. But it didn’t go away at all and didn’t get better. 

In some way I’ve already lost hope to cure this shit. I’m not even sure what’s it called, like neurotypic pain, or what?

I just feel so drained,"
Honestly, I don’t if there’s a real point to this, I’m just trying to write it out and figure my shit out.
I’ve had depression and anxiety since I was in middle school and I finally started getting the help I needed after years of trying to convince my parents that religion wasn’t going to fix it. I’m in therapy and I’m taking medication and I’m trying to make progress but it’s so fucking hard. I didn’t realize how much shit I had bottled up inside until now. I never realized how much the people in my life that claim to love me disrespected me. Growing up, my parents never valued anything I had to say, they were always just so anxious about everything and never had any confidence in me. They constantly hovered over me and just took over anything I wanted to do because “they want to show me and help me how to do it.” They would just disregard all of my feelings and it felt like the only thing that mattered to them were my grades. To them, my grades were a good indicator of how I was doing in all other aspects of my life. I was hitting my head against the wall, crying, and calling myself stupid because I didn’t do well on a pop quiz when I was 7. They didn’t realize how much of a problem this was until I kept getting panic attacks in class and had a breakdown in front of them because I was just worried about my grades in high school. Even after my doctor told them I should be in therapy and possibly medication, they just thought praying in the morning would fix it. 

They constantly told me I was fat and tried to put me on these crazy diets that they themselves never followed since I was 10. Anytime we would go out or even just eat dinner at home, they would just eye the food I got, how much I’ve eaten, tell me how bad everything was for me, and have yelled at me in public over it. They’ve yelled at me for literally eating the same thing as my brother. FYI most of what I ate were vegetables and fucking quinoa but that didn’t matter to them. To this day, I still get uncomfortable eating in public and I’ve just stopped eating in front of them. Any time I actually went to the gym and felt good about myself, they would tell me that I didn’t go for long enough or work hard enough because I wasn’t drenched in sweat. Whenever I asked them why they didn’t do any of the things they yelled at me to do, they would just say that they needed motivation and asked why I wasn’t motivating them to come with them. I’d constantly feel guilty because it felt like I was responsible for their health and any time I fucked up, they would also get sicker idk. 

The only reason they’ve come around and finally started to listen to me was because my brother stopped talking to them once he went to college. But at that point, the damage was already done. My friends didn’t respect and I was constantly the butt of the joke for most of my childhood and my self-esteem was so low I never stood up for myself and didn’t think there was anything wrong with what they were doing. I never put two and two together and figured out why I was always so anxious and sick to my stomach every time they asked me to hang out. They did eventually kind of stop and apologize but I don’t know, I just kind of always felt like the second choice and disposable to them. I felt as though if I opened up to them about how I felt about myself, they would just pity me and I didn’t want that. I’m 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship or even gone out on a date. Even though I’ve had guys like me and pursue me, the minute they show interest in me I panic and try to find a flaw in them.  As I’ve grown up, I have been told I was pretty and funny but idk the thought of someone actually being interested in me romantically is so fucking weird. I literally can’t wrap my mind around it. I used to think that I had a great personality and all I had to do was lose weight until I could actually be attractive but now it’s just the opposite. I kind of feel like a shell of a human being. I feel like my intelligence, humor, and generosity aren’t genuine, they feel superficial and I feel like I’m mimicking someone with those traits, and once people start to get close to me, they’ll realize there’s nothing there but self-loathing. There’s nothing good I can offer someone and the only way I can compensate for that is my body and I can’t do that until I lose weight. The only way I can feel vulnerable and/or desirable is when I’m absolutely shitfaced and have disappointing one night stands that just make me feel even more disgusting.

I’m graduating this weekend and all I can think of was ways I could have been better at school or just smarter. I only focus on my failures. I could have graduated early but I was so depressed and I was terrified I was actually gonna go through with hurting myself and didn’t do well. I know this is a valid thing and I’m trying to show myself more compassion but I just feel like a fuck up all the time. I feel guilty because I know my parents are trying their best and I don’t know if I’m just being really sensitive about everything. I know I should be grateful for the opportunities they gave me and for everything they’ve sacrificed so that I can have a better life and I am but I just feel like I’m spoiled, I’m not doing enough and just taking too much. I am so fucking tired of feeling this way all the time and I know I won’t make it long if I continue to have this thought process but every time I actually think about the issues I feel like I need to work on, I just feel exhausted because they just seem so deep-rooted. I’ve felt this way for so long I can’t really imagine a me that loves and respects herself and I feel like I can’t live my life and go after what I want until I’ve become that person. Idk, if I’m just complaining too much because I do have a good life but I just really needed to write out what I’ve been feeling.",roosterlem,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n750jq/i_just_feel_so_drained/

I don't have any actual plans, but I feel like the state of being dead is much more peaceful and much better than being alive.

I want to give up.,"I have been struggling the past several months of my life. I am only 19, though life has been changing so quickly for me and I am not very adaptive to changes. 

I have spent the last two years of my life with the plan of getting into nursing school. I achieved an AA in liberal arts and got all of my pre-requisite courses done for the nursing program.  I then took the entrance exam for the nursing program, got a high score, and was instantly accepted into my local Community College's ASN program. I start in 6 days.

The only problem is- I don't know if I want this. I just don't know... I will have to drive and hour both to and from the college. I'll have to wake up at 5 AM just to get to class by 8:00 AM Monday-Friday. Not to mention my mother has already laid down thousands of dollars just to pay for some of my textbooks because she's excited for me. My passions have always lied within art, music, reading, etc... I have always been the creative/caring type of person. I've started making music lately and have found that it brings me so much happiness- but I hate that I discovered the happiness it brings me right before my program is about to begin. I feel like I've ran out of time. 

I also recently had a breakup. It ripped me apart. I still cry about him and think about him every day. I've been feeling so lonely and lost lately- I just wish I had someone here to comfort me. I just want to drop everything and leave the planet. I don't know what to do with the rest of my life on this earth. I am genuinely scared. I'm also sick and tired of all the disappointment I feel. Disappointment from friendships, from relationships, from family.  Every time I believe I have something wonderful- it just falls apart. 

I know, in many ways, life is a beautiful thing. I love to feel love. I love to see the beauty of a simple mountain terrain. I love to see how I can brighten other people's days. But I lost the person I love. I lost the freedom to pursue my passions. I lost the freedom to travel. I lost the freedom to be able to sit and not be overwhelmed by anxious thoughts.

quitting antidepressants,"so i've dealt with depression for a while now and have been on antidepressants before (about 8 years ago, took them for a year or so). went back on them last year and took them for about 12 months (i was on citalopram), stopped taking them a bit over two months ago, felt great for a few weeks and am now back to being miserable as fuck. i honestly don't feel too comfortable going back on them due to the arsenal of sideeffects i had from them (my therapist recommended starting to take them again if my mood doesn't change for the better), has anyone else experienced anything similar and is it something that passes as the body has to adapt to the new situation without psychopharmaca or am i relapsing?

has anyone had similar experiences and can give me some advice ? thanks a lot &lt;3",elsenorfluffybutt,1,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n73mpv/quitting_antidepressants/
I have stopped most of my body hygiene because I just can't.,"I haven't showered in over a month or two, I don't even remember. I think that this year I have showered once or twice so far. I haven't washed my teeth correctly in well over a year or two. Up until a few months ago I had at least been brushing them slightly from time to time just for the surficial looks in the occasional smiling or when speaking, but now a tooth brush hasn't touched my teeth for a long time. Wearing a mask anyway, nobody gets to see them. I haven't shaved for quite a while too. It looks wild but I guess it's not that bad. I just can't bring myself to care enough. I've stopped caring. And I don't know why. Is that normal? Is it a self-defense mechanism?

I am aware that the teeth thing is not good at all for me, but I just... can't bring myself to it. I'm bringing my body down and I can't help it. I just see no point. Neither do I in cleaning or doing household. I'm currently with my parents due to pandemic-related reasons, but if I was living alone I'd probably end up... living in complete chaos and either starve or eat extremely unhealthy snacks, because I wouldn't be able to bring myself to cook. I've also already gained quite some weight recently.

I am ""studying"", which means that I still don't have any clue what to do with my life, but am registered at university in a subject that I absolutely hate and know I don't want to study, but still I'm registered and pretend, for now, until I find a way out of this. I want to study something I'm happy with but I don't know what that could be.

At the moment I am just either at work (part time) or at home, being on the computer all day and playing games or doing whatever I can just for trying to cope with all of this... existential crisis or whatever it is, I don't know what name would fit it. And inbetween, I'm sleeping. Work, sleep, eat, game, wanting this to end, thinking about a way out and finding none, sinking deeper and deeper and deeper... that's my life right now.
Speaking of sleep, my rythm is the opposite of consistent, it shifts all the time... Yesterday I woke up 10 minutes before having to go to work. The day before, I woke up hours earlier than that. I actually wanted to go to sleep at 4:00 but ended up gaming until 8 and then had been looking at my phone until 13:00 (all before sleep). I sometimes look at things on my phone for hours at a time, wasting time... memes or whatever it is... I don't know what I'm even looking for.

And then work again, always, everyday. At least I'm gettinf some money with that. Sleep - proper sleep - is the only time where there's a chance of finding some peace, an attempt of hitting that inner ""restart"" button, if you're lucky and have a good sleep. When your back problems don't prevent you from that. Back problems that you shouldn't have in your early to mid twenties...

I feel like a failure. Life feels terrible, I have no idea what to do in it as a career to live from, and the best I've got so far is my highschool diploma which is essentially nothing. A bad grade on top of that, for reasons very related to the ones you see here. I've lost many years with this ""studying"" and I can't afford to lose any more. And the pandemic makes it all worse. I should be in my student's flat, studying, living an at least okay life, starting to get independent and have an own little household, meeting new people and making new acquaintances and friends, maybe finding someone to date and have a relationship with..... instead, _this_ .....
can't see anyone, time goes by, no end in sight..... isolation and depression. That's it for now.

I'm lonely. Haven't seen my few friends that I have in quite a while. Regarding lovelife, I think you first have to have a life that is not such a mess in order to be able to date someone or lead a proper, healthy relationship or have a chance for it... Well I don't really know when that will be...
I actually was in a relationship up until recently. But it was an abusive one, sadly. I got cheated on and it was overall very toxic. It was also my first relationship. I miss her but I know that it's wrong and leads nowhere except to more suffering and pain, and I'm trying hard to get over it. I've had an experience and don't know when the next time and try will be. I'll just wait until then. And I hope that next time it will be better.

Everything, everyday, feels like falling apart..... I don't know why, or what it is. Life shouldn't be like this, should it? Why does life feel so..... empty and meaningless? I don't want it to be like that. I want it to be good, I want to be happy. I don't want anyone to feel like how I feel right now. Gosh, where's the way out?

I currently have an idea of a plan. I'm thinking about quitting my job and switching studies, and using the time until next semester to prepare and maybe learn some extra skills..... not having to work everyday surely would have the effect of me being less exhausted and less needy of cooldown, or so I think.... I don't know. I just hope that everything will somehow work out in the end.

I'm scared of the thought of being alone and sad for my whole life, really frightened. If that's life then life isn't worth living. It would be suffering, except for the little up's of it. Well, there would be family... but still suffering. Other than that it would consist of these everyday ""calmers"" that are supposed to distract us from merciless reality for a moment, and gice us some nice feeling... like Netflix for example. I love movies, and series too, but I hardly ever even get to watch something anymore..... I just don't find the power for it. I think that I'm kinda mire addicted to the interactivity stimulation of video games, and need it..... even if I'd rather watch a movie sometimes.

I didn't want to bother anyone with this and I apologize if I did. I just...needed to write this, I don't know why or how it came but it happened, I needed to get this off my soul and just write it down, some kind of venting I guess.....
I don't even know why it was right now.

i don’t know how to feel sad.,"since childhood, i have been a very optimistic person. but lately, i have been feeling this “void” in my chest. i have been through some real shit. a terrible verbally abusive relationship, low grades, okayish college and lost a lot of friends/close people; which gave me recurring nightmares and lucid dreams.

i cried a lot in 2018 and 2019 but i noticed a trend. i would cry hard but i wouldn’t feel sad after. isn’t the pain supposed to linger and remind you of the hard times?? but no, i slapped on a smile and did a little dance, and somehow i made myself believe that everything is okay. i would keep telling myself that “everything happens for a reason and the best is yet to come.”

one thing you need to know about me is that i’ve never been good at communication. no matter what form: reading/writing/listening. not physically impaired. i just cannot for some reason, express what im feeling. i am extremely emotional (a pure water sign) but i haven’t been able to find an outlet.

ngl, things did get a little better. i started socialising and made some friends. i even started getting along with everybody at home. ever so often, i would distance myself from everyone and sit in my room, feeling numb. this has happened A LOT of times in the past year and i feel like it has accumulated into the “void” i mentioned earlier.

how do i get out of this fake-optimisim i have been slapping on for all these years??

Inspirational Poem (05/07/21),"# The Wind, One Brilliant Day

*by Antonio Machado*

The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.

""In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.""

""I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.""

""Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.""

The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself: ""What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?""

**I'll introduce myself a little to you can know me**: I wasn't of this way. 4 years ago, I was a person who didn't have a tough depression but I went to a psychiatrist because I suffered from anxiety and a slight depression. I always was a person who smiled every day, I had a girlfriend and always had a lot energy.

***1 person: ""Everything you're going through is your fault for not being more mentally strong""***  
*2 person: ""I know, I've thought everything about you're tell me thousand times and everything about you're told me tell me over and over again, I tried to change it and I'm struggling to be able change it. I don't want to stay like this.*  


***1 person: ""The depression's not real, when I was young passed for the same and I never had depression. Everything's in your mind.***

Constantly feeling crap about myself,"I've been feeling incredibly shit about myself since last September and I am struggling to understand how I can keep going on like this. Lockdown kicked this all off for me as I've never experienced anything like this in my life before. Last year I was furloughed from April to July and I was perfectly fine during that, went back to work in August then come September that's when I started to feel like this.

As I was out of normal routine and not able to do anything other than work and best home, I found myself alone with my thoughts going over what I have done with the soon to be 28 years of my life. And I've pretty much hate myself for how I've led it so far.

I was bullied all the way through school to the point of near suicide, messed up my relationships with the only 2 girlfriends I've had in my life and have been single since I was 14 with no luck since, wasted my 2 years at college doing a music course that I'd never use for a career, went into the Army at 19 only to fuck my knees up and come out at the age of 20 halfway through trade training, spent 2 years working a dead end job and now working a current job that I started as an apprentice but now stuck there as I haven't got the skills or experience to go elsewhere.

Still living with my parents at my age and I can't afford to move out and get my own place, I have no friends of my own or any social circles, I'm too shy, have an introverted personality and suffer from social anxiety which is preventing me from making new friends and getting into a relationship with anyone.

I'm never going to finish my book.,"There. I said it.

The thought has been around for years now, but I've been too afraid to ever state it. Because how could I? I've given up on my schoolwork. I'm stuck in a major I'd rather kill myself than work in. My entire life plan is to make a living off this book, which is a pretty shit plan considering how hard it is to make it in publishing, but I've managed to delude myself into believing that I'm writing the next big thing. Luckily for me, I'll never have to deal with that delusion shattering because I'm never going to get to the point where I have anything remotely ready to publish.

I really do want to finish this book. I love my characters. I love my world. I love writing. Or do I? You'd think that if I love writing, I'd have more than a quarter of my first draft done when I've been working on the book for three years. 

I'm not going to lie: writing this post is almost getting me fired up. Like I have something to prove. But I know how it's going to go. How it always goes. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to open up my document, get focused, and write a few sentences, maybe even a paragraph if I'm lucky. Then I'll get distracted. Stop to go to class. Oh wait, I'm hungry, gotta go get some food. I can't write while I'm eating. Hmm, I'm not really in the mood, I'll do it tonight. Then that night I'll write a few sentences of absolute dogshit because I can barely keep my eyes open, say fuck it and go to bed. The next day will be better. Yeah right. That's what I've been telling myself for the last three years. I obviously don't care enough to bother working on it. I'll probably graduate next year, get a job I hate, and off myself before I hit halfway on the first draft.

my mom literally almost died last year, and i didn't even know what i was supposed to feel, i still don't know actually

the only thing that i feel is anxiety, from times to times(almost every month) i wake up really angry with this emotional numbness, then i have a bad crisis for the entire day, i sleep, and it loops

you know those small details that makes you smile a little? maybe you saw a cute cat, maybe a funny video, just random stuff
even those things don't ""work"", every single time i smile, i feel like i'm just faking it


oh and i struggle a lot if my relationships, i usually ignore my friends for idk how many days, i have no energy to meet new people, but at the same time i don't want to be alone(this sounds so toxic, sorry :/)
this is one of the things that make me feel like complete shit, i feel like i am only SUPPOSED to be their friend instead of actually being it? i always try to be really kind with everyone, but do i actually MEAN it?
i don't even know how to describe this, it's just bad and it makes me sound like a toxic person(and honestly, i probably am, and i hate it)


it's almost like i don't exist, or like i'm just watching my life going on without having control over anything

so yeah i don't know if this will ever go away or if i even want it to go away(i've been like that for so long that idk anymore)

honestly i just wanted to talk about this",littleyumii,3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6usn7/feeling_empty_and_stuff/
Lessen the burden at least,With me being 23 and never worked for more than a month or two at a time (which was literally a year or two ago) and leeching off my mother and step father that I in no way shape or form deserve with how supportive and caring they are; I always think about how if and when I finally say fuck it and off my shit. I'd probably clean and pack my room up neatly for them while they were away and spot clean their entire house (even though I can barely keep my room or myself clean to the bare minimum) then take my ass out back and lay my head off the back slab of concrete and blow my shit into the grass so I wouldn't be any more of a burden to them and not make a mess they would have to deal with. Am I the only one that thinks like that? My parents are saints (except my sperm donor) and once shit goes down I wouldn't want to be just another problem I cause for them to have to deal with.

Do you think its feeling completely defeated after the smallest of setback/ inconvenience/ remark that proves to you that your system is indeed just depressed?,"Some may call it hypersensitivity, but in my situation for instance- there is someone asking me for a sum of money that I know they don't deserve/have earned. (also asked for it in cash , so already it shows they want it off the books)

Even though I know I am in the right I am feeling really anxious about the confrontation soon, my intention was to ask to breakdown the costs/ say how its too steep for what i got / is daylight robbery lol (basically am getting charged for a service I didn't even avail of)

In addition to this, any mean remarks/ comments from my family just throws me into the gutter. It's like it sucks any remaining energy left and I just crash on my bed wanting to sleep forever. They know how I'm feeling as I am in the midst of a mental breakdown after 4 years of denial how I was feeling and numbing myself with binge watching/eating or either getting dismissed by so called mental health professionals, (for either being too severe to be able to help me or not severe enough to be able to help me) .  I also have the bad habit of replaying unhappy events in my life or even smug remarks from shits laughing at me at school, whom knew nothing of my circumstances- I'm 21 now and hindsight is 20/20 and I acknowledge a lot has happened in my teens so I should cut me some slack for having 0 motivation/ being perceived to be dopey I realize my system was still depressed!!!!

I also find it hard to even be happy over actual positive things - like getting predicted grades in my country to progress to 3rd level. My lack of happiness over such potential good things like a real opportunity of actually getting accepted into  a college makes me just realize how much I must be depressed and in a sad negative head space.

 I think get real anxious about 3rd level as I have a fear thinking if i couldn't handle 2nd level how am I meant to handle 3rd level material, and have the motivation to do so? ?? I wouldn't mind i know EXACTLY what I want to do with my life, I just find it hard to get out of bed or actual concentrate , so obviously my system doesn't match with my true self .  Took literally 5 years to realize this is what it is cause i thought I was a motivated person as I had ambition :(((

All underneath this I feel like my true self is a bad bitch even over the past 10 years there has been a no. of times where I felt genuinely happy, although the vast majority of perceived happiness (smiling, laughing and bublineess was just over compensation) I genuinely feel like Robbin William. I also feel like I am just hidden under layers of depression and anxiety right now, and the isolation isn't helping me. 

Just want to be happy. I will never ever forget the way my family have treated me in this situation and I will be sure to keeo my distance in future when i overcome this hopefully as i dont want 2 be like thd\]is forever",pizzalover2000,5,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6t8a6/do_you_think_its_feeling_completely_defeated/

I Have A Weird Memory Of My Sisters Friends Doing Something To Me When I Was A Kid,"Heck so I don't even know how old i was quite honestly i'd guess between 4 and 5. This one time my sister had her friends round, she is the year above me at school but she and some of her friends are nearly 2 years older than me as they are like october-december birthdays and i am in august so that would make them between 6 and 7. Basically my bedroom now used to be my sisters, that's why i have an estimate of the age but not exact. So, she had her friends round, they are quite chavy and come from quite trashy families imo, but they (i think there was 3 possibly 4, but i don't remember who the 3rd or 4th was i only know 2 for sure) were in her room (now my room) with my sister playing nurses and playing with dolls as girls do. I was just sat in there probably playing with cars and my pretend red stethoscope i had or some shit. But anyway, my sister goes down stairs to talk to my mum, and her friends put me on the bed and pulled my trousers and pants off, i don't remember anything after that, until i'm looking at my dick whilst pulling my pants up leaving the room. 

Wth happened and why don't i remember it? Like surely if it was just something innocent like they were checking my balls for cancer... wait, what, what actual innocent thing could they have been doing? Giving my dick a checkup? But surely i'd remember, if i remember before and after. And also they were so young, surely they can't have done something not innocent, like who that age is aware or even thinks to do anything bad like that? A couple year later though, one, maybe 2 of these girls pinned up a friend of mine against a wall and beat him up for nothing, he was such a nice kid. He and they would only have been age 7-9 when that happened, so i guess there are some just bad eggs

I don't remember feeling bad about what happened though, so i guess it wasn't something bad.

What if I dont want to get better?,"Am I just attention seeking? I have considered several times to go to my school counsellor for help, but I think to myself again: What am I going there for? What could she possibly do to help me? Do I even want to get better?

I have been having suicidal thoughts for at least 3 years now, but havent told anyone I know about it, except for tiny hints that I'm not ok which they ignore anyways. I never went for counseling during that period, since the first and only time I had went was in Primary school where I was bullied, and nothing good came out from it. 

I dont know what is wrong with me and dont know what the purpose of counseling or therapy is. If it is to heal, do I even want it in the first place? I cant seem to see a world where I am actually happy, and thinking about it makes me feel queasy inside anyways. I just feel like the world is bleak and anything that happens in life, good or bad, are merely events that shouldnt have emotions tied to them. And that's a reason why I feel so neutral everyday, except for the few days I go to bed crying from a very depressive day. But then again, am I just faking it for attention? I cant tell.

Overcoming depression,"Hi guys!

I am new to this subreddit but I am searching for help. I am desperate actually.
I know that healing from depression might be quite a long process but can you guys give me some tips? Unfortunately I cannot afford therapy now and I do not have a lot of friends so basically I m pretty on my own.
I do not have energy of doing anything. After I have one or two productive days (doing chores, doing some workout, maybe study a little bit) I will have a week of staying in home, sleeping 10+hours etc. I am doing almost nothing during the day, cannot find energy even for daily tasks.
If I am not doing anything during the day, I get a little bit anxious during the night before falling asleep.
I had the ""i gotta start now"" and ""i will do it now""  thoughts but unfortunately I had no succes. 
I just feel something is wrong and broken in me and I do not know how to fix it. 
I just feel like I am at the rock bottom. 
I am pretty sure that I can not overcome it alone, but I just need some tips to start, when I ll be able to afford some therapy, definetely I will do it.

I am living alone, I dont have a job, the only hobbies I have are watching TV series, playing a mobile phone game untill I get bored of it and get high. These are not hobbies that I enjoy, just to waste the time.

Please give me some tips guys, how can I have that energy and that sense of responsability? How do you guys get disciplined?",NeStyEE12,2,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6vkko/overcoming_depression/
"schools gonna be over in a month, I'm failing, and my mom wont stop yelling at me about it","ive been failing since the start of the pandemic, and I think I'm giving up. but my mom wont stop yelling at me about it. shes yelled at me everyday this week. i think my view of her has permanently changed. she prides herself on being a cool mom because she never made me do anything, no chores, after school activities, stuff like that. now I have no skills, I'm very unmotivated, and Im always so anxious when i have to try new things. that's probably because the one time she actually made me try something, it was something i hated so much i sobbed every night about how i didn't want to do it anymore. now whenever she yells at me she brings up how she never makes me do anything, so why cant i just do school? honestly, i think shes a really shitty parent. she constantly makes these empty threats of how shes gonna delete all of my social media apps and get rid of all the things i waste time on, but shes never actually done anything. i cant actually remember a time when shes actually punished me. its always just yelling and screaming empty threats at me. shes threatened to get rid of all my things more times then i can count so i really don't know what shes expecting. at this point i want her to punish me. i don't know why. i just want her to actually go through with it. maybe that's why I'm giving up. maybe i just want to push her to the point she actually punishes me.

i cant stand living with her anymore. i used to never close my bedroom door because i was fine with people. now i always have it closed because i don't want to be around her. everytime she opens it though, because my dog wants to be near me. but it just makes me feel like there's a hundred-pound silver back gorilla outside of my room and shes opening the door so it can get in. i never really relax, and when i do, i constantly feel on edge. even if I'm doing nothing wrong and just relaxing when i have free time, if she comes in i feel terrified. 

for the past year or so, I've been sleeping ""on guard"". whenever someone is too loud, or something lightly touches me, i instantly wake up and sit up straight. my moms been saying ""i sleep like that because i lived with y crazy abusive dad, why are you like that???"" GEE I WONDER WHY IM LIKE THAT.

sometimes, when she finds out Im missing something in school, shell bust into my room like a bat out of hell and just start yelling at me. i don't know what to do anymore. i just don't have any motivation. i feel like a nuke could be dropped outside my apart and id just say ""meh"" at this point. i just don't care about anything anymore, and all her yelling isn't helping. i always feel stressed. even when I'm asleep i feel so on edge. i fucking hate it here. i hate everyone. 

i remember i used to be so nice, and id go out of my way to help people. now I'm... this. I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't care anymore. i got into one of the best highschool in my state and I'm flunking out of it. i don't know what to do anymore I'm just sick of being alive.

Why my head is dark lonely place.,"Last night I had a dream. In the dream, I was in this really dark place, where there was no light at all. I had a Torchlight with me and I was trying to get somewhere. I felt some sort of thing waiting for me there in that darkness trying to get after me. Then I woke up. 

Last few days, I've tried everything I can think of to feel better but I can't seem to stop this deep urge to end my life. With each passing day, it is getting stronger.  Somehow, I feel there is still some sort of hope in me that stops me from doing it, or maybe the fear of ending in the dark place as I dreamed of last night.  

I do not want to feel this way or be this way but I am. I am good at pretending everything is alright, but my own mind is eating me from inside. There are moments when I forget this but the temptation to end my life is getting more intense these days.  

I am just so lost and I don't even know why.

I am doing my best but I am still unable to be at peace much feel happiness.,"In the past few years I have done just about everything I can think of to be content and happy from time to time. I quit smoking and drinking entirely, sober for 2 1/2 years. I have taken much better care of my health, doing regular exercise and eating healthy, even dieted down from 330 lbs to 190 lbs. I don't waste time on video games at all anymore either. I have been able to vastly improve my work ethic and am now making almost twice as much income at a better job. The upside to all of this is that I suffer a lot less pain and uncertainty which is something. However I have only found it harder to feel positive feeling of any kind or measure. Peace, relaxation, happiness, sexual desire, and love are all notably absent for dry spells that now last days at a time.  I no longer have any enthusiasm for socializing, daily ""how are you doing"" everyone gives me is instantly frustrating. Every topic of conversation feels worn out and like a waste of breath. Only thing I look forward to is my next meal and due to my commitment to not suffer the effects of obesity again I struggle to enjoy that now too as the meal will either leave me wanting if it is done healthily or it will make me anxious/angry if it was junk/overeating.  

The most startling thing for me however were my changes in attitude towards video games and death. I got really tired of not  being happy so I decided to play a video game even though in the past I would become so obsessed with playing them that I wouldn't be able to function well in any other part of life. After about fifteen minutes I realized I had even lost all interest in what was once my obsession. In the past the main reasons I didn't kill myself was cause I didn't want to miss out on the joys of life and I feared the notion of nonexistence. Now that life has just become a constant effort to avoid suffering as much as I can, and nothing else, death has just sort of become the ultimate fix to the problem with no real downside beyond having to brave the point of no return.

world makes no sense  
first everybody will hate you just because you are as you are,as you were born (I DIDN\`T CHOOSE IT why the fuck should i apologise?!?!?!??!), and when they break you, when they reach their goal, then they will hate you twice as much. Because everybody hates insecure, unconfident, quiet, 'negative' people, 'emotional vampires' how they call and people who are not like them, who don\`t talk non-stop about stupid bs and don\`t constantly pretend to  look cool, interesting and funny (who is actually normal unlike them)  FROM BEGINNING, SINCE CHILDHOOD, it runs in their blood (YES they do, don\`t deceive yourself). After what they will *kindly* provide you various *helpful* articles such as 'how to deal with social anxiety', 'how to gain self-confidence', 'why you think everybody hates you', 'how to deal with suicidal thoughts' and at the same time write that such people 'don\`t live their lives and don\`t let others to', 'don\`t approach to them, you don\`t need them in your company' etc. Fucking hypocrites.  


What i am leading to. My theory is getting more and more confirmations with each day. It lies in the fact that psychologists (and people who agree with them) are wrong, all they do is trying to calm down with lies, and i and people like me are right, social anxiety, depression, self hatred and all negative thoughts REFLECT REALITY, answer for all these questions and negative judgments concerning you and attitude of people towards you here from reddit, from quora and other similar sites, from sites for psychological help is YES YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Yes, no one wants you around; no one neither wants you nor needs you; you are always unwanted, outsider; you only disturb and annoy everyone; everyone hates you, doesn\`t want you alive; everyone constantly looks for an opportunity to laugh at you; everyone looks down on you; everyone doesn\`t 'touch' you because/until they have other things to waste energy for; everyone hates weak people and losers; same case with negative thoughts concerning yourself. This is what reality seems to be, just try to google something like 'why people hate insecure people'   


I have other theory according to which - yes it\`s very not fair - people by themselves have the property to feel 'vibes' outgoing from person, and if he is not sociable/talkative (what is the right word) they will notice it and avoid him (not approach); negative thoughts are (for all that) exaggerated, situation is getting worse with lack of social experience (and it is 'snowballing'); and self fulfilling prophecy is real; so we are all just people who are very unlucky for people (lack of good and excess of bad) and conditions to born and grow. Anyway i feel like all these psychological articles don\`t tell the WHOLE truth and miss very important points(things?) because real situation is much more cruel than they describe. I can say for sure that if the first theory isn\`t true then the second is.   
What are your thoughts about it? As everyone like me i just seek the truth

The package and the hole,"(This is not a confession, nor mine. I am simply curious what people might think about somebody who wrote this.)
I spent years of my life, my primary, my secondary; dreaming and conceptually asking for a lie. The few things that gave me happiness were nothing more than little packages that promised on their surface to give me that which I had not had for most of my life as a student. As soon as I opened these packages I realized all the disgusting things they had inside, it was not only the same indifference, ignorance and impurity that I had tried to disregard throughout my life, but also, it was the celebration and appreciation of all these things I had hated. The worst of the case is that I had asked for that miserable package and I do not know if it was out of fear or the lack of interest with which I had become used to living my days that I did not open the door to receive it until what it contained was irretrievably expired. I wonder if in the future it will be for me, as for so many people that once time passes and the contents of the package are fermented in a substance that causes them the same illusion of happiness that my dreams of the future caused me, that I will finally appreciate the false happiness brought by the pleasant lie that temporarily fills that very hole in which we will end up. The same hole that has been my home for a long time, where I have found some tranquility and calm, this hole has the name of loneliness. It is easier to hide in the darkness of this hole where my dreams and fantasies are perfect than to go outside where imperfections are so revered. Once in a while like a diver whose oxygen tank runs out, I would go outside to breathe, but when I did I was naturally so disappointed that I dug that hole more and more. I isolated myself to such an extent that those who originally saw me dig my hole with indifference, now whispered to each other and began to mock that lonely miserable digging his hole. It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don't like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?",EquivalentWest5678,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6uqkr/the_package_and_the_hole/
"I finally got off my meds, what is your best advice for living with depression medication free?","Hey everyone. 

I've been taking various anti depressants throughout my life until I finally got stuck on venlafaxine. I was unable to get off of it for such a long time (nasty withdrawals) but I'm finally free of it!

It's been about a month without them, and the depressive feeling and suicidal thoughts are getting heavy, but I don't want to depend on medication for the rest of my life (personal choice). 

Do you have any advice on how to best (naturally) alleviate the depression? 

Side note, I know working out is one of the best things, which I don't do often, but if you really feel that's the best option, please let me know!)

Also therapy isn't an option

Same thing with a girlfriend, it's been a while since i had one, like 5 years, i have tried getting another but it just never works and im tired of it, probably heartbroken but im just not interested in that anymore, i wish i had one, i miss all the hugs and cuddles and all of that stuff but yeah I've tried and it's not working so im gonna stop trying and focus on something else

But yeah i get it, i should be doing all that stuff, i should be living my life and im too young to focus on boring stuff, but i really have no idea where to search for new friends and possibly a girlfriend, i have tried tinder and dating apps but again it never really worked so i stopped doing it and i don't think im going there again, also im not in optimal mental/physical condition to do that i think there's more important things to fix",brian890_,3,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6stzi/my_therapist_tells_me_that_i_need_new_friends_and/

"FeelsBadMan (no kidding, my very first post)","Hi everyone. Well, i was trying to stay away from social networks, but i guess, i have no choice. Especially with all this pandemic situation and lockdowns. Anyway, i was lurking here and there on Reddit (mostly nsfw stuff to cheer myself up) from time to time, so creating account was just matter of time.

I have a depression for more than 6 years (i'm in my mid 20's), sometimes it gets really tough, sometimes it's bereable. I was fighting it myself, with my family, with psychologist and medicaments. Meds really helped a lot (i even began getting second degree, i'd never thought that i'd have energy for this). But meds aren't the solution, luckily, i managed to stop taking them, but depression still keeps coming back.

Psychologist said that i need hobbies, friends and gf. Well, hobbies should be fine, because my baking and cooking skills allow me to make hand-made presents like cakes and sweets and i get requests from my family the year ahead; also i like videogaming, i have small collection of 1.5k games on different platforms; and i don't mention traditional simple hobbies like listening music, reading books etc. Problem with friends and gf. I have none. Never had gf.

**Question(in case you don't want to read my wall of text): Do you really need gf/bf and how it can help or how it affects your life?** I remember when my psychologist was giving me different tests (dumb tests to be honest, not a big fan of psychologists and their books, real life =/= book), one of her first questions was about my gf. Maybe psychologist saw/found something important that i didn't.

Back into this shit again,"Right when I thought I beat this, when I started feeling confident about myself, and had dreams, goals and motivation... Somehow I fell again, diagnosed with depression and on medication. 

I don't even know what's going on anymore, there is no reason for me to be depressed, I don't understand why my head is going against me, but it's happening and I feel miserable, useless and hopeless about this will ever reach an end unless I do it for myself, cut the little that is left of me and stop this suffering.

I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go. Everytime I fall into this, the already little hope I have to eventually beat this fades a bit more, and it's almost completely gone. I don't have the force to cry, it's just emptiness inside me, but it feels so heavy...

Extremely depressed and need help (bipolar),"Hey guys I just want to start by saying I have bipolar and take a good combination of medication (lamotrigine, seroquel &amp; recently a sleeping pill) for night as I have been getting zero sleep. The pills do work good for alot of things but lately I have been getting anxiety from morning to night. Every single thing said to me I get extreme anxiety to the point of getting sick. Someone could say something and I then take it the wrong way because of anxiety. I'm constantly paranoid during conversations. I have lost two siblings in the past and now constantly think about death (what if my husband dies) for example but every second of everyday.

Thinking about death is literally constant to the point where sometimes I hold my head in my hands and start crying and just start saying I can't live anymore maybe I'm just not meant for earth. I know this probably sounds maybe like I'm trying to find pity but I really don't I have been suffering so bad. If someone yawns infront of me my head will think for an hour ""did they yawn because their bored of being around me?"" It's so exhausting.

I have been so severely concerned with death that I constantly pray that I will die before my husband because I couldn't go on without my best friend. I don't really have any family as much and as I'm writing this the anxiety is there. I've started feeling the comfort in death with myself. I'll start daydreaming about how warm and fuzzy the thought of dying would be. Just blanking out, everything goes black and boom my suffering is gone. I do feel selfish as I know my husband would suffer if I did anything. 

I sleep all day for 8 hours and have no energy to eat. No energy to clean no energy for nothing. When I'm asleep I have no thoughts of anxiety and it feels so cozy. I used to always be on top of everything cleaning the house beautifully. Eating throughout the day normally. I used to be obsessed with music as it makes me feel so good but I turn the music on then 5 minutes later shut it off because lack of motivation. I'm up staring at the wall and just lay there thinking what if my husband dies. Used to love video games now rather lay in bed.

My legs feel so heavy to do anything. Of course there's better days but less than before. I used to never get chest pain but now when I get anxiety which is constantly my chest hurts and I start breathing heavily until the anxiety slows down. I don't know what to do at this point. My doctor sent a referral for a psychiatrist but it's been months with no call and I don't know how to cope. I cry and cry and cry saying I can't do this anymore. I used to have confidence but now feel like a burden to everyone like oh here I go again having a breakdown. I feel bad for everyone around me. When I do listen to music it's now always depressing music which seems to help me. I used to love eating but now my husband says I barely touch my food. I never knew that you could feel anxiety with every word, every thought and every action, 24 hours a day.",SuziMary03,24,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6g81d/extremely_depressed_and_need_help_bipolar/

And then my friend says:

“No she won’t.”

“But it will be the most dominant part of you. Think of your body - if you break your shoulder, even after it heals, it’ll be tender. It will be a sore spot. You will be careful with it. There will be a gentleness when you care for it. If you crack a rib, laughing will hurt and, even after there is no longer a fracture, you will still laugh, but only lighter.

Sadness vs Depression,"Tonight I had a massive realisation that I think completely changes my feelings on my condition. I have a self destructive tendency where I like to make myself more depressed when I'm already depressed (which I think a lot of people can relate to). For example I'll listen to sad music. I was always confused as to why I felt like I found comfort in this. I think that I try to make myself feel sad, because my mind has an urge to let these sad feelings out. However, since I'm numbed out by meds, I can't let them out, making me feel even more depressed. I think there is a fine line between sadness and depression, and they can be hard to tell apart. I always thought I was making myself sad, but I was actually making myself depressed (I believe these are different emotions). I have this insane urge to let my sadness out, an indescribable burning desire it's like a black hole in my chest, but I can't do it, which in a sense is even sadder.

Trauma triggering my depression.,"When I was 20, I moved back home after breaking up with my ex for the millionth time, not knowing I was pregnant at the time. He was manipulative, cheated on me numerous times, mentally and emotionally abusive. I wanted to believe he would change when our daughter was born (I didn’t get pregnant to salvage our relationship) but there was no changing him. He was who he was, and there was no trying to get through to him.

After our daughter was born, we visited him every other weekend (he lived 1.5 hours away from the city) thinking they would eventually bond or he would eventually see our family needs to be together. Even that didn’t change him. After my daughter turned 1, I stopped hearing from him. He eventually found someone new and had two kids with her and went on to marry her. I knew it’d be me and my daughter against the world.

Fast forward to today. I’m 30 and pregnant again with my new boyfriend and he’s the opposite of what my ex is. He’s an amazing man, doesn’t lie, doesn’t cheat, treats me like a queen, treats my daughter as his own. But I am so incredibly traumatized by what my ex had put me through during my pregnancy, I’m deathly afraid to be hurt again and I’m making matters worse by thinking the worst.

I was diagnosed with depression and mild anxiety in 2016. Meds helped until I was okay on my own. I’ve researched that depression can get worse during pregnancy and I tried going back on meds, but they make me sicker than normal pregnancy nausea. I feel myself spiraling and replaying the traumatizing first pregnancy over and over again. My boyfriend doesn’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Thought I was at rock bottom and couldn't get worse... I was wrong,"It feels like everyone around me is just going about their lives and I'm struggling to keep up. A couple of months ago I got this work-from-home job and it felt like maybe it would be a good start to get my life back together again slowly. Now, whenever I start my shift I just dread it so much that I almost start to spiral. I'm in a relationship with a guy who loves me but I feel like I just can't be there for him, he deserves better, not someone who is broken and wasting their time.

What if after all of that I still don't find what I'm hoping to find? Then I'll be unemployed, without a relationship, and doing nothing with my life. 

The easy thing would be to just keep everything as-is and work on myself on the side but I can't do that. It feels like too much for me. I'm on meds, I go to therapy weekly, I try my best but it's never enough. I wish someone could just tell me what the right decision would be but it's not that simple.

The worst part is I don’t have an answer......,"27M soon to be 28 and for the 1st time in my life I can honestly say I’ve never been so lost in my life before. Idk how to even starts this because who cares right?

When I was 18 I graduated high school and didn’t have a clue what to doI ended up partying a lot till I was 20 and then grew out of it. Still didn’t know what to do so I just got into construction. Felt like I was doing something because ever company I worked for promised to “teach me the trade”, and I tried just about every field. Weather it was Roofing, Brick Mason, Landscaping, etc. I even tried some factory work and meat cutting, nobody kept their promises. So I decided to put myself in welding school. 

I love welding! It felt right. A lot of people just see the hard work assuming it’s a bad trade but it’s actually really relaxing. I was doing really well, top of my class, and then the pandemic struck. The degree is two years and I only had two more semesters to go. So when I found out the school was shutting down I was crushed. Mainly because I suffer from Crohn’s disease. It an autoimmune disorder so I had to stay in doors. It was a difficult decision. School or  health? Future or present? I choose me. 

Long story short it’s been a year sense I was in school and I feel left behind. School opened back up but I couldn’t go. I tired doing online classes just to keep my grant but because I couldn’t work I couldn’t pay the wifi bill and I got dropped. I was gonna use the extra money from my grant to pay it but it didn’t come in time before they cut off the wifi. By time I actually got the extra money from school the water/gas was off and the electric company was threatening to turn it off. As you can guess I use that money for the bills and groceries. Now I have to pay the school back before I can even sign up for school. I haven’t been able to find work. Granted I’ve  been looking in the Welding industry, but for the past few months I can’t find any work in any field. The stimulus checks were a great help.....at paying over due bills.

A bird and his dream of salvation..,"They say life is a wonderful journey, yet a painful one too. Sadly, I saw the latter more than the former.

I lived my whole life yearning for salvation. Once I were a religious guy, prayed god to cure me from an illness I did not yet understand or comprehend; being homosexual. Now I’m an adult, now I accept my self, but the bird inside is still trapped.

Trapped in a marvelous cage; a cage that regenerates its bars from the bird’s flesh and bone. Every time the young bird cries, it sheds a feather, and his body loses a bone. Finally the little one became a ghost in his own mind palace, after the physical form had completely vanished.

One day the bird said: “that’s enough!”. he stood on an imaginary legs, and ripped the cage apart, restored few of the stolen bones and flesh. The bird came to a realization: This cage is eternal, so I need to adapt.

And then he decided to replace all the bright – yet falling – feathers, with sheets of hard, solid metal; a metal found in his parents’ nest, the same metal they used to make him his lovely, cozy cage.

The bird became tough, resilient, and feared. But he has lost his vocals.

Words hit the tip of his tongue every single time, but something prevents them from getting out, an obligatory mechanism of being safe: SILENCE.

Mama and Baba bird became proud of the little one, embracing him with expectations and narcissistic love. Eventually, the little one became unaware of the misery eating his core, not finding a way to stop the tears pouring holes in his rusty metal wings.

Will the bird find salvation? Will I find salvation?

Maybe the bird needs his wings a little longer, if he got exposed, the flames of patriarchy love will embrace his heart with agony even more.",Smsm1998,3,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6ro7c/a_bird_and_his_dream_of_salvation/
I tried to kill myself today,"No planning, nothing peticularily bad happened, I just really felt like I wanted to die

Hate my life... whats the point anymore.. I'm never going to have a family.,"I  don't know what to do anymore... I'm just so broken I don't know what  to do. Every part of me hurts...every part of me wishes everything would  just end. But I don't want to die. I just want to be happy.

I've  been depressed for well over 10 years. It wasn't until maybe 4 years  ago I was actually diagnosed. I've been on and off so many different  medications it feels like nothing is ever going to work. I've considered  putting myself in the hospital, but that would mean disclosing the  level of my depression to my parents, and I can't do that to them. Not  only can I not handle them worry about me, but I sure can't handle the  constant calls I will get because of it.

Anyways...I  suppose I should tell my story. Part of it anyways. This happened over the past few months and I honestly am starting to question my sanity.  Like I said before, I've been depressed for years. I haven't had a girlfriend in more than 4 years and I haven't had physical relations in over 9 years now. I've been on so many different dating sites and dating  apps I can't keep track of them. But I still try them...because I just  want to find a family. It's degrading and demotivating getting 1 match  every few weeks and then maybe 1 out of 10 people will actually respond.  I used up my freebie swipes on Tinder, Ok Cupid, Bumble, POF, and Hinge  daily for 3 solid months. No hits, nothing. 

Then,  out of the blue this girl messages me on POF. We hadn't even matched.  She was pretty, she was funny, she was pretty amazing. We hit it off.  For the first time in ages I had hope. I was enjoying things again. She  was nervous about meeting with Covid and a few other personal things so  it took a month to get to the point were we were ready for our first  date. It was quickly approaching and I was so excited. I had  reservations at a local restaurant, and everything planned out.

The  day before our date, she disappears off my match list on POF. I panic  and freak out... immediately a wave of depression hit my like a wall.  That voice in the back of the head telling me how useless and worthless I  was cranked itself up to 11. I survived and it took a week...but I got  back online and started swiping again. It was hard..incredibly hard. I  hated swiping, and every person I looked at was a reminder that she was  gone.

But then I found her again. I  quickly messaged her and asked her what happened. To my surprise she  replies. She had apparently reached out to my real number (I had given  it to her previously for the date) and typed my number wrong. The person  on the other end apparently had some not very nice things to say...  Thinking it was me, she blocked me. Anyways we get it sorted and  rescheduled our date for the following weekend.

Two  days before, she comes down with Covid. Yikes. We reschedule for a few  weeks later once she's better. Cool.. not the best of luck so far, but  seems reasonable I guess.

At this  point we started talking on the phone nightly. For hours. Seriously. 2\~3  hours a night for the entire time she was sick. I fell for her hard.  She was amazing and I felt like I could tell her anything. Out date was  fast approaching and I was again getting super excited.

The  day before the date roles around and she tells me she's going over to  her friends place. She doesn't call me that night. The next morning she  texts me saying she had a really rough night. I find out that apparently  her ex BF had shown up after hearing about ""how much of a jerk I was""  (referring of course to the text she had sent to the wrong person). This  ex isn't just any ex, but apparently someone she loved dearly in the  past and felt like 'he was the one that got away'. So anyways, date  canceled. I'm of course thinking things are over before they even  started now. I'm depressed again.. I'm reverting back to my days of  laying in bed for hours because I cant get the motivation to do  anything. Nothing is fun again.

She  tells me she needs some space to work through things.... but that  doesn't work out. We end up on the phone again every night. She tells me  shes working on ending it with her Ex and moving on with her life to be  with me. I'm ecstatic. A week and a half goes by and finally we plan  another date. This is number 3! 3rd times a charm!

The  date gets closer and closer. Two nights before we spend hours on the  phone again talking. Something was up, but I couldn't quite put my  finger on it. I figured it was private and she would tell me when she  was ready. The next night comes around, she tells me shes going over to a  friends again (it's a Friday - this is typical for her). I tell her to  have fun and that I hope we can still chat that night if she's not too  busy. She never calls. I let it go, maybe she fell asleep. Maybe she  lost track of time. I go to sleep for the night.

Then  I get the text. The text that read 'We decided to give it another  shot'. I'm upset, I'm confused. I couldn't figure out what happened. I  didn't even know her ex was going to be there. It's 7:30AM and I'm awake  now. She texts me again, ""I'll call you later. I'm turning off my phone  to sleep because I didn't sleep last night"". And that was that.

6  hours later she texts me. Apparently two days prior she had found one  of my dating profiles that I had forgotten about. Well, rather her  friend had found it and presented it to her. The important thing to note  here is that she had had a previous BF that had had an entire second  life and a family while they were dating. Yep... Hence her anxiety to  meet. Anyways, she had apparently gone to her friends house and her ex  showed up again. They stayed up again talking about ""how much of a jerk I  was."" I apologize profusely. I had no idea that account had been active  all this time. I hadn't gotten any messages or alerts about the  account, I figured I had deleted it. NOPE.

We  spent hours on the phone talking. It took hours to convince her I was  not out dating still. I was still infatuated with her and the thought of  not having her in my life was so painful to think of. But I did it.. We  continued to talk daily on the phone for weeks, until finally we plan a  5th date.

Today was supposed to  be the fifth date. The entire day I spent worrying that something was  going to happen and we wouldn't be able to meet again. Everything was  going smoothly through the day. I text her half hour before our date and  let her know I'm on my way. She sends me a thumbs up. YES! I thought.

I  show up at the parking lot we were going to meet at (we were just going  to go for a walk around a lake). I'm 5 minutes early so I hang out in  my car. 10 minutes pass.. OK she's running a bit late. 15 minutes pass, I  call her. Her phone rings twice and goes to VM. This is where it got  weird. Her voicemail changed. Instead of it saying her name, it was now  just saying her phone number.  I leave a quick message saying I'm there  and am super excited.

20 minutes pass

30 minutes pass

I've now called her 4 times and texted her 3 times. No response. Nothing.

I go home. I write up this message. I cry myself to sleep because I'm going to die alone.

My  best friend is a social worker. I can't tell him any of this. Every  time I try to, he wants to send me to the hospital. I have no one to  talk to. I just quit my job yesterday because my manager was such a  prick I couldn't take it anymore. I thought with her I could make it  through this tough time... but now this. I'm unemployed, family-less,  broke out of my mind, and I have no one. I'm so alone... What is the  point any more? I can't find anything enjoyable. I don't want to see  people. I don't want to move.

"Life keeps getting miserable, I am tired.","Got diagnosed with cancer last year because of which I had to quit working. Few months down the line my savings started quickly evaporating and eventually turned into pennies.

Physically unable to work and desperate for a source of income I withdrew a line of credit made available to me via a credit app. I tried to put that money in stock market, to see if I can earn from trading. I wasn't a newbie in the market but only had experience investing and not trading.

Fast forward today, I'm miserable. There are not many job openings because of the pandemic and I am in debt. 

I don't know what I am gonna do. I wish I never got diagnosed with cancer. Life was pretty okay for me before that and everything started going downhill since. 

In the past few months I have often thought that it would have been better if I didn't make it out alive after the operation or from chemo. While on chemo most of the nights I felt like I may not wake up the next morning. I wish that would have turned true.

I feel like cancer has fucking destroyed my life. I always wonder how great life would have been if I hadn't gotten diagnosed. I'm in my early 20s for fucks sake. No one at this age neither expects or is ready for these things. Yet somehow I ended up in it.

I never thought, I would one day end up in debt. I was pretty great at managing my money. And for someone at my age I had a pretty decent savings as well. Cancer fucking took everything from me and it continues to do so.

Not only the above, but it has fucked me up emotionally. None of my friends understand what was it like for me. Everyone expects me to behave normally or as if it didn't happen. As if everything is okay now that I am cured.

But the truth is it did happened and it fucked me up real bad. I cannot turn a blind eye to it, I cannot live normally after going through the trauma and I don't even feel like living anymore at this point.

It has, eventually rendered me broke and miserable. Something I never imagined in my wildest of thoughts.

Tomorrow will be a month since I lost my mom and I feel dead inside.,"April 08, 04:24 AM - I received a call at midnight that my mother breathed her last. Upon hearing this I went numb and dead inside. I didn’t know how to react. How does one react to a news like this? 

I lost my father almost 23 years ago and my mother was my world. More often than not in my existence of 30 years on earth, I have struggled to meet eye to eye with my mother, and yet it feels like someone has ripped my heart out completely. She WAS my place of love, rage, anger, pain - she was my place to complain and that’s probably the most propelling beauty of a mother-daughter relationship - she was my place of everything. 

The insurmountable pain in my heart and the grief is too very real to overcome. I feel like I can’t breathe. She was suffering from third stage of cancer, COPD, and slowly her organ shut down. I get calls and messages from people everyday telling me to be strong. But all I want to do is shout at the top of my lungs and telling them that “I don’t want to be strong. I want to be vulnerable and I want to cry” but I cannot because I feel dead inside.

Why doesn’t society normalise grieving even when it says it does? Why does it see being vulnerable even at the worst moments as the sign of weakness? I cannot sleep at night, I cannot cry, and often it is so hard to breathe. My heart aches so much but those damn tears just won’t come. I feel like my life has no purpose and I am alone in this world and that feeling is so scary that I have panic attacks almost everyday. 

I am a 30-year old orphan battling a domestic violence case against my estranged husband and although I have friends and relatives, it is just not the same. It’s those little things that my mom did, even as simple as a phone call everyday to ask me if I have eaten that I terribly miss. 

My father committed suicide and I have been suicidal prone and attempted many times in the past. And with mom gone, I feel like my life has no meaning, no purpose and it is just so hard to carry on. And the worst part is, I don’t even know how to grieve. The sleeplessness, the depression, the anxiety is killing me slowly. 

I have been strong all my life, through my father’s death, through childhood sexual abuses, through getting raped, through a bad marriage and domestic violence, through a heart attack at just 29, and through battling COVID in a hospital - but I can no longer have the strength to carry on. 

I just have no hope left in me...",Elle_rose_19,1,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6vyp6/tomorrow_will_be_a_month_since_i_lost_my_mom_and/
I don’t listen to music anymore.,"Hey guys, my name is Jake (24) let me start off by saying I’ve lost my love for music because of my depression. I’ve been suffering from this for about 4 years now and it’s ruining my life. Back when I was younger, all I would do is listen to music to help get my mind off things. It was my escape, my happy place, something I could use to have fun. I mostly listen (listened) to rap music. Everyone knew me as the “music guy” among all my friends. I used to look up new artists for hours because i just wanted to listen to new music all the time. Also used to make music myself but I’ve lost my interest in that as well. But anyway, I can’t “feel” the music the way I used to it’s honestly freaking me out to the point of myself in tears every time I try and listen to a new song by my favorite artists. I can’t tell if I even like the song or not. Another thing to mention, some songs seem idk loud to me or irritating, idk if my ears are damaged or if my depression is to blame.

I feel like I've screwed it all up.,"For the last few weeks, social media has been both a plus and a minus for me, but especially a minus. I have no friends in real life, since I've always had to move away. I'm 19, living with my parents before I go to college, and I'm failing at keeping my sanity up. I feel like I've exiled, pushed away everyone who cared about me, so now they don't. I've been left out a lot when I was young, nor was I close to anyone emotionally or friends wise. Now whenever I see that happen to me intentionally I just break down and it makes me wanna blame myself for causing that to happen, for causing myself to be left out. I need help, but I have no clue how to get help and how I should keep my mindset high enough. I built this all up, just to tear it all down. I wanna blame them, but I can't. It's all my fault. If I wasn't going through shit, if I wasn't who i was, then maybe things would be different. These are the only friends I've ever been somewhat close to.

I'm human. (At least I'm trying.) And as a human, I'm not always good. I know how bad I am in some aspects, and this consciousness is too depressing. When I try don't think about that, I don't feel quite like myself. I want to remember it. It's too important for me. But I feel so bad then that I'm incapable do anything good to be a slightly better person. That's funny how paradoxical it is.

Honestly, I want to die due to this feeling, but I can't kill myself, because of my sister and mother. I can't kill myself when they're alive. I certainly don't want to hurt them.

It will sound stupid, but I even wanted to start smoking because I would maybe die sooner. And because it's soothing (and I feel anxious all the time). But I can't even smoke because I don't want to support animal testing connected with cigarette production.

The only thing I like to do is writing, but everything I write I instantly hate and destroy.

All in all, I think I'm too weak to living. I deeply admire other people, but I'm also scared of them. I can't stand that cruelty that is so connected with mere existence. My comfort is redeemed by the suffering of others, less fortunate, and I hate living. And it's so unfair. I'm so ungrateful, but I can't help myself. I'm just unable to fulfill my idea of human, and it prevents me from trying at all.",jane7779,1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6vgre/i_guess_im_not_suited_for_life/

I (don't) want to die,"I'm 19 and I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life. I have no purpose. My self-destructive behavior and the crippling numbness I'm enduring is all too much. Between the pressure from my mother of wanting me to success in life, having to decide which college I'm gonna go to and the fact that I'm confused about my own sexuality makes me want to end my life. But the truth is, I don't even know if I really want to die. I think I just don't want to exist anymore. There's a difference. I've thought about killing myself but I never had the courage to do it because I'm afraid to suffer or even feel pain. My mind has taken me to dark places. As silly as it is, I even thought about hiring a hitman to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. I don't think I feel sad. I just feel empty. I mean, I am sad, but mostly I just feel empty. I find myself thinking about committing suicide because I'm going to die eventually so why should I wait for that time when I can end all this suffering now? I think about the cycle of life and I just become even more hesitant to live. I mean what happens even if I survive college? Get a job, get married, have kids and eventually have my marriage fall apart after years of loveless sex and then die. I kind of want to skip all of those things and just be...gone. But like I said, I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. And another thing is, I don't know if I even wanna be in a relationship. I've always known that I don't wanna be with someone. I can't even take care of myself let alone take care of a girlfriend. I guess part of the reason why I'm afraid of commitment is because I'm surrounded by abusive relationships. I always hear my sister and her girlfriend beat up and yell at each other in the next room and when my dad was around, he used to beat me up and my sisters. He never hit mom which is a good thing, I guess. Every time he and my mom got into an argument, he would blame us and punish us. I remember this one time, when I was eight, he got so mad he lifted me up and strangled me. He wasn't a bad father. Only when he was angry. He wasn't a bad husband either, except for when he cheated on my mom which he did more than once. But what I'm feeling now has nothing to do with my terrible childhood. Anyway, some of my friends would tell me to find somebody to love because it helps but I don't think having a girlfriend is gonna fill the void. I don't know what will, but being in a relationship certainly won't fix what's broken inside of me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no one to talk to. My entire family is busy with their own lives. My dad abandoned us when I was ten, my two siblings are dealing with their own shit and even if they weren't, I don't think I can ever open up to them without feeling like I'm being judged and I can't even talk to my mom without her pressuring me to go to college. That's the thing with my mom. She wants things to work out exactly as she planned it. She wants me to finish college so she can have something to brag about. I have two siblings and I'm the youngest. One of my sisters started college but didn't finish and the other was not interested to study at all. Because I'm the youngest child, the only child she has who might actually have a chance to finish college, she pushes me too hard to the point that the pressure is too much to handle. It's like she doesn't care about what I want. The responsibility of going to college is tethered to me, and I don't have a choice. Don't get me wrong, my mom loves me. God knows I'm not a perfect son. I did a lot of shitty things to her in the past and she forgave no matter how fucked up my wrongdoings were. That's why I also think I'm obligated to finish college, to repay her for the things I've done. I have a best friend who I think I rely on too much. The sad part is, I don't think he considers me as his best friend because he's got other friends who he has known for years and it's hard to comepete with that, but it's okay. I've got other friends who I can try to talk to but I don't think they'll understand what I'm going through because they're so happy and contented with their lives. Unlike me. I'd like to be that type of person who doesn't give a shit what anyone thinks but unfortunately, I do. Some of my friends can sense that something's off about me. My best friend notices that my vibe's not right. I don't know if I want to tell them about my constant loss of will to live. I don't know if I'm willing to open up to them. I don't know if I want to be emotionally naked in front of anyone, if I'm being honest. I always jump to conclusions and think that if I do open up to them, they would just think that I'm fishing for attention by acting sad. Most of my friends know exactly they want to do with their lives. I guess I do too, (I want to be an author or a film director) but with my lack of confidence, I don't think I'm gonna get there. I wouldn't say I'm dumb and I would never call myself a genius in a million years either. I know things but it's not enough. I think I'm too stupid for college. That's one of the reasons why choosing a school is a lot of pressure for me. I have no idea if I'm just plain stupid or if I have a learning disability. Because I don't think my brain is wired correctly. This isn't normal.

I thought I hit rock bottom years ago, when I was bullied back in high school. I skipped school for a whole month because I didn't want to face my bullies. I got picked on, hit, laughed at and humiliated. I was beaten up physically and emotionally and it scarred me for life. Because of that trauma, my friends can't even hit me jokingly without looking like a pussy. But I never thought about killing myself then. And it makes me wonder if I prefer the constant embarrassment and humiliation I felt back then than what I'm feeling now. I guess I've always been broken but I didn't realize it until a couple of months ago. I try to be happy and I guess I am when I'm surrounded by my friends but when they're gone and I'm all by myself, I'm back to being miserable.

Sometimes, I think about hooking up with random people to temporarily fill the void and numb the pain because I don't wanna be left alone with my own thoughts. But that shit won't last for long. The thing is, I've always been an introvert. I hate being around people I don't know. But these days, I don't wanna be alone because I'm scared of my myself. I loathe myself. I hate me and the fucked up bit is I can't get away from me. I can never escape myself. Funny how I try to convince me that I love myself but the truth is, I don't. It fascinates me how people can love themselves and mean it. Meamwhile, I hate the person I've become. I hate being alone with myself because the thoughts that I have are crushing me. I don't want to feel this way but at the same time, I know I'm responsible because I'm the one who creates my own thoughts. I'm also afraid that my constant need for distraction comes off as desperation for attention toward my friends, who I'd ask to hang out with every once in a while to keep me off my thoughts even though I know they have their own lives that doesn't revolve around me. I'm afraid of losing my closest friends and my best friend. I can feel them slipping away. I'm afraid of myself for wanting to kill myself. I'm afraid of a lot of things. I just wish someone had the answer to tell me what to do because my mind is not in the right place. I want it to stop. I don't necessarily want to die, I just don't want to exist.

I don't know what part of me is real anymore.,"I say this because I've been able to emotionally manipulate myself for at least 3 years. In fifth grade, I reverse psychologied myself into a crush that I was struggling to get over in eighth grade, and maybe I'm just another case of confirmation bias, but there's a lot more less significant incidents that also hint towards my manipulation like this, I just can't pick out what they are (it's all a bit jumbled, as it tends to be).

March of last year, I got asked out by someone. It took me a few days because _I didn't know_ whether or I liked them or not, so I couldn't answer. I ended up saying yes, and we're still together now. I'm... still pretty young, not yet college age. 

This is my first relationship, and I've been riddled with doubt from the moment I said yes, because what if I was lying to myself and said yes for their benefit? What if it's another case of me forcing myself to have feelings for this person because I don't want to hurt them? Recently, I've been dreading any chance of seeing them, but the moment I do it's like I've never had a single doubt and it doesn't make sense. It just doesn't, and it scares me. What if this yearlong relationship was based on a lie? 

How do I tell them that I've been lying to them, and lying to myself, and that we should've never been together in the first place?

Fuck puberty, for sending me into this emotional whirlwind, and fuck emotions, because I don't know what to do with them, I don't know which ones are real, and they could ruin me if I don't figure this out.

Constantly feeling crap about myself,"I've been feeling incredibly shit about myself since last September and I am struggling to understand how I can keep going on like this. Lockdown kicked this all off for me as I've never experienced anything like this in my life before. Last year I was furloughed from April to July and I was perfectly fine during that, went back to work in August then come September that's when I started to feel like this.

As I was out of normal routine and not able to do anything other than work and best home, I found myself alone with my thoughts going over what I have done with the soon to be 28 years of my life. And I've pretty much hate myself for how I've led it so far.

I was bullied all the way through school to the point of near suicide, messed up my relationships with the only 2 girlfriends I've had in my life and have been single since I was 14 with no luck since, wasted my 2 years at college doing a music course that I'd never use for a career, went into the Army at 19 only to fuck my knees up and come out at the age of 20 halfway through trade training, spent 2 years working a dead end job and now working a current job that I started as an apprentice but now stuck there as I haven't got the skills or experience to go elsewhere.

Still living with my parents at my age and I can't afford to move out and get my own place, I have no friends of my own or any social circles, I'm too shy, have an introverted personality and suffer from social anxiety which is preventing me from making new friends and getting into a relationship with anyone.

Every day since September, I keep thinking about my life over and over again and ever day I have being bringing myself to tears because of it. I just hate myself so much and don't worthy of anything including my life.",Black_prince_93,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6ru9q/constantly_feeling_crap_about_myself/
In The Woods,"I sit on this detritus, alas, in a place from whence body and soul are adrift in machine mediums that travel with them. The only defense remains in the form of said twain bodies. They feel it now, taking hold and letting go, leaving me with the vestiges of pre-memory, now unbound and finally concepted within my mind. As I feel this now, the overwhelming sensations of nature, produces machine air defense that fucks me with self existentialism. Laughing and crying had strange effects of catharticism, but as time's fleeting, nay, apathetic consumption of my fears and nihilistic desires. Do I sit here with the interbound effects of machine upon karma, afflicts me with the currency in thought. Trite are the desires of normality. Keeping oneself beyond this reality is the bear at birth. I've been conditioned to veil sorrow in the hopes of social conformity, yet they ask why I'm not faining life, rather, I feign it. Life is the gift of bereavement as it must return to its former.

When you want to be better, when you wanna do better but you can't. This past few months I feel like I'm trapped in a loophole of negative energy. I am always tired even though I get enough sleep.

Sometimes cry for no reason, but there are days that I don't feel anything. Empty. 

And what's worse is I can't even tell this to my family or my friends because I'm afraid of how they will react. I don't know if they can absorb the fact that I'm not mentally stable.

Trying to keep my head above water,I’ve been dealing with depression that got worse postpartum last year and with the pandemic and a pretty wild baby I’ve been struggling to keep it together. I’m fine 2 1/2 weeks out of the month but a good week and a half I want to die. It’s mainly my hormones affecting it so badly. Anyways I recently started confiding in my husband as a safe space but I’m starting to really feel like it’s not. It started during sex about a week ago he made a comment about how I’m not “whining and crying now” and at the time it didn’t bother me but last night I couldn’t stop crying over it. I want to talk to him about it but also feel like it may not go over well. Also he said that he recently talked about my issues but didn’t go into details about what and who and it’s driving me crazy. Half the time I clearly bury my head in the sand and it’s been so hard. My life is good but I can’t stop feeling like this. Antidepressants didn’t work well and the side effects were too much on me. Any advice/thoughts/help would be appreciated. I don’t feel like I’m full on going to end myself right now but I’m so tired of sinking so low and only resisting because my kids need their mom! I just don’t know what to do and every time I talk to anyone I don’t think they understand the depth of pain that I’m feeling inside. I always get stupid comments about how good I have it and it could be worse. I know this but it’s not something I can control and I absolutely hate how this is ravaging my life!

I'm feeling kind of lost...,"I'm honestly dumbfounded every time I remember the week I planned to end it all.

The details are engraved into my memories, because what happened to me is gonna make me sound completely crazy.

please don't judge me, I'm genuinely confused about this part of my life, I cry when I try to make sense of it. I really need this off my shoulders... I advise you not to read my story if you are sensitive to anything related to suicide. Nothing to depict, but it's brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started when my ex had left me, almost 3 years ago. I did nothing but look down on myself for treating him badly. I hurt him in ways I never intended, and I was ready to accept my fate to avoid further destruction. All my life till that point, I was nothing but an anchor on anyone I came across.    
I had planned to starve and dehydrate myself the week of Spring Break, 2018. 

But one night, maybe a few days before Thursday(the day I decided), I closed my eyes and pleaded in my own thoughts for someone to save me. I wanted a sign of hope, a sign that I had a future ahead of me, a sign that at least one person cared about me. And the night before Thursday, my ex's grandma had texted me to check up on me.

I was completely in shock, as I never pleaded out loud or to anyone. I never shared my plans, and even made sure nobody could've found out. I never wrote it down or typed it anywhere. Yet, my pleads got somewhere somehow. 

She never texted me up until that point. 

I keep running it over and over in my head, wondering if I somehow spilled my plans to someone. At some point I convinced myself that I texted someone about it, cause it's the only thing that makes sense. I thought that somehow, maybe religion was real... The way I pleaded, seemed like a prayer. My ex's grandma was religious. Theoretically, those dots connect. But realistically, it makes no sense. Mainly cause I'm just not religious. Maybe she simply cared about me...something I shouldn't deny..

I feel a lot better getting that out somewhere.

Depression as an Abaissement du niveau mental and how to cope with it .,"The cause of the depression might be due to something repressed drawing the mental energy form conscious and lowering the cognitive functions , causing an introversion of the libido (mental energy) .

DR Carl Jung the swiss psychiatrist writes :

"" It is a slackening of the tensity of consciousness, which might be compared to a low barometric reading, presaging bad weather. The tonus has given way, and this is felt subjectively as listlessness, moroseness, and depression. One no longer has any wish or courage to face the tasks of the day. One feels like lead, because no part of one's body seems willing to move, and this is due to the fact that one no longer has any disposable energy. This well-known phenomenon corresponds to the primitive's loss of soul.

.... Abaissement du niveau mental can be the result of physical and mental fatigue, bodily illness, violent emotions, and shock, of which the last has a particularly deleterious effect on one's self-assurance. The abaissement always has a restrictive influence on the personality as a whole. ....""CW9

""the future appears hopeless and empty. But what robs Nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is the habit of looking back for something that used to be outside, instead of looking inside, into the depths of the depressive state. This looking back leads to regression and is the first step along that path. Regression is also an involuntary introversion in so far as the past is an object of memory and therefore a psychic content, an endopsychic factor. It is a relapse into the past caused by a depression in the present.

Depression should therefore be regarded as an unconscious compensation whose content must be made conscious if it is to be fully effective. This can only be done by consciously regressing along with the depressive tendency and integrating the memories so activated into the conscious mind—which was what the depression was aiming at in the first place"" Jung CW 5

""My patient was a very clever young man who had been intellectually enlightened as to the cause of his neurosis by a lengthy analysis. However, intellectual understanding made no difference to his depression. In cases of this sort the doctor should spare himself the useless trouble of delving still further into the causality; for, when a more or less exhaustive understanding is of no avail, the discovery of yet another little bit of causality will be of no avail either. The unconscious has simply gained an unassailable ascendency; it wields an attractive force that can invalidate all conscious contents—in other words, it can withdraw libido from the conscious world and thereby produce a “depression,” an abaissement du niveau mental (Janet). But as a result of this we must, according to the law of energy, expect an accumulation of value—i.e., libido—in the unconscious.

Libido can never be apprehended except in a definite form; that is to say, it is identical with fantasy-images. And we can only release it from the grip of the unconscious by bringing up the corresponding fantasy-images. That is why, in a case like this, we give the unconscious a chance to bring its fantasies to the surface. .... It is characteristic of the nature of the unconscious psyche that it is sufficient unto itself and knows no human considerations.

Once a thing has fallen into the unconscious it is retained there, regardless of whether the conscious mind suffers or not. The latter can hunger and freeze, while everything in the unconscious becomes verdant and blossoms.

So at least it appears at first. But when we look deeper, we find that this unconcern of the unconscious has a meaning, indeed a purpose and a goal. There are psychic goals that lie beyond the conscious goals; in fact, they may even be inimical to them. But we find that the unconscious has an inimical or ruthless bearing towards the conscious only when the latter adopts a false or pretentious attitude

...when a fit of depression comes upon him, he must no longer force himself to some kind of work in order to forget, but must accept his depression and give it a hearing. Now this is the direct opposite of succumbing to a mood, which is so typical of neurosis. It is no weakness, no spineless surrender, but a hard achievement, the essence of which consists in keeping your objectivity despite the temptations of the mood, and in making the mood your object, instead of allowing it to become in you the dominating subject.

So the patient must try to get his mood to speak to him; his mood must tell him all about itself and show him through what kind of fantastic analogies it is expressing itself"" Jung CW 7",rakengineer,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6ty5e/depression_as_an_abaissement_du_niveau_mental_and/
Being with someone that has depression,What would you want your partner to do for you? I’m trying to figure out what to do to help my bf of almost 7 years. He recently cheated on me and says he was going through a mental breakdown. I gave him a second chance and honestly he needs real help but no one else cares enough to help him.

I don't know what to do. I'm going to fail most of or all of my classes in uni tomorrow.,"First off, I couldn't give a crap about my university grades. I do not for a second believe that a degree will help me where I'm going. I have some pretty good talents in a field people are still mostly naive about and I have an artistic vision that I believe is pretty strong in another field I want to pursue. Most of the famous and accomplished people in that field/industry I want to work in either didn't finish college or didn't go to it. So, I'm only attending college now for emotional enrichment, emotional independence, and because my father wants me to. That brings me to my next point.

My dad is unfortunately a very conservative, harsh and traditional person. He absolutely reviles his own generations for the sex and lsd. He thinks all democrats are evil communists. He hates gay people and trans people and thinks that gay people should be treated for their disorder ""but the democrats got rid of mental care for these gay people."" 80% of the words that come out of his mouth are disparaging about some type of groups of people. Like ""Oh that girls a slut. Look at those awful tattoos."" or ""these gay retards are blah blah blah."" He's like a toxicity machine but he doesn't realize it because he still believes that I agree with all the batshit insane garbage he spews. Spoiler, I don't. My father hates the world. He hates most people. But I still love him. He's an incredibly hard worker and he's been screwed over so many times in his life that I understand his anger. But it doesn't change the fact that he is an intimidating and slightly manipulative person. I personally think he's an emotionally abusive person but I can't confirm if he falls in that group. 

I didn't want to go to college after high school. High school was the worst 4 years of my life and I wanted to take a year and 2 summers to relax and not deal with any assignments or tests. I wanted to get a job and start making a small amount of money in addition to getting work experience. The last thing in the world that I wanted was to go straight into college after HS but alas that is what happened. However, in college, the first semester at least, I started to feel very happy and non stressed out now that I was about 2 hours away from him. I never had, and still never have, done any type of drugs or had sex. But just the separation and the calm felt so nice. I enjoyed my first semester. And halfway into my second semester, covid hit and everything went online. That's where everything started to fell apart. I have had 3 bad semesters in a row. A year and a half of low grades, barely escaping academic suspension, and covid grade. Now it looks like things will finally be back to in person classes coming this fall.

This semester has been my worst. I haven't done a majority of the work. I have been depressed. I have been ""attending class"" this entire year in this house where he is the only other person. It has taken a toll on me a little bit. I just stopped doing the work. I didn't feel compelled to do it. I then said to myself ""Oh, I'll do the late work tomorrow."" But then late work built up and I got into the headspace that I can't finish the recent late work until I submitted the older late work. But I never did either. Tomorrow's my last day of finals. I have accepted the failure and plan on zeroing out all my grades with Covid grades and starting small next semester. Again, I don't care much for college. I just want to go back to that down again. It's such a nice place and my life was calm away from my dad. I was infact so un stressed that I began losing weight like crazy. I just felt good. Again. I love my father. If he were to die I would be sad. He's been dealt a real shitty hand in life and I want to find a way to be supportive of him but also not actually have to deal with him. Living in a dorm 2 hours away seemed to fit that nice balance.

What I'm leading to is this. I fear what he thinks of me and I fear his intimidating talks with me. I don't want to talk to him about my grades. I just fucking don't. I am actively contemplating faking me grades using various means including editing the html of a page and faking my future schedule. I don't care about my grades. HE DOES. I don't know what to do. And for anyone saying ""Oh just tell him the truth. Parents will understand."" Not this parent. This guy has the sensibilities and expectations of someone from the 1950s. He is not understanding. I don't know if I should still just tell him the truth and endure the most likely angry talk he'll have with me or if I should just lie to him.",ChildTaekoRebel,1,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6tg3l/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_going_to_fail_most_of/

Why are dreams so cruel?,"Finally the moment I’ve been waiting for for three years, there he was with my ring of choice that I told him about before when he asked.

But no, I woke up, in my dead end  life in which I feel like I have a dead end relationship. Same thing day in day out, still being strung along as a girlfriend when I couldn’t care less about the title. It’s not like being a girlfriend matters...it only means “yeah you’re good enough to date and fuck and help with the house, but not good enough to marry.” I’m so tired of hearing “not yet” or “couple more years” when I’m not getting any younger. I have no bigger fear than being strung along and dumped after like 7 years when I’m 30 something. I’m not the prettiest girl either so at least now I’m still kind of young, but then I really won’t have much going for me. Sure I have a career woohoo...but it’s not like I’m getting paid a whole lot at my professional job. It just sucks and I wanted to get this out.

Crippling Inferiority Complex,"For the first time in a long time, I found out that I couldn't move myself out of bed. 

Social media is stupid, it makes you compare yourself with people who seem to have a better life than you. So I deleted most social media but still, even outside of social media, people tend to be doing much better than you. They have better houses, cars, clothes, a relationship, etc. I have none.

Everywhere I go, I could never be in the top 10%. Be it in school, university and competitions. I programmed myself to seek victory at all costs but I'm a sore loser. I struggle to analyze my mistakes and now I'm just tired of failing and losing while everyone else seems successful. I never cry but I'm on the verge of tears. 

As a kid, whenever we played soccer, if the top dog striker didn't come, everyone would cancel the match and not play. Even if I was present, they'd put me as a substitute and sat me on the sidelines, so I was there but not doing anything and not being missed. It was insulting that I was a substitute in name only. Ever since then, I had a grudge for soccer.

I also hold grudges for academics and video games. I suck at them and can't do good. How do I stop holding grudges and learn from my mistakes?

I can't take it anymore. I'm not happy with myself. I want to be better. And I refuse to follow the ""love yourself"" bullshit. Who loves a loser? I don't. I need to do better.

How do I tell my parents my depression?,"Let me get to the point. Since last year, I’ve been tired of pretending that everything was ok. The lack of expressing my actual emotions and just putting on a mask for everyone, really got to me. When school started, I thought I could be new. Welp. More or less. I couldn’t do it. Well it’s May and guess… I’m in my depressed mode more than usual. And well I feel really empty. And instead of keeping this to myself and bottling everything, waiting for my breakdown moments just to let it all out, I decided to act on them (my emotions). For my emptiness, I hug my bf and not care about my surroundings. I zone out pretty often and don’t feel like doing anything nor talking. I just want to be alone or in silence. My best friend doesn’t really understand why but she doesn’t complain when I give hugs. I just directly tell her that I’m sad. So now that every grown up is saying that I’ve “changed” because I made friends….. I can’t hold in my problems anymore. Cuz that's not even close. I don't have friends except for one. I have classmates but we not close enough to be called friends like that you know.  I’m telling parents just to make them understand.

Feeling desolate and unable to find meaning in life.,"Before I explain my situation, I must clarify that I'm not suicidal - never have been. I'm just feeling a bit down and unable to piece myself together.

I have always been an individualist in most activities in my life - never really got used to having people around as I didn't stay in the same place for long periods of time. I was a shy kid, but pretty confident in whatever I was good at.

My social situation slowly changed as I grew up. I started finding comfort in others' company. I liked being challenged, as that boosted my creativity.

In just a span of about 2 years, I broke my shell and formed multiple social circles which, in a way, formed my identity.

Lately however, I have lost my optimism. I have lost most of my social circles, and my interest in my job. Any attempts at making new relationships seems futile due to their fleeting nature. WFH had a net negative impact on my social interactions. The extended working hours really slung me into depression in 2020.  
I eventually quit the job and took up freelance work that pays me just more than what my generously cushy job was offering, but I do not know what I want to do long term.

At best, I feel numb and at worst, I feel like a total imposter in what I do. I planned on having therapy sessions, but that has been thwarted by the increasingly bleak situation created by the pandemic. This just sounds like a mid life crisis in my 20s.

Can I take a break from life please?!,"Literally nothing has gone right today and I feel like I'm being personally attacked left and right. This is on top of already having a head full of thoughts I can barely make sense of as it is. I'm constantly in a state of panic and a state of indifference and it's too much to bear now.

For the last few weeks I've been feeling kind of empty, like I'm bumbling along on autopilot, I just get up, do stuff to get by, go to work and then come home and sleep. I don't have any fun anymore, there's joy in absolutely nothing at the moment. I can be with friends or family and feel completely alone. I feel like I'm always listening to other peoples issues and being there for them and no one seems to listen to me when I need to talk stuff out.

My best friend ditched me for reasons unknown, I put in a lot of effort to keep the friendship going and in the end it felt like a full time job. And then they just disappeared. Things aren't great at work, I feel like everythings just piled on to my shoulders and everyone else seems to have time to stop and chat and play on their phones and if I stop for a minute, I'll be behind on everything. I was due a small get together with friends and family this weekend for my birthday bbq but most people have dropped out of that now so I don't think I'll be doing anything on my birthday, fun!

I stay up super late (it's 3.50am now) and sleep in as late as I'm able, I'm bored with things I used to find so much joy out of, I don't really even wanna be around my friends that much anymore because having to speak to people and fake being happy is so fucking exhausting and bringing me to literal tears.

I just want someone to make time for me, to ask me how I'm doing for a change, to listen to my problems, to actually want to be with me on special occasions like birthdays.

Afraid of success,"I've been with the same company for the past 5 years as a high-functioning depressive. I interviewed well and for the first few years I was on an upward trajectory. My anxiety was overwhelming at the time and my depression worsened after my best friend died. I couldn't handle what life was throwing at me to the point that all I thought about was killing myself. After 2 inpatient stays at a behavioral health facility I moved back with my parents a few months before the pandemic began.

Over the past year I slowly pieced together my sense of self while trying to grow in my job. I'm often embarrassed because I have never been promoted and I'm the most tenured person in my position. There's an opening now for a Team Lead position that I want to apply for, but my fingers are frozen as I write up my application. I'm afraid of success and spent the past 2 years actively trying to stay under the radar because I burned a few professional bridges during my manic state. 

I know that plenty of time has gone by since my last episode, but the guilt and shame still weigh heavily. Right now I'm talking myself out of applying and hoping someone can help me stop spiraling.",Great_Scott_88,2,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6oeb2/afraid_of_success/

Depression if they could only see it,"I recently had a cyst on my breast it was really painful and swollen but I managed two courses of antibiotics and I was ok. The infection cleared.

But I remember the look on my doctor's face when I showed her the wound and she quickly ran over to get an antiseptic bandage and looked my in the eye genuinely concerned and said you poor thing it just have been awfully painful. Oh wow!

I remember feeling anger at that moment.

Anger because if she could see into my head and the depression I'm suffering from as a physical thing her reaction would be much more extreme.

If she could see the mental pain I'm suffering from from depression inside she would have ran out of the room screaming in horror.

We have to suffer this depression in silence and it's much more painful than physical wound. I wish there was some way the doctor's could see depression. And anxiety for that matter.

"Been depressed for so many years that I have no interests. I'm not even sure I'm depressed anymore, but I was for so long that my personality became so ... braindead, it's like I don't have the capacity to have interests anymore. My brain barely reacts to anything, everything is so dull.","That wouldn't be much of a problem, because I'm fine getting my dose of enjoyment the same way I have all my life - watching sitcoms/youtube and browsing the internet. Those are my only ""interests"".

But I have no skills! Because of my lack of interests, because I don't like anything, I never became good at something.

And because of that, even when trying hard for months to find an idea that I could work on and not just be a wageslave working a bad job all my life, I didn't find anything that I would be remotely interested in!

One of my biggest dreams is to learn a skill, to be a master at something after years of work! But I can't do that because of my utter lack of interest in anything. And it's not something you can force, cause I tried forcing it, tried sticking with something I had no interest in, and let me tell you, that doesn't work at all.

I can't even be creative because of this. Thought of maybe writing, or making youtube videos. And I tried so hard, but I just don't like anything. Cause even when reading or watching a funny video, my face doesn't react, I'm so still and unmoved. How can I possibly create something when nothing elicits a response from me?

For Mental Health Awareness,"In 2009, I tried to take my own life. I have gotten help since then, and still see a psychiatrist and psychologist. When the pandemic happened a year ago, I wanted to post something to try and help people cope, but got scared to share how I feel. While these feelings still creep in and some days I just feel like ""what is the point""? so I am going to post what I left for everyone; not to glorify what I tried to do, but because every single time I read this now, I know I have so much to live for. (I am now 30, single, and no kids) I hope this helps even one single person take a moment before harming yourself. 

First, I'm sorry. Sorry you ever spoke a word to me or had to hear me speak a word. Sorry you had to meet me, and sorry you are reading this if you have gotten this far. Please don't take this the wrong way, this is just a petty explanantion if anyone wanted one. I wasted an opportunity to be a shining light on this world, and spent my time blowing out the flames. I've taken advantage of everyone and everything I could have. I lost everyone close to me and only blame myself. I made the conscious effort to slowly peel away from society. I've been half-assing my way through everything in life, and keep taking all that I can. It's petty and pathetic to say, but I truly wish I had never been
born. If I go out on my terms, my organs would be deemed useless and unable to help those who need them, and they can help many who are in dire need in order to live. I am but a hollow corpse waiting to seize the moment. I know I wouldn't leave a mess for anyone to see, that would
be too tough on my family. I've been detached from nearly every emotion, and feel nothing. It's crazy to think
that a thought in the mind can be felt in the inner workings of a person. Maybe I am rationalizing, but this isn't depression, it's something more, something much more. I hpe to
say farewell to those who took time and attempted to make a connection with me. I couldn't tell you how many times you have gotten me through ""tough"" times in my life. Tough in quotations as they weren't tough at all, I was just, and continue to be, too weak willed. I used to want to be the center of attention, but that quickly dissipated.
I long for the moment when I can easily fade away without much discussion or notice, but I can't pinpoint the exact moment when I felt so pathetic and unnessesary. I feel as if i belong in the background, so no one really notices, maybe that way the ""loss"" is miniscule. I was the one who chose to distort and or not pursue further personal relationships and instead sought momentary self-satisfaction. I severed countless opportunities because l only thought of myself. I always wondered what people saw in me that I never saw in myself, then before the end, I made them question their own judgement into why they thought they saw anything in me as well. The doubts and questions placed into their mind, and hurt into their heart was my fault. Not that anyone was ever physically hurt, but emotionally damaged. Even if it was not a lasting pain and only for a split-second, nothing I can do can make up for that damage I caused. Again, this is not a plea for attention or a cry for help, nor is this a farewell or goodbye. This is simply a poor attempt to answer any questions that may arise.

Lastly, I am sorry to my family. I love you all so much, even though I have never shown it. You were always there for me no matter how shitty of a person I became. To my mom and dad, I am so sorry I wasn't the son you envisioned. I know I am a disappointment, and I only blame myself. You two deserved a better son, with everything you have done for me. You wanted me to become something, but I still fell flat on my face. I wish you had another son, one to make you proud to point him out. One who made a difference. One who truly mattered.



(Thank you if you have gotten this far) Either way, please think of your friends, family and loved ones. Treat everyone fairly, and remeber that you matter and are loved.

I’m lucky tho, i know that many people don’t continue to see psychiatrist because they don’t find a psychiatrist that suit them, but i like my psychiatrist, she doesn’t judge me at all, she really takes her time to get to know me and my problems.

Struggling With A Dysfunctional Family,"Hello everyone. Long 9 paragraph post ahead.

A bit of background before I explain things. I'm the eldest child of three. My dad works in a manager position while my mom is a stay at home parent. The current negative state of my family is due to all five of us in some way but the ones who contribute to it the most, in my opinion, are my mom and youngest sibling.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As I mentioned, my mother is a stay at home parent. She left her last job almost two decades ago and has been running the house ever since. Throughout my time with her, I have seen her go through at least two phases: her less religious phase and her current more religious phase. During her less religious phase which overlaps with the time she was working, she would often micro-manage my studies to such an extent that she would expect me to study a set number of hours a day which was about 6 hours a day for different subjects and fill in those hours in a book that she would check every night. If I did not fulfill those 6 hours, the remaining time would be carried over the next day. She eventually dropped that system. When she became more religious, she started expecting the entire family to take part in a number of religious rituals like sprinkling salted water around the house while reciting holy text.

One thing consistent about her is that she has always practiced a very strict form of parenting. She used to expect us to maintain our grades high and she would dictate the way we dressed and our haircuts. She has friends from teenage years. In comparison to my siblings and I, her friends' children are a lot more successful than her children. Some of those friends' children have extremely impressive career resumes, some have their own businesses, some are very talented and some are just very sociable that you can't help but like them. My siblings and I are nothing compared to them. Whenever I get into an argument with her, she would keep a cold shoulder to the entire immediate family. When she and I finally sit down to resolve the argument, she always manages to manipulate the situation where she comes out the victim and the winner. 

Every other day, she has mood swings that are unpredictable. Sometimes she's talkative and sometimes she's moody and when she's moody, she's very moody. When she's moody, she's like that for several days and spreads her moodiness to everyone in the immediate family. She's like that even to my father who works so hard and is always soft-spoken and kind to her. When I was younger, she would expect her children to always sit down and almost never talk during meals. As a result, every time my family goes out to eat, we almost NEVER talk at the table in the restaurant. I look around and envy other groups in the restaurant who are happily chatting and laughing with each other. She usually cooks at home, more so during quarantine. Whenever she cooks, I try and offer her help. Sometimes she accepts it and other times she tells me she can handle it herself. A few times, when I was doing assignments while she was cooking, no one helped her and she got mad at the ENTIRE FAMILY for a few days.

She often criticizes our behavior and the behavior of other people outside the family. She talks about how messy my aunt's house is, she talks about how my cousins who are less disciplined but more socially successful than my siblings and I have too much freedom. I've tried confronting her several times about her behavior but every time I do, she gets defensive by crying and saying she tries so hard and brings up every recent mistake or unacceptable behavior I did that she can think of. As a result, nothing get resolved and she continues with her behavior.

My youngest sibling has always had an attitude problem since young. He was quite spoiled by our parents, I would say a lot more than his older two siblings. Since young, he had a PS2, PS3, PSP, laptop and smart phone and has developed an addiction to electronic devices. All throughout the day, he will play with either of these devices at home or when we go out. Once when we were on vacation, all his devices were taken away from him because he his addiction was so bad and he started throwing a tantrum saying ""I'm so bored!"" repeatedly when our parents were gone. Even when people come over to the house, he is on his devices and almost NEVER talks to any of the guests. Ever since he got his own room, things have gotten worse. He often locks his room door and spends late nights playing some MMO with online people. When he isn't playing with his devices, he sleeps all day and has very bad sleeping habits as a result. He sleeps too much and is almost always in an irritable mood and rolls his eyes whenever he talks to anyone in the immediate family. Whenever he is given chores to do, he often doesn't do it very well to the point that I have to take over and do it properly. Other times, he delays his chores and ends forgetting to do it. If I had to describe his mindset, it would be 'Play first, work later'.

As result of this, my youngest sibling and my mother clash the most. Quarantine has amplified the toxicity between the two of them and things escalated very badly the previous night at the time that I am writing this post. He absolutely refused to eat dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning with everyone else. When I knocked on his door, he did not answer or open the door. I have not seen him for the past 15 hours as of this moment. I do not know if he is alive or dead, in his room or has runaway. My mother, on the other hand, who has always insisted on everyone having our meals together no longer bothers with this.

My father has devoted his entire personality and time to his work. I've had a few casual conversations with my father to bond with him but our relationship still feels a bit distant. I'm planning to talk to my other sibling about how things are in the family. My other sibling is the only one in the family that I've ever had pleasant memories with. We grew up playing the same toys and I always feel comfortable talking to him because he always listens and never judges me. I often do my best to return his kindness.

Please everyone. I am at a loss of what to do. My family has always had cracks in it but this past year during quarantine, everything has fallen apart. I want to make things better but it seems there is nothing left to hope for. My mental health is taking a toll as a result.

i don't love,"my ex messaged me yesterday and said that she loves me and i know its not true. she only thinks that because i'm something to fixate on and i would talk her out of self harm. over time i've realized how ready people are to use you especially if you're an easy target. i'm so dumb that i can't even tell when i'm being treated poorly until after the fact. i think it's literally impossible for me to love at this point and it hurts to know that and not be able to do anything about it  


after i got that message and talked to her for a little i spent all day laying on the floor. all i was able to do is look at social media and occasionally jerk off. i heavily considered relapsing S/H but i know that it won't make me feel anything. i know that its not going to get easier and ill always be this way i just want to be able to kind of deal with it so i can fuck off and live a semi normal life",Patient_Breakfast140,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6qouo/i_dont_love/

Kinda terrified of abilify,"So my psychiatrist recently put me on 2mg Abilify to augment my regimen of Wellbutrin 300mg. I understand this is a pretty low dose, but I've only taken one dose as of this morning, and want to stop. My leg is already a little restless naturally, and got a little more so, but didn't really bother me. 

What did, however, is the brain fog I've been feeling all day. I've been able to function fine, do my schoolwork, be alert on the road, etc., and on the plus side my mood feels a bit more stable, but, I've just felt this kind of ""haze"" all day, which I might compare to a very light dose of THC, for those who partake. 

I've been reading the side effects as well, and they kinda spooked me out. It doesn't help that I've had a resting heart reate of ~80 since the early afternoon, and bit ago, I was sitting and doing work, , when my heart rate shot up to 210 bpm, and then went back down to 90 in the span of 2 minutes! (I have a smart watch that monitors)

I was a little worried about some stuff earlier, but I kinda forgot about it, so not sure if it was anxiety. I've never experienced that, though. I'm also starting to get some very light tremors. 


The thing that scares me the most is the weight gain. I've been overweight for a long time, and I've fought so hard to make the weight loss progress I have. I don't know if the wellbutrin will cancel out the effects, but I keep reading anecdotes about how even eating healthy at a deficit and exercise doesn't prevent weight gain. I don't want to fuck it all up now. 


My question is that is it normal to want to discontinue after 1 day? Is this just a temporary thing? Should I give it a chance?

A New Kind of Shut Down,"Hey there, Reddit! I don't know where else to put this... I (F17) have been depressed for a few years now, diagnosed over a year ago, and as much as it hurts, I'm used to it. Or, at least, I was... I was working part-time (retail, yuck!) and going to college full-time last semester and it broke me. I ended up taking this semester off in an agreement with my parents that they'd get me to see a therapist so I could get better before returning to classes. Surprise, surprise, they backed out on that deal (because ""psychiatry is a load of bull\*\*\*\*""). As bad as last semester was, in these past couple of weeks, I've discovered a new low... I've been ""shut down"" for the past four years, barely able to function and keep up in the world, partially thanks to ADHD, so I don't know what to call this deeper sort of shut-down feeling... I'm completely shut off in a way I never have been before. I can't even call in my med refills (I run out tomorrow and I'm just stuck unable to do anything) or do laundry or keep up with my hobbies and friends. In the past, I've managed to catch up with things thanks to anxiety's adrenaline rush, but now I'm not even feeling the anxiety adrenaline. I feel as dead as someone can be while still breathing... I've hit low points in life, I've been su\*cidal before, I've self-harmed before.... but now I feel almost past that, and not in a good way. Like, in a ""what's the point of that when I'm already pretty much dead"" way. It's like some sort of intense, long-lasting dissociation. I don't know.

It scares me, a lot. It's so different to how depression felt before... And I can't even think of any specific event that caused this shut-down. It feels like it just faded in, gradually crushing me.

Is this maybe just a ""NEW LEVEL UNLOCKED!: EVEN WORSE DEPRESSION"" or could this be something else? I've recently begun thinking about possible CPTSD from emotional toxicity/abuse from my family, but I've been dealing with that my whole life, why would it make me shut down now?

Lost,"I don't know what to do anymore with my life. I feel so lost and have no sense of direction. I'm 23 with no education because I sort of failed high school or I'll didn't fully complete it. Been trying to work to make ends meet but had a horrible time with that because my whole fucking life I been sheltered from the world to the point now I just don't know how to operate as an adult. I feel like I failed my mother who sometimes it sometimes feels embarrassed I'm even her son it seems. 

Any friendships that came into my life has gone because I either never stayed in touched or moved away. Friendships that had the potential of being long lasting I assumed but because of my lack of determination, charisma and interests, it never works out. So that's why I just stay to myself due to feeling like a burden and a problem to everyone. 

All my siblings are older than me so I never had anybody my age to be around except for places like school and work but like I typed before, it never worked out. I mean damn, I really feel like I'm not shit and will never be shit in this life. 

I try to think better of myself when I do accomplish things but I'm just fixated on all the negative shit that has happened and that is currently happening to where I can't see beyond it. It's like my mind is consumed by negativity and it bums me out. 

I know it sounds like I'm victimizing myself but that's alright. I'm aware that everything in my life up until this point at 23 years old is a product of my own choices in life. I can't blame anyone else because it's no one else's fault that I feel this way. I just suck at being human I guess lol. 

So with all that going on within my consciousness, suicide has been a ongoing reoccurring theme in my mind. I think about whether life would be easier without me in the picture since nobody would have to be bothered trying to coach me into adult life at 23. I feel like I would be better off dead than going through life a lost and annoying piece of shit who just makes things worse for everybody. A true parasite indeed. 

I look at those my age and see them with houses, successful careers, and all the hard work they put in to get to where they are now. I wish I was that independent and sure of myself at this age.

I also am an Escapist and love movies, shows, and videos, which I also enjoyed watching that year.

I had an amazing time until October 2020 hit and I started experiencing seasonal depression because I wanted it to be Spring again. Though I eventually was able to overcome it.

It's 2021, and my sister had already left back for college. My other sister is getting ready to be a senior.  School was starting up, and I noticed I began becoming depressed. I'm not a usually a big crier, but I've been crying multiple times a week. I hate going back to school. I hate having to be forced back into going places all the time. Sometimes I feel a little better, but it's not very comforting because I know later that same day I'll become depressed again. 

I'm anxious anytime I have to go somewhere.

I've been having trouble turning in assignments for school for quite a while, but now I can't seem to do any of them. 

I keep reflecting on the last year. Little moments I enjoyed. It brings me a quick-lived sense of happiness that will turn to hopelessness and depression once I reflect on the fact I can't relive those moments again.

I don't know how I'm going to deal with high school next year when we're fully back to normal, and I might begin experiencing seasonal depression again. 

I don't even want to get over it, accept 2021, or socialize with classmates. I want to relive 2020.",TelekineticMaster444,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6pg4v/i_am_having_trouble_moving_on_from_2020/

Personal hygiene.,"Hello everyone. I don't really know how to start this. So I'll just write my question.

I've had severe depression for two years now. And diagnosed bipolar too.

Personsl hygiene and cooking has been the hardest. Even more so recently the last month's. And I don't really know how to get out of bed every day. My teeth have gotten a few holes now. And I can barely remember the last time I ate a real dinner. Showering is a pain but easier if I take a bath. 

My psychiatrist isn't really of that much help when I'm this low. What do you people do to get the willpower to do the more mundane things of life?

I hope questions are allowed here. Thank you in advance.

Frustrated,"Honestly, I’m fucking exhausted.

I’ve been hyper focused on my mental health recently, trying to overcome my codependency issues by learning how to set up boundaries.

I also have BPD and likely CPTSD with some symptoms that look like ADHD.

My life feels so out of control and I’m spiraling harder than I ever have in my life.

I’m experiencing what I think is burnout.

I feel so overwhelmed purely by my emotions and the mental health aspect of my life that I’m too crippled to be able to function properly in the areas of physical health, work, relationships and maintaining a clean home.

How can I stop this burnout? How can I stop this obsession with being hyper vigilant about my mental health?

Especially with my BPD, I don’t want to hurt anyone, but it’s really hard when the person you’re around most is constantly invalidating you and calling you crazy.

My parents hold me to super high standards that I just can’t meet and it makes me feel like a let down compared to my other family members.

Sexual frustration is leading to depression,"Hi, 
I've been venting on this subreddit since early year, but the last month was refreshing. I felt very alive. But every 2 months, I feel this overwhelming sexual frustration, which is making me more and more depressed. And these episodes are increasing every year. Any suggestions how to tackle this? Should I go to therapy? Is there a chance that this will become very much a problem in my life? Or is it just some kind of phase? What is the proper approach on how to fight this?

Woke up today feeling like shit,"Was doing okay-ish maybe ~5 days ago. Then the mental burden slowly started weighing in again over the last few days, signalling the start of another vicious cycle. 

Today I woke up feeling worthless, mentally incapacitated, hated by others and wishing I was dead. I’m sick of these mood swings between being neutral and downright beat and defeated. 

I’ve been taking in increasingly heavier doses of melatonin lately to force myself to sleep so I can escape my thoughts. And when I wake up, the split second where I’m groggy and regaining consciousness, everything feels somewhat peaceful for a while and the next moment, fuck. I’m still alive and here and I’m back to this sorry excuse of an existence. 

I’m still waiting to receive a mental assessment, my counsellor is away this week, and I am unprepared for what I’m gonna say to the assessor and I’m too exhausted to try organise my thoughts so I can better express my situation to them. 

My best friend who knew about my situation now thinks I’ve got it under control, but fuck I’m far from being fine. I’m not okay. But I don’t want to burden her further or let her down because she gave me encouragement for making progress. So now I feel more alone than ever, stuck in this pit that I can seemingly never get out of and I wish a freak accident happens to me. And my irrational brain just insists that I’m already hated, and I’m just gonna make her hate me more if I say that. So here I am, just keeping everything to myself. 

I told another friend of mine, I can’t promise I will never attempt suicide in my lifetime. I don’t know when I’ll break, so I’m sorry.",ReminiXence,1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6oxbc/woke_up_today_feeling_like_shit/
"I just need a win, even a small one.","A quick summary of how my life is going: Mortgage company isn’t doing their job in managing my escrow. They’re useless so now for their mistakes I owe them $1500. Job sucks. Worked my ass off for three years going well beyond my job description, providing actual value to the company. Boss tells me HR denied my promotion for financial reasons, even though there are people in my role who I can prove have done way less and got the promo. And none of the jobs I’m applying to are even giving me interviews.


So on to the main topic of this thread.

May the 4th, my company posts a competition for a $25 target giftcard for the best photo of you in a Star Wars costume. I’m like ok this is up my alley, I can actually win one of these contests that my employer has been doing since went to WFH for the pandemic. I have a badass kylo Ren costume from before force awakens came out. Custom made by my wife’s friend who has a very successful Etsy shop making medieval costumes. And I have the Kylo Ren force fx lightsaber. 


So I post a good photo of me in the full getup. Then other submissions start trickling in. They’re all fucking dressed as Chewbacca. Like maybe one or two lame cheap costumes with just he front of a storm trooper mask, etc. I think I have this in the bag.


May 5th, they announced the winner. A dad dressed as (you guessed it) Chewbacca holding his toddler who is dressed up as a porg. Look kids are cute and all but the fucking contest was for you not your kids.

Realizing the only thing I’m good at is surviving,"Gosh. I feel so depressed. I’m in the middle of finals for PhD work and my writing sucks. Then I think of all the other things I’ve tried and I just...suck. In my 20s I had this sort of exuberance that maybe I just haven’t found what I’m good at..now in my 30s after having instability my entire life I realize that I’m actually not good at anything I try. 

In childhood I wasn’t really encouraged to practice anything. Instead, I spent a lot of time surviving my home life and my neighborhood. So there’s that. I’m good at surviving. I’m good at calling the suicide hotline when I feel like killing myself, I’m good at leaving violent situations by the skin of my teeth, I’m good at somehow finding shelter when I’m about to be homeless, I’m good at working below poverty jobs and somehow getting by. 

Fuck though. If my life is just about survival what the hell is the point? I want to thrive, not just survive.

I just want someone to love me,"     Nine or so months ago, I found out that the woman of my dreams—really nice, great personality, cute, beautiful name that I adore (the first two matter most)—was dating my best friend. It set me down a downward and depressive spiral. It pains me every day to see my best friend live the life I want to live, to be in the perfect relationship I want, to have the woman I want. And anytime me and her talk, she always has to mention him over and over again. There is no beak from hearing about their relationship. I just want to be in a perfect relationship of my own. With someone who loves me. I would kill to have someone who loves me HALF AS MUCH as she loves him. And I have recently found hope, but my mind won’t stop making me hopeless. I think it’s just because I don’t want my heart broken again. I just want someone who I can love and that loves me. I literally pray for it every night (despite not believing in any established religion). I don’t know. Emotions are quite odd.

    I think the song “I Know It’s Over” by the Smiths really describes what I’m feeling, but in musical form.

     That isn’t the only reason I’m depressed, but it’s one of the main reasons. The other reasons include unfortunate situations that leaded to mental issues.

I (14f) was raped: update,"I(14f) can't take this anymore to be completely honest. I have to get it all down and out of my head. I don't know what to do about any of this. I'm still coming to terms with it. *sigh* 

Okay. My name (or online alias) is Rue. So, all of the events that I'm about to tell you about happened from ages 4-10. I don't remember when each thing happened so I do apologize for that. 

When I was younger I had this group of friends. They're all much older than me. Each of em' being 5 or 6 years older than me so as of now they're all 19 or 20. I'm going to be calling them BAS. I would use their names but I won't out of fear someone I know may see this and do something to them. And before i get into the story, yes, they're all girls. 

So, BAS. They were really my only friends throughout my childhood, I was bullied a lot in elementary school and Im the youngest of 5 so my siblings never really hung out with me much. BAS were my friends. I like to think so anyways. At first they did abandon me quite a bit. They would make me stay at the top of the street while they all went off and hung out. I remember sitting at the top of the street on my bike with our home phone waiting for them to tell me when to come down. They never did until they came back up and went home. 

Let it be know that I do still deeply care for and love each one of these girls. I know I probably shouldn't, but they were still there for me when no one else was, even if they were still horrible to me. They helped me survive my childhood while also making it worse for me in the future. I have mixed feelings about it all if you can't tell. 

My home life wasn't the best (I don't feel like getting into it too much so just trust me or look at some of my other posts if you'd like) and so I was more often than not hanging out with BAS. 

So. Here goes everything. The part I've been locking up in my mind for so very long. It's been slowly draining me and eating away at the little will to live I have left. 

They rape me. 

It all starts with a blanket fort and some good old fashioned truth or dare. 

Harmless? Right.. 

Well, no. I'm gonna tell you what I remember, and I'm not sure that I remember it all but I'm honestly sorry if you have read this far and are going to continue on because it gets bad for little 4-10 year old Rue from here on out. 

The first thing about truth or dare I remember was the rules. After 2 truths you HAD to pick a dare or else you had to do the punishment (it was probably something stupid like lick a toilet seat or something I dunno) and so I always followed their rules. Keep in mind I also wanted to impress them cause they were older and cool and I wanted to be accepted as their friend. I remember this dare. ""I dare you to eat me out."" Now at the time I had no clue what that was so they showed me by eating me out and then had me do the same. I ate the one who dared me out, A. I dont remember a lot from it..thinking about it makes me kinda sick cause I viewed them as my sisters. And this one happened in our little blanket fort. Parts of me will probably never trust blanket forts again heh.. 

The next thing I remember was the group masturbation. It was probably also cause of a dare but I dont remember. I remember them taking me to the bathroom with them (none of this takes place at my house or when any adult is anywhere around) and them taking their pants and underwear off, telling me to do the same. I did as I was told. I remember not knowing what was happening and then them shoving a uh, a plunger inside me (hurt a lot) and kind of, uhm, ig, raping me with it...then they told me to keep doing it to myself and I did as I was told even though it hurt. They were masturbating and moaning. They never turned the lights on. I can't imagine seeing their faces after they did something like that to me.. 

The third thing I remember. I dont remember very much from this. But A had a dog and BAS kept daring me to suck his dick. I don't recall ever doing it but I remember how much pressure they put on me to do it.. 

And the final thing I remember....
Probably one of the hardest things to remember.. 

BAS tried to get me to suck my brothers dick. 
My brother was also friends with BAS (he had/has no idea what BAS did to me) and they were playing truth or dare. My brother didn't know I was there. They blindfolded him and put earmuffs on his head so he had no idea what was happening. He unzipped his pants and they pulled out his dick..horrifying...then they started forcing my head down, trying to make me give my own brother a blow job....I broke free and ran away, I ran to the park and just cried for a while. My brother still has no idea that this happened to me and I have no idea what happened after I left... 

BAS did a lot to me...but they were intertwined with my entire family. Everyone in my family knew/knows them and all still love them dearly. I'm unsure of how to proceed with all of this constantly bouncing around in my head..it's hard to handle. Some people say I should press charges but I know it'd be too late. I love BAS anyways and dont know if I could ever face them while bringing this up. 

almost all of you encouraged me to speak out to my family or trusted adult and/or go to the police and go to court with them. 

Now, I'm not saying reporting them hasn't crossed my mind because it definitely has, however, you must take into account the logicality of it all. The incidents that I talked about all happened four or more years ago. That's a pretty long time to not only not report it but to also be unbothered by it. Up until recently (this summer and on) I hadn't even thought about BAS or what they did to me. It rarely crossed my mind and when it did I just saw it as childhood memories. Nothing more, nothing less. 

While doing this may have helped me in that short period of time that nothing was happening with BAS it's caused me to only just now realize the horrors I've endured. It can be hard to grasp the full gravity of the situation, for me anyways. I'm sure for people on the outside looking in it's rather simple to see how awful what they did was and what to do about it. 

So let me tell you this... 

This is by no means an easy task. Not in the slightest. I don't know if you realize this but I suffer from severe depression, social anxiety, schizophrenia, insomnia, self injurious behaviours, and suicidal ideations. I'm a freshman in high school and online school has made it incredibly difficult for me to learn much of anything. I've also been in and out of the mental hospital three times this past year; The most recent time if me being admitted was the 18th of January. 

Keeping all of this in mind, let me continue. 

I grew up with BAS. I've known them since I was born and have only not been in contact with them for 4ish years. I grew up with these girls, shared experiences, endured pain, laughed, cried, screamed, hugged, and loved them all. Each and every one of these three girls still holds a deep place in my heart. I hold them close to me. I appreciate the good memories and am just now starting to work through the bad. The way I see it, there's no such thing as a bad person. Though people do bad things and make bad decisions, I still see them as good people. Now, that doesn't mean I'll keep those hurtful people in my life because at this point I've learned not to. People grow and change for the better. These 3 girls each had pretty hard home lives, some more than others. That doesn't excuse what they did to me but it's easier to understand their point of view for me seen as I know what it was like for them all. 

I love them. I've tried to hate them, I've wanted to hate them. I just have no room for hate in my life and I genuinely can't hate BAS. 

So keep in mind that while I was growing up with these girls, the rest of my family was too. My mother, father, grandmas, brother, and sister all knew these girls since they were born. While me, my other brother, and my other sister all knew them since we were born. My family loved these girls (some more than others granted) and saw them as a part of the family. 

Now imagine having children and finding out that three of them raped your youngest daughter. 

Do you realize how heart breaking that would be? How empty and numb you would feel. How angry and naive and just overwhelmingly paralyzed you'd be. You'd be heart broken and empty.. 

I can't do that to my family. I've seen that look in each one of my family members eyes and heard their voices breaking (when I first got caught cutting myself). I swore to myself I'd never make them feel that way again. 

I dont know what to do exactly. Dealing with such a situation is delicate and very emotionally exhausting. 

I'd like to bring these girls to justice if I knew that it'd go the way I'd plan it to. But I have no proof of any of this happening, nor do I have witnesses. It's simply my word against theirs. 

I see no point in ruining these girls' lives along with my own family. I can't afford pressing charges and it probably wouldn't work anyways. 

I fear they may do this to other innocent people but I don't think they would.. 

I'm aware I could always be wrong but is the risk worth the reward? 

I wonder if it was my fault. Was it something I said or did? How strange to never know the truth. These thoughts keep coming no matter how hard I try to keep them out. Would it have all stopped if I had simply said no? Or was there no changing what happened. How could I have avoided such a thing? Being raped. Repeatedly. For years. By the people I loved, trusted, and saw as family. How does a person get over something like that? What did I do to spark the idea in their head? Was it the clothes? The way I talked? The way I walked? How i admired them? How badly I wanted them to accept me? How naive I was. What did i do to deserve it. How did i make them do such a thing? Why did I let them do such a thing.. How did I tempt them to rape me..? Simply how. I could've said no, yet I didn't; This begs the question: Was it not rape because I asked for it by not saying no..?

I'm obsessed with a prison warden to the point it hurts,"I have BPD and it can lead to obsessing over specific people. There's this person (Mark Davis) I've been fixated on since around 2015. It's like when I saw him, there was this INSTANT interest/bond.

Ever since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, everything, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.

Just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. I just love how dorky he is, I think he's absolutely adorable and he's always so lively..

I haven't met him in person yet, but I hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times. I remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children. Then I snapped out of it.. I think he may have BPD himself too. But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real.

He comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now.

I've had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. Even now when I'm imagining him dying I literally feel physically sick to my stomach. I feel like if he died I'd have a nervous breakdown and I feel like crying right now just because I'm having to even bring that up.

Problem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not. I don't know what to do and I don't feel like I want to discuss this with a doctor because I'd seem crazy and stalker-ish. I sort of consider him as... a friend?

"Depressed since childhood, turning 25 this month... How do you guys deal with your long-term depression?","Growing up I lived a life some would say ""privileged"", I went to an international school in a foreign country, but the reality is that anyone I ever made friends with would move to another continent, let alone a country, and I couldn't even speak the local language! which all took a massive toll on me (Pre-social media era, not many people adopted it around then). Looking back on school reports, even from the young age of 5, the teachers always commented on how reserved/quiet I was and that ""I needed to ask more questions in class if he wants to get good grades"". 

I've gotten through life since then by not getting attached to anyone, but I've had minimal motivation and never a sense of happiness just living day to day. My Dad, who I would say was my best friend growing up and one of the few constants in my life, suffered a very severe hemorrhagic stroke 2 years ago this october. He's living his genuine living nightmare, as a kid he always told me he would never want to carry on living if he was ever in this state, I can only imagine the torture he's going through. He has been asked if he wants to continue living and he adamantly gave a thumbs up, so it's a relief he's not giving up, he's always been the strongest person I've known and bounced back from every injury in the past, so it's amazing to know he still has that drive left. Regardless of all of his efforts, there have been setbacks after setbacks, and because of the pandemic I've not been able to visit him, and have been limited to infrequent Skype sessions with him.  There isn't a day where I don't think and cry about him.  I took grief counseling sessions to deal with this for 8 weeks but it just didn't seem to help, going to these sessions in the mornings would ruin the rest of the day for me, making my ability to focus on work a lot harder. So I ended the sessions :/ 

Although the pandemic has been pretty terrible for my family (and many others), I managed to find love for the first time in my life, she is honestly the most incredible and most understanding/caring person I've ever met.  I know my life with her is going to be so much better than it has ever been, yet I don't know if I'll ever shake off this depression.  I have to smoke weed everyday to stop me from spiraling into a long crying session or depressed days which would otherwise affect my ability to do my job.  I don't  contemplate suicide and I've told my mother all about everything I've mentioned and assured her I would never do something, my goal in life is to own a successful game studio so until then I'm too stubborn to quit :) My Mother is better than any mother I could ever ask for, I feel incredibly sad for my mum's situation but she's doing the best she can and I'm always here for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else dealing with lifelong depression or has been able to overcome it? Do I accept it's just a part of who I am at this point and try and use it to my benefit? or should I start proper therapy?

A note I found myself writing tonight: Immunity,"
People will tell you you’re not alone when you say you have depression 

They’ll tell you everybody gets sad sometimes 

They say: 

“Take a walk, get some fresh air”

“Put your phone away and have a picnic”

“Read a book in the bath, have a night of self-care”

But what do you do when you’ve tried it all and nothing did the trick?

I’ve bought all the best bath bombs, sugar scrubs and body washes they make

I maxed out my library card and filled bookshelves with every adventure book google could suggest 

I got a puppy and a kitten and friends and a relationship, even after heartbreak

I ate veggies on a picnic blanket in the sun as the breeze sunk pollen filled breaths into my chest

I drove with the windows down, AC blaring more than my radio and sang songs off key at sun-down

I found beauty in the world around me

I took photos of my favorite sunsets, wrote journals full of my days, cataloging every little detail I love about my town 

I made plans with friends and laughed and cried into the night, completely care free 

I found new shows to binge and new movies to love and new songs to sing in the shower 

I drank water and cut out my favorite guilty pleasure foods, I even emptied my snack drawer 

I walked and hiked and swam and ran in a field of wildflowers 

I bought new clothes, new bedding, a new phone case, new room decor

I moved my bed, I changed my Pinterest boards to track my progress

I went thrifting, I painted art, I celebrated 

I cried, I screamed into the black night, I was hopeless 

I tried everything they told me, I read every buzzfeed article and watched every YouTube video that related 

I loved myself, I gave myself passes, I treated myself with respect and understanding 

No matter what I tried, none of it worked

I think my depression is immune, but I don’t have immunity",AdministrationFine52,23,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n62o7s/a_note_i_found_myself_writing_tonight_immunity/

Hair Loss and Depression.,"Lemme start by saying I was diagnosed with depression when I was 17, been on anti-depressants on and off ever since. My hair was the only part of my physical appearance that I actually liked.  Flowing, thick curls. Now it looks like I have dry, stringy pubes on my head. Thanks, male pattern baldness. I’m 21 years old and my hairline looks like that of a much older man. It is so hard facing my friends, who all still have their hair. It has totally overtaken my thought process, one glance at my hair will send me into a spiral for the rest of the day. Balding is often portrayed and spoken about so negatively, and it feels very dehumanizing, I feel like I’ve lost a part of my identity and legitimacy.  I am on finasteride and rogaine (anti hair loss drugs) and they don’t seem to be working very well. Despite trying my best to stay active, go to therapy, and be productive, my hair loss continues to wreak utter havoc on my mental health, and I genuinely don’t recognize the person I see in the mirror, and really don’t want to be this person.  It has seriously exacerbated pre-existing insecurities, and has most definitely worsened my depression. I have had suicidal urges for some time now, and I notice that my hair is a reliable trigger for these urges, in addition to some other stuff. Anyone else out there struggling? Any advice?

I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I don’t know if all this is going to belong on this subreddit but I literally don’t know what else to do anymore.

So to set the stage I guess I’ll explain a little about myself:
I’m a 26 year old male, currently no permanent job, no real hobbies unless you include watching youtube, watching anime and playing video games (which is about every day of my life so I don’t count them). I don’t really have any ambition or goal I want to work toward in my life. I have no talents whatsoever, believe me, I’ve tried doing just about everything. I’m not very smart either, it takes a lot for even basic concepts to sink in. I also have pretty severe self image issues, I hate literally everything about myself; my appearance, my voice, my name, my attitude, everything. I’m a shut-in who goes outside at most once a fortnight. Ironically, despite being a shut-in I hate the house I’m living in. There’s no room for anything and it constantly feels cramped. It takes a lot to not want to set this sorry excuse for a house on fire, or punch holes in the goddamn walls. I have no real friends in my life that I can hang out with. I live with just my mum at home. I have Aspergers and ADHD so communicating with people, especially those I have never met before, a real challenge for me. This also makes phone calls extremely difficult. I can never call someone and only answer a call if I know it’s coming beforehand. Lastly, I have virtually no life skills so I’m basically forced to leech off of others like a parasite. (If anything else is needed I’ll edit it in later) 

Before I continue I just want to say, while I do feel like I would be better off dead, or even better, having never existed at all, I have no desire to kill myself even if thoughts of suicide swirl around in my brain. “If I just drive full speed into oncoming traffic...”, “I could just swallow this whole bottle of sleeping pills”, shit like that.

I have always been depressed since high school but it feels like it’s getting worse and worse lately. And I know this isn’t due to the current pandemic because I’ve actually been having a relatively great time. I have more money in my bank account than ever before thanks to government payments. And I lost over 20kg (healthily) making me the lightest I’ve been since high school. I think my depression is getting worse because things are actually getting back to normal. Being forced to look for work again has triggered my self-loathing thoughts and heightened my sense of worthlessness again.

I managed to graduate high school but without a single certificate to my name. I hated it. I couldn’t figure out what I wanted back then and I still can’t even 10 years later. No jobs these days hire without experience or qualifications, which makes sense, of course, but after school trying to get those qualifications is a lot more difficult AND expensive. Almost defeats the point of trying.

Sorry if that was an odd tangent, I’m just trying to get my thoughts out there even if they might make this post jumbled.

Anyway, I guess I’ll explain what inspired me to make this post now, despite feeling like this for years now. Yesterday, I received a phone call from a charity I donate to thanking me for my support. It was so scripted I swear I could almost see the guy reading it off his computer screen. Then, he tells me I’m a good person. What? 
(I didn’t mention this above but I am far from a good, decent person. I frequently wish death upon people I dislike simply because I think they shouldn’t exist. I despise people who are wealthy and wish them misfortune out of pure jealousy because I grew up poor, which I still am. I ignore people’s suffering - (including my own mother who has dealt with chronic pain for well over 10 years due to an accident, and I’ve just grown so tired of hearing her moan and complain about it even though I know it’s not her fault) - because they have nothing to do with me. Why should I care about people I don’t know or have ever met? And yes, I am fully aware of the hypocrisy of me posting this cry for help despite not wanting to help others. That’s how selfish and broken I am as a person. “So why?”, you ask. “Why did you start donating to a charity if you don’t care about helping people?” 
Simple. I was out with a friend who flew upstate to come meet and hangout with me and we just happened to be stopped by those people you always see who want you to sign up for shit. And neither of us could just say “no”. I immediately regretted it but still haven’t quit yet because I said I’d give it 2 years.)

So back to that phone call. The moment I heard “good person” I started tearing up. Even now as I type this it’s happening again. What about that previous paragraph makes me a good person?! It took everything I had to keep it together until that call ended, and as soon as it did I just broke down sobbing. Even knowing everything the guy said was scripted, even knowing I’m a rotten person deep down, why do those 2 words hurt me so much?

If you’re thinking it’s because subconsciously I want to be a better person you’re dead wrong. I want nothing more than to continue my selfish, jobless, wasteful life where I consume all the media I want, whenever I want, without a single care in the whole fucking world. I could just do without the depression. Honestly, if I won the lottery that is exactly what I’d do.

Ugh, this post is getting less cohesive now, sorry about that. I’m getting tired of typing because this app is slow as fuck.

I don’t even know what point I’m trying to make anymore.

If this post gets any responses, I’m not expecting anything, but let me save some people some time: No, I’m not going to seek professional help, it should be abundantly clear how anti-social I am. If I was the kind of person who could seek professional help, I’d have done it already instead of posting here.

I don’t think I’ve actually asked for help or advice on anything specific up to this point have I? Truthfully, I don’t even know what to ask. Maybe just general thoughts on me, or tips on how to help my mental state, or maybe telling some stories about yourselves (I don’t know when I’ll read them though).

Last paragraph now, if anyone has actually read everything then thank you. I honestly don’t deserve it. Time is probably the most valuable thing in the universe and you would have wasted yours on a depressed, un-caring, un-motivated, un-ambitious, self-loathing, talentless, skill-less, heartless, selfish, piece of shit like myself. You are actually a good person.",Nice-and-Chonky,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6moyz/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/
Everybody thinks I'm cold and unemotional,"I never cried in front of another person ever since my depression started around 5 years ago. I never really showed any sadness when I'm with someone. No matter how close we are, I never show anything other than happiness or boredom. I went to multiple funerals and never cried. When any family members die, I don't cry or show any emotion. Whenever there's something bad happening that affects me I don't feel sad, because it's ME and I don't care about myself. My friends who watched sad movies with me or experienced something particularly distressing with me always said it was weird that I don't cry and felt that I was a bad person.I know for a fact there's something that makes me cry every time. The only thing that makes me extremely sad is seeing or hearing others cry. No matter how much I love or hate the person, when someone is crying whether those are sad or happy tears, I always break down and have to go somewhere private to compose myself. If it's in a movie it doesn't affect me because I know it's fake and I can usually tell when someone is fake crying, but other than that, the sound of someone crying is extremely distressing for me.I wish I could feel sad when there's something bothering me as well. I feel like I have no respect for myself. I really hate myself as a person and I don't think anything I'm feeling is worth crying over. My therapist said it would help if I stopped trying not to cry but I'm not even trying. I just can't feel sorry for myself.

I'm so tired,"This year's been shit, I just can't deal with it anymore. I've tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but it's just gotten too much. 

Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world (that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed), but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldn't feel better, I'd sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what I've been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. 

In retrospect it's probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didn't. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I don't really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after it's been diagnosed, a complete mess. 

Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didn't exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldn't be going out. That's when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my family's health, but eventually I was sent in to school. 

Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. I've always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. 

I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. 

School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly weren't having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didn't feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didn't, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. 

My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didn't really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend (at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didn't listen to my concerns) so I wouldn't be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I don't know why it's just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. 

Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didn't do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. 

These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldn't work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. 

Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety I've ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. 

That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I can't do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started (a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed) and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldn't do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldn't. I didn't think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said that's just life, there's always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldn't cope with that anymore, I couldn't cope with that awful reality. I just didn't enjoy living anymore, and if it's this bad now as only a highschooler I couldn't imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again I'd ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. 

Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT (another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast) in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I don't think that's happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. 

So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I don't want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, I'm so tired of everything, I've been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why won't I feel better? I have a test for my driver's license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? I'm tired of it all, why won't it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?",DiegoBrandodBoots,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6mk1q/im_so_tired/
Confused,Where is the line between being sad and being depressed? I have been consistently “sad” for over a year now and it’s almost like I think it’s a phase but the suicidal thoughts don’t stop and if I was asked whether I could think of something I like about myself I couldn’t answer is that normal for someone who just feels sad? I don’t even know what being happy means anymore and any definition I’ve thought of is the opposite to my feelings I don’t want to self diagnose because of the negative stigma I’ve noticed around it. I know how I feel about myself is genuine and I feel as if suicide is an option for me and I feel like I’m discrediting my own emotions sometimes because I’m not diagnosed. I’m really confused the only thing I’m sure of is how much I hate every aspect of my life and feel as if my existence isn’t necessary. For people who are diagnosed or know about my situation I guess how am I meant to know?,sentinet,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6mg1p/confused/
Just wtf,"I don't even know where to start this or why I am even writing this. Excuse the predicted typos and grammatical errors I am typing this at 2 am drunk. I semi apologize in advance for how stupid this all might sound but i am genuinely fucking HURT. I am just lost as - as you know what. Well let's start with 2019- Literally the best year of my life, I had a nice group of friends, i was always going out, i lost a bunch of weight , i was happy, healthy and thriving. It seemed like everyday got better and it did, i ended up meeting my now fiance on a vacation in southern France ( a vacation i worked my ass off for a whole year working min wage to go to) 3 days after coming back in August I landed an amazing job with Chanel ( Literally do not know how i managed that ) &amp; I got accepted to university the same day as getting the new job- me and my dysfunctional ass family were finally good for once i literally had it the fuck all. (i was freshly 19 at the time). I don't know where it all went wrong, i literally do not. It came crumbling fast. The Chanel job was AMAZING, i was surrounded by new social people everyday, I made a bunch of new friends that were my age, everyday was a surprise, something to look forward to- It was the first job I was wholeheartedly was happy about and exited to go to. School started off pretty good too, i was just thriving - best i have ever been in life ( I put that on everything i love) My boss was really type B (type B on crack) she had a son my age and she started out very warm and motherly the first month but then became a micro managing, breathing down your neck, judgmental , always side eyeing YKW. She would always pick on the little things ( me not wearing enough makeup, one strand of hair being out of place, even saw a MAC lipstick in my pouch and shook her head at me) I honestly think in the beginning she was trying to help me, help me succeed with the brand , help me match the image of the company i was working for, etc. I did some stupid shit in the start of my working there, I was fresh back from a 2 month long vacation, newly in love, I was just high on life. The vacation me did not wear off, i was always smiley and chatty , texting my fiance constantly when i shouldn't, etc etc. When she had a conversation with me about that i did a complete 180 and snapped back into reality asap, i was no longer on my phone on the floor, i stayed in my section at all times, i was always on time, my sales were THROUGH THE ROOF, every single day, i was always booking appointments until max capacity, had a clientele within 2 months of working there , made 8 close close friend, the place felt like home, it was my home and safe space. Then January of 2020 things began to fall apart, i was working overtime at Chanel and couldn't keep up with school and ended up withdrawing from school, then my best friend and i ended up having a nasty nasty fight which almost got physical and we stopped being friends and did not talk ( Until now but it's not the same at all) , my boss became passive aggressive towards me, would almost ignore me and i felt uncomfortable af, my District boss was getting multiple multiple ""client complaints about me"" about things that NEVER EVER happened, i genuinely think my boss was filing them anonymously or having her friends do it because i swear on my life that i poured my heart out and gave it my all when it came to the actual work and clients, I ended up being fired the last day of January for another ""customer complaint"" a fake fucking customer complaint. My boss had worked there 14+ years and had a lot of power and sway, i don;t know what i ever did to her. I admit i was immature and high on love and life at first but when she checked me on it i straightened up the same second. After being fired everything went downhill, covid quarantine started, I lost contact with most of my friends, i ended up being kicked out from my house , didn't re-enroll in school( still haven't), gained all the weight back and more, got diagnosed with an physical illness, got put on strong ati anxiety/depression meds that did not work, and did not work for a year exactly due to being in a state that was heavily impacted by Covid. I started working again 2 months ago and things are getting better i guess or though i thought so but i still feel so empty, i feel so lonely and depressed, i see a couple friends here and there but it doens't make a difference on how i feel, it just isn't the same, my fiance and i haven't seen each other in almost 2 years ( will be 2 years in August) because of Covid, I don't think I will be able to see him this summer in person either France is closed off. I am grateful to have a job and make money ( i was in bed crying everyday for a whole hear) but my new job is so fucking miserable, all i do is stare at a computer and everybody is 40 years older than me, every day is the same. Everyday is predictable. I miss my Chanel job so much, i miss having a best friend i would see all the time, i miss the excitement of the beginning of my relationship i miss my fiance flirting with me and being in awe over me ( we've been together a couple years now long distance and it feels like we've been married for 10 years) , i miss the happy beautiful me who had spark in her eyes, my eyes have no life in them now, i don't feel excited about anything, everyday is numb, i don't get pleasure from anything. Nothing to look forward to, even when i make plans i feel nothing, i feel like a part of me or all of me died this last year and a half. I miss the person i used to be i miss my life, I turn 21 this month and i just feel nothingness, is it really just downhill from here ? Am i crazy? What happened? I am back with my parents and i am happy to be around my siblings again, my parents and i's relationship was never good it was mostly abusive and it probably will never be good, i am going to restart school in the fall i hope but i dont know wtf i am going to do - i was planning law and fiance but that just seems like a dreadful career, good money yes but fucking boring. I love my fiance but i wish he would just man up sometimes and take some of the weight off my shoulders at time just like i do for him. I don't know anymore. I'm sorry for rambling i just want my life back, the old me back, my old job back. I am fucking dead inside. Is this just life. is this just adult hood and i am just stuck on the life i had at 18/19.

I give up.,"I can't lose weight. It's so hard and I just can't do it anymore. I've been stuck at my highest weight for months on end not able to lose a pound. I live with my parents and don't have money to buy my own food so I'm subject to all the shitty food they buy and cook. They barely buy fresh fruits and vegetables. It's all meat and processed junk. So I discovered CICO and thought it would work. Nope. I ate 500 calories a day for a week and didn't lose a single pound. I try working out an hour everyday, but everytime my body crashes after 20 minutes and I can't go on. It's hard trying to move around in 162 pound body at 5'1. To make matters worse I have a vacation with all my skinny friends coming up in a couple of weeks and I'm still fucking fat. They never pointed out my weight, but I'm tired of being the fat friend or the silent judgment I feel from their parents when they open the door everytime I come over. Their eyes say, ""How could parents let their child get so big?"" Everyone in my family is obese or overweight. Several have high blood pressure and diabetes on both sides. It's so bad I had to get tested for diabetes at 9 and thankfully it came back negative. I remember the doctor telling my mom bluntly that I was overweight and needed to lose some pounds, but she ignored it and told me they were being mean to me while in the car...I wish she would've listened to them instead of carrying on like usual. She was morbidly obese and had to have weight loss surgery herself when I was a child. She lost a lot of weight and is still far from a healthy weight herself.

I've hated my body since I was in middle school and still do as a sophomore in college. I'll always hate my body and never love it. When I was in highschool I was 130 pounds and hated my body still. Now I would give anything to go back to that weight. Only 2 pair out of 7 pairs of jeans fit. I have to squeeze into my what used to be ""fat safety clothes."" Clothes I would wear if I was feeling fat. Everything fits me horribly now and I just cover it up with a big jacket. I've been depressed the last two years too. I just hate my body so much. I avoid pictures. I scrutinize and pick apart everything I hate about my body in the mirror everyday. I constantly weigh myself to see if I've changed only to be disappointed everytime. I'd never thought I'd get this heavy, but here I am. Everytime I gain weight, I never lose it. Everytime I pack on pounds that's my official new weight. I haven't been able to lose five pounds in three or four years. It's awful. Everyone tells me I'm fine and to love myself, but I don't want to love myself at this weight. I refuse to. I want to be thin and pretty. I want to be more attractive. I feel so fucking disgusting and fucking hate myself. The body positive movement is the worst thing that could've happened to society. Being fat is not okay. It poses health risks and makes you feel shitty about yourself all the time. You're not able to wear cute clothes. You're always worried about how you look and how others perceive you. It's hell and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I'd rather be depressed and skinny than fat and depressed. Trust me, being depressed and fat is way worse than the latter. 

I want to go on vacation and have fun, but the fact I will have to do so in my fat body makes me feel awful. I've lost hope on losing weight and if I did start to lose weight it probably would take me 3-5 years to lose 30 pounds. I'm not ready to dedicate 3-5 years to losing 30 pounds. I mentally am not prepared to do that but hopefully one day.",AnalysisSubstantial1,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6hhj0/i_give_up/

Too lazy to work. Can't will myself. Want to write. Want to die. Hate life. Want to die. Want to die. Hate life. Want to die.

I feel the more and more I return to this place to talk, the less and less I have to talk about. This sickness still eats away at my soul and body, but it leaves me nothing in return; it doesn't so much as defecate, only devour. I feel invalid, for having nothing else to talk about, and selfish, for struggling with these problems so long but not having anything to show for it. 

It's the exact same shit, the exact same every single day. There has to be something, some tumour this vile fucking cancer has spawned in my brain that I can identify and scoop out, but it's hiding deep in there. I can't reach it, I can't see it, I have to deal with its side effects and it's the same every day. The continuous waste, the lethargy, the lack of will, the feeling that I'm better off dead. Better off dead for everyone else, and better off dead for myself because I'll never get anywhere.

If anything, I'm the cancer. I suck from my superiors, my parents, my background, my government, my therapist, I suck EVERYONE'S life force away but they just don't see it yet. I take, but I can't give back. I'm just destined to grow and stagnate until they all die, at which point I'll die too. I'm hopeless on my own. I'm mindless, much like a cell that doesn't know it should've died long ago.

She told me it was my fault that I couldn't keep a job,"Hi everyone, my first time writing something here. I have been depressed since I was about 12 years old. With some up and down moments. I have a useless bachelors degree and I have been doing some customer service support works (retail, receptionist).

However, it seems that I cant hold a job, due to the stress, low salary and sometimes low key bullying from my bosses. The longest job I could keep was my last one I stayed there for 1 year and 4 months. I had to quit because my depression and anxiety got so bad that one day I was so fatigued i couldnt get out of bed. I have been trying to get better.

Now I have an amazing opportunity, I maybe be able to purchase a house, however im scared of the debt because its a huge one and Im afraid I wont be able to pay even tho my fiancee works.

I was just talking about this with my sister-in-law and she just told me it was my fault that I couldn't keep a job, she also had to work for years on some job that she didn't like. (Although she doesn't knowledge her privilege) 

I usually quit because my bosses either started to treat me like shit, or exploited me and payed me a very low salary for the hours I was working.

It hurted my so much, I felt like a failure, a sub-human, because my mental illness weakens me so much. Im honestly feeling a bit suicidal. I do think she is right.

"Lonely, needed to vent","I moved cross country last year for work. Then covid. I'm don't feel like I'm making the personal connections I was hoping to here. I'm finally in a career position where I feel valued, but it's just not translating over into my life outside of there. Over the weekend I flew home to clear out a storage unit I'd left prior to coming out here. Barely even had the chance to see my family because I had it in my head that I absolutely had to be back here. My family has been really fractured for a long time, and since my dad passed, I've felt truly alone in the world. I didn't need to be back so soon. Drove 2000 miles in 2 1/2 days. I could've spent that time with my family and just left all that stuff there.

Maybe I'm just weepy and miserable from the lack of sleep, but it's making me assess my life and my options at the moment. My job is starting to transition me over to a hybrid in office/work from home schedule. I could switch to remote work entirely, but then I'd just be really alone here, and it would limit my upward mobility within the office environment. Also, if I'm working remotely, I could legitimately just go home and do it. But I just renewed my lease for another year here, and then I'd be stuck moving everything again like I just did.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like the first thing I should do is get out of this funk I'm in (it'll probably take a few days), and then maybe see about some kind of short term counseling or a support system so my job performance isn't affected and I comfortable enough to start inquiring about my job's long term plans for me.

I did learn some things about myself (main issues are social/financial) and learned to notice when my thinking was more distorted than realistic (though I also learned that my own negative thoughts aren't the only part of the equation, despite what CBT therapy might suggest). Tried some meditation and exercise which had very slight benefits. I constantly make stupid mistakes though, and I suck at speaking clearly and holding conversations, let alone getting people to be receptive to attempted jokes or stories (not that I try anymore).

That said, I used to be passably social/normal at first glance with effort, and I had friends (but never a girlfriend). That charade became too exhausting though, and it never became any easier or less anxiety-inducing. Most people would clue in eventually to my anxiety/weirdness and treat me differently/disregard me. For various different reasons, each friendship faded away (including 1 from childhood), and I haven't had any friends online or offline for a few years now. I was also tired of the social competition and the jockeying for better social standing (not that I partook much since I was usually more quiet). I'd probably feel differently if I was one of the socially competent people.

My negative sentiment towards socializing might not necessarily follow from this premise, but I think it's accurate to say socializing is about proving your worth. I'm sick of being judged though, most of all by myself. I think that's why I've been holed up in my house (no exaggeration) 90% of the time these last 7 years. I'm absolutely miserable and lonely, and yet that's preferable to being around others. To paraphrase some dead guy, hell is other people. Anyways, that's my sob story.

just wanted to tell cause i know someone gonna hear it this time,"I've been dealing with depression and social anxiety since I was little. My mother was a devout and always raised me as if I was in a box so I didn't know many things, I didn't know what people were talking about. My mother was dressing me, I was acting as my mother said. That's why I started being bullied in 5th grade, by people I was friends with. Because I was making friends so hard, I did all their errands so that i won’t lose them. My teachers pulled me over and always said stop being friends with them, that's how I got rid of them and transferred from that school.

Then my favorite cousin wanted to touch me. He tried to manipulate me to touch me, threatened me, and since he was the only cousin who played with me, I kept my voice again. I still hate myself for that, I wanna kill myself for that. Even tho I know I was a child, I still hate it. Then I suddenly pulled myself out of the whole world. My family was never worried about me, they only wanted to see my old self who did everything they want. Many times I thought of killing myself. Once I hurted myself, then I realized I was afraid of dying.
I started to get rid of my mother's terror and express my own ideas in the 9th grade. My mother took me to the doctor, but I found a reason and left it constantly. At school, my teachers thought I was mute. For the first time in years, I made a new friend. It was difficult for her because I didn't seem willing at all. She’s still my best friend now. I thought I was saved. I slowly started talking to people in the 11th grade. I was still shaking when talking to someone. I was getting off the subway before my own stop just because it was crowded. I thought everyone was laughing at me.

I made a new friend from school again. When they were with me I was able to act outside as if I had no anxiety. I started to feel free. My depression triggering me lessened. This time I thought I really got off. My shaking stopped, I started talking to people online.
I still have trouble talking to people and I look awkward. I want to make friends. I’m scared to show my real self, my feelings. Whenever I asked for a help about my mental health, they always said “It’s gonna be okay.” They didn’t care and kept going ranting about their life as if nothing happened. I’m so tired. I feel like an empty shell.

I am now in the first year of university. I can't think of my future. I don't know what to do, how to fix myself. I want to be normal. I want to have a talent or do something for people. I'm tired of being a piece of shit with no use. I want to have friends, laugh. I want to be successful. I wanna turn back and fix everything I did. That’s all.

"Just one of those days (Dark thoughts, some mention of suicide to follow)","Not having a great time. I typically manage to obscure (from myself) the fundamental truth that I do not find my life worth living and doubt that I ever will. But today the veil has slipped, as occasionally it does, and so here I am to vent again. 

In short, I have a lack of desire for what life offers, and an excess of aversion for what life offers. Further, much of what I am averse to is rather important and what I desire I am ill equipped to obtain.

Years of isolation have left people increasingly ""unreal"" to me. By this, I mean that basically the only person in my life who I like is my therapist, and I think this is wearing on my capacity for empathy/interest in healthy relationships with others. The idea that I could ever find and sustain romantic love is alternately a distant dream and a cruel joke. Finding and sustaining friendship seems increasingly problematic as well. Indeed it starts to seem like the only sort of benefit I could acquire reliably from people would be self-satisfaction from feeling superior to them. 

This is of course the inverse of what I actually feel, as I regard myself as a failure in essentially every respect. I am simply losing faith, as it were, in the possibility of sustained feelings outside of what regularly comprises the grim emotional realities of my diseased mind. I believe life is cold and shitty, and thus I'm losing the ability to hope for anything other than an inverse of my current self-created hierarchy where everything is still cold and shitty, but at least I'm at the top looking down instead of at the bottom looking up.

This is of course manifestly unhealthy, and terribly unlikely to happen, to boot. Accomplishment requires effort, and I have very little effort I am willing to give. Simply accepting this life is a loss for me and dying frankly seems far more reasonable at times like this.

As always, I am in no danger of actually attempting suicide in the immediate future. Even if my resistance has been slowly dwindling over the years, I am not there yet and have a few concrete ideas for big risks I could plausibly take that might change my life for the better (or...screw it up further) that would at least be worth rolling the dice on if I came to the point that I was seriously at the end of my rope. 

But yes, today is not a good day for me, though my therapist's job security continues to look fantastic.

Days like this I wish I could simply have a new game+ experience with life. Alas, my (tenuously held, I admit) Christian belief system seems to pretty clearly indicate that such a thing is not in the cards. Pity. I have not yet lost hope in human life itself. I imagine it might actually be pretty great.

Can’t Shake This Feeling,"I (21F) was recently seeing someone (32M). This isn’t a relationship sob story, but some of the stuff he said has stuck.

I'm not good enough and don't know how to fix my life,"I've been unemployed since I graduated in the midst of the first wave of lockdowns. I was so happy and excited to enter workforce and stop scraping by on student allowance/loan, but instead I'm now scraping by on unemployment benefits.

After the first few rejections I figured I just don't have enough experience writing applications, so I read about writing resumes and motivation letters, tweaked my portfolio, thought about what to add and what to remove, just figured I can get it right and keep working on it until something takes. I have the experience from internships the school made mandatory, it's not much but it's something. Slightly above average grades, exemplary letters from internships. The counselors kept going on about how high the employment rate was on our career track.

I've applied to everything I'm even a bit qualified for in the creative fields, but regardless of if it was something I had practical experience of from the internships or if it was a posting that didn't specify that you needed a lot of experience, I've gotten exactly one interview, somehow from the posting I was least qualified for, and didn't make it to the second interview.

What's eating me alive is that I don't know what's wrong. I don't know what I'm missing. Even the jobs welcoming fresh graduates pass me by. At this point I get close to a panic attack seeing openings and have passed a couple without applying because I don't know why I'm not good enough. Every time I try to think of something to make to bolster my portfolio with at least personal projects if not paid ones, I get so anxious I can't get started even picking what to work on. Nothing I do is working. Nothing is good enough.

People tell me to send cold applications to companies who are not advertising openings but my anxiety is so severe that I can't. At least when replying to postings I know what to say and what they are looking for, and even then I don't know why I wasn't even chosen to be interviewed. I have a suspicion it might be because I've never been active on social media because of my lifelong anxiety issues, so my name doesn't really return any results, but it doesn't feel fair either. I have samples of my work and the paperwork from school and the internships. Putting myself out there just gets harder the more I try.

I don't know what to do at this point, I'm burnt out and thinking about working on anything creative forms a lump in my throat. But after spending days, weeks avoiding job sites and work I then feel like a lazy piece of shit, it's my own fault no one hires me if I can't get better. Every piece or project I create feels worse than the last. I can't even call myself a fresh graduate anymore after a year of unemployment. The longer the gap the worse it looks. But if I need work experience to get work experience, what am I supposed to do? I can't afford to go back to school nor do I want to change career track before even starting the one I already worked so hard for to get a degree in. 

I just want to give up.

I listened to a former classmates Podcast and he spoke bad things about me. I feel so low now.,"Hey all,

Some context, I was not a very sociable person in high school. I didn’t have many friends, but still felt a desire to be part of a group and to “fit in”. Myself and my best friend (who I love like a brother and we are still friends to this day) used to hang out with a group of guys, who I will say, weren’t really the nicest bunch. I hung out with one of them in class and found him funny, but then the relationship changed and I realized he was quite toxic and abusive. 

One day we hung out at my place when they decided to screw around. My parents weren’t home and they wrestled me and stuck my head in a toilet. 

I didn’t realize they filmed it and uploaded it on the internet. The funny thing is, the act itself didn’t traumatize me, it was the relentless teasing I received afterwards. People taunted and teased me almost everyday. They believed that I “volunteered to do it” and that I was “disgusting” and “had AIDS”. They would ask me “Why did you do it” and refuse to listen if I insisted that I was forced. I weirdly find myself believing this up til today, even though I know better.

There was this one guy who I was in a few classes with. He was popular and well-liked among everyone, he also wasn’t the WORST to me compared to others. Just the usual “why did you do it” as established earlier, and the odd bit of condescending remarks here and there. He’s now in my country, established himself as a podcaster and comedian, with a bit of a following and he’s also chummy with a few bigger stars now.

I at least managed to forget about all until the other day when I got thinking about this comedian, and decided to try listening to one of his podcasts. He ended up touching on high school, and told these other guys about me and the group I was in. He went on about how we’d “give each other swirlies” and how we “bullied each other only” and how everyone else in high school were all good to each other. 

I don’t know why, but hearing all this made my stomach sick and I can’t help but think about it for the last few days. It’s a total lie, he has NO IDEA what I went through, stuff which he joined in on. 
I don’t want to go back to those days, I just want to move on. Why did I have to listen to this? I haven’t been able to sleep, because when I do I’m reminded of it all again.",Jusmumbo1,44,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5weox/i_listened_to_a_former_classmates_podcast_and_he/

He walked away and I didn’t know why he was upset. But even then I didn’t text him when I should have. Cause we are friends that do that sort of stuff.

Anecdotally, I’ve been and seen a lot of shit (suicides, parents dying etc) but I’m pretty numb to most stuff and can just turn it off so to speak. The only thing that hurts me now is when a relationship fails and thats when things get a little wonky because its the only thing I can’t cope with. I’m wondering if anyone else is the same in that regard.",TurntPikachu,1,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6iibf/do_you_guys_think_lack_of_or_failed_relationships/

Stuck in a muddy circular rut,"So, here's where I'm at.  Ranty, but it is what it is.

I have a disabled child I'm trying to raise and teach, who's wonderful and stubborn and maddening.  I have a mostly physically disabled SO who I love, but whose contributions to the relationship and the parenting can be called minimal most days.  I've moved up in my career, but I've hit a point where I'm great at understanding things and abysmal at explaining them, especially all documented and official like.  I'm an introvert fighting depression and social anxiety while being cooped up at home and slowly going nuts because there is no quiet time, even though I get me time.  My home is a disaster area.  There are chores I need to get done and tasks I *want* to get done and finding the energy to push forward anything is like Sisyphus and a certain rock.  And I do it as much as I can, because any other approach seems worse.  

Things seemed to be getting better for a while.  Mostly because I got acknowledgement that I had problems that needed help too, and for a while, got that help.  Now I'm just treading water in this grey area where I can't tell anymore what's an internal problem I need to fight and an external one I need to fix.  My SO probably means well, in many things they do, but I'm seeing so many double standards that it's hard not to break down and call them out as a hypocrite.  There's so much focus on their physical suffering, into their needs and wants, half as much on our kid's, and if I'm having a hard time, it's a concern, just never at either level.  I'm doing what I can to help heal other men's sins, I know nothing would ever be ""enough"", but it's important to me that I try, but it's just as important to feel like something somewhere does some good.  Trying to see all sides and it's just turning into mud.

I want to be depressed because I think I will become a worse person if I'm not.,"Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to use people for my own enjoyment.

I don't want to work for mysterious goals I don't understand.

I don't want to be happy about being the universe's plaything.

I don't want to get a high from having strength enough to do their dirty work and some drug's making me give them my smile so they can laugh at me enjoying it.

I don't want to talk like happy people do when they ignore what life can be and how everything we regard as good is the source of everything bad.

I don't want to feel desperate about life when it's only going to be more painful.

I don't want to join the team that has helped me feel this bad.

I don't want to have gone through this all just to become the lowest of the low in the happy hierarchy.

I don't want to be able to start a family and gamble with lives.

I don't want to worship the indifference.

I don't want to become all high and mighty.

I don't want to like drugs.

I don't want to feel like things are good for me when I know the best thing is death.

"Therapy seems like an odd solution to me, considering I've never been unconditionally loved","You could sum up many of my problems as having parents who didn't really love me - they wanted me to be someone to serve their own needs. They wanted me to be rich and ""successful"" for example. Now for someone who has a huge deficit in receiving unconditional love, the idea of therapy seems depressing. I'm supposed to talk to someone who'll only want to talk to me if I pay them for it? And this person is going to be talking to 1000 different clients, perhaps with wildly different needs and interests? That doesn't sound too different from my childhood in essence. The therapy center I'm waitlisted at even proudly advertises itself as ""helping everyone from all walks of life"" - that's great and all, woohoo. Is there anything in society that isn't one-size-fits-all?

how do people get past this???,"I geniunely don't get it. I've been severely depressed for years. I'm 19 now and my last attempt and hospitalization was in December. The last few years have been awful. Even more than the last few. Growing up in general. Extreme social anxiety and now general anxiety with panic attacks. Hell, I've gone through over 50 courses of ECT treatment (which if you don't know, is electroconvulsive therapy where a seizure is induced with electrical impulses to change the way your brain functions) and somewhere around 12 hospitalizations. Now I'm struggling with extreme derealization and dissociation on top of the depression. (I have borderline personality disorder as well. I have no sense of self. I feel absolutely hollow.) I can't even get out of bed. Back in October, I had pnemonia from laying in bed for days and days on end. How do people get past depression? Why is it so hard for me to simply be happy? Why is it so hard for me to even feel connected and like I'm real? The only reason I'm alive is because I'm scared to die.

"At a point where I have so much to share and pour my heart out over here but I don't even have the strength or energy to do that either, and it's breaking me even more.","Reddit is one of the best things that ever happened to me. I've always been an insecure lonely only child throughout my life because of various reasons, but reddit is the only place I've ever been able to truly open up and try to release all the morbid thoughts and stuff I have bottled up.
But nowadays, I seem to not be able to do that too. I feel like crying everyday at totally random moments nowadays, and hardly speak more than 500 odd words a day. Im starting to see morbidity in everything around me and given I'm already at rock bottom rn in my personal life because of various reasons, all these are just adding up. I'm going to sleep at 6am everyday coz I just end up staring at the ceiling all day long. 

And I don't even have the energy or will to post them on reddit anymore. I want to get so many thoughts of my chest but I can't seem to even articulate any of it nowadays or gather the will nd strength to post it.

And that's breaking me even more. Posting on reddit was the one small thing that used to give me joy nd a sense of a safety net, but even that's proving way too hard for me.

I really resent them for making me exist and for raising me with no work ethic or responsibilities. I didn’t even have to do chores as a child. Im a privileged brat and i dont want to work. I just cant bring myself to care about anything and i think its because i know my needs will be met by my parents even if i dont take care of myself.

I won’t live past 35,"Hello, my name’s Brandon. (21 M) I was born with a profound hearing loss. My father was both verbally and physically abusive. I was raised by a single mother my whole life, I have three other siblings, two of them are my half siblings and I see them only around the holidays once a year. My other sibling is my sister, she has autism and hearing loss as well. We don’t really have anything in common, she moved out of the house two years ago and now has a kid. It’s just me and my mom now. 

I grew up with kids who had hearing loss just like me and I went to school with them my whole life. In middle school I transferred over to a mainstream school with a bunch of other kids who were considered as “normal” or had regular hearing. I struggled making friends growing up, I took special education classes my whole life, I excelled in all of them but once I got to college that was when things took a huge turn. I suffered a concussion during my first year of college while playing football, after that I started to fail majority of my classes and eventually I had to drop out after my first year. 

Then the pandemic hit. I bounced around from working in a restaurant to working at Home Depot and now to working as a sprinkler fitter apprentice. My coworkers don’t get what it’s like to suffer with depression, they’ll ask me if I’m alright or whenever I’m having a bad day they’ll ask if I’m okay and when I do tell them. They just tell me to man up instead. 

I honestly do not know what I want to do with my life, I’ve always wanted to raise a family of my own but I don’t see it happening anymore. I don’t feel normal and I don’t think I ever will. I currently take antidepressants, I have had anger management therapy growing up and have had therapy for my depression throughout high school. Nothing helped. 

I’ve decided that once I hit 35 years old and that I’m not going to be a burden to anyone once I take my own life. I do not want to leave this world and hurt my friends and my mom. I love them incredibly and I want to see them all succeed and live a happy life. I just don’t see myself sticking around for long.

don’t go on tinder until your brain is fixed,"ok so I thought I’ve been feeling better lately so I made a horrible attempt to step out of my comfort zone and chat with people on tinder. eventually a guy asked me if I wanted to hang out and I was super nervous beforehand but it seemed like it all went well and for a hot second I almost felt like, i dunno, a normal person capable of experiencing joy of communication but OBVIOUSLY that didn’t last lol. we didn’t chat or meet in person after that so I’ve spent the last several days thinking what I could’ve done wrong and scrutinising every single thing I said and the way I looked and the way I must’ve come across - and I feel like the shallowest, blandest person to have ever lived and also a catfish since I picked the most decent photos for tinder and probably look near repulsive irl.
i understand i’m probably being too harsh on myself and that it’s not normal to go obsessed like that over a person I’ve met once, but the thing is I’m also disappointed in myself in a new way now since I had thought I’d be able to handle the whole situation in my head in a better, healthier way. apart from that my BDD intensified too and although sometimes I feel the urge to actually put some effort in to improve my looks, the next minute all I want is just to seize to exist so that I’ll never have another person see that pathetic ugly mess that I am

Can I talk to someone about this? Read down below,"I got a lot off scars beqause I had a heart operation. On my troath are scars too. Basicly, my whole body have 25  scars from suggerys only. I wasn't  ashamed off it , unttill a year ago. I put out my shirt in front off my  friend and she told me it was weird and looked Ugly.  I got sad and felt realy insecure about them afterwards. Every time she sleeps over, I hold on my long sleeves. With sex, I keep on my shirt too. She doesnt want to do me..beqause off my scars..so I only do her on her commands.  She doesnt even want too kiss me or touch mine body.. (whats wrong with me? I must be disgusting).  It got even so far I hide my scars in public too. I feel discust from them, specially the burned cuts on my whrists (that one I did myself so I blame myself for those scars). 
I finally gained some trust back, that my body was okay how it was when my personal trainer messurd mine height and saw them. He said that I was survivor, and a fighter and dont need to be ashamed off them.  He said that I was a strong kid.
I smiled and decided it was true. For a while I didnt put on my long sleeves anymore and was truly happy about myself.  I did saw myself as a survivor for once! Until my ex best friend maked a comment when he saw me half naked and Asked me why I had those ugly scars and didnt just had a normal body. I teard up in front off him and screamed in his face that I had a heart suggery and cant help about it that I got those. I sort off broke down in his room. I got a panick attack, and the weird thing is..he kissed me in the middel of the attack. And my scars too. He said they were fine and he was just sorry. It messed up my brain. I never liked guys tough, he was the first one I had some feelings for, but he left me to just like the rest off mine relationships.  And 
I dont know what to do on this point..Every person I was once with in a relationship found my scars ugly , and know this friend to. Maybey I just keep cover them up..i thinks it is safer.

Signed off sick from work due to anxiety and depression. No choice but to go back on Monday because I need the money. I feel so lost and frustrated right now.,"This sucks.

I was signed off originally a couple of weeks ago. I have an app thing which allows me to contact my GP without phoning/making a face-to-face appointment, so I updated her on the whole situation and told her my anxiety was feeling a little better due to combination of meds and being off work. She then said it was a good idea to further my sick leave.

I agreed originally. Then I realised I'd only be getting £95 PER WEEK sick leave. That's not even enough to cover my rent.

So I'm heading back to work on Monday when I do not feel ready mentally. I hate the place. I hate the coworkers. Before I signed off sick I ended up having several panic attacks before and after the shifts. The job itself can be so damn stressful because of the speed and monotony (it's a factory where things very often go wrong).

I don't want to go back, but I have no choice. I asked my doctor if I could go back before my sick leave ended and you could tell even she doesn't think it's a good idea. But I honestly have no bloody choice.

What to do when you hate everything about your life?,"Too broke to even distract myself with impulse purchases anymore, hate where I live. Miss where I used to live. Miss my friends. I don’t have any anymore. I gave them up and cannot get them back when they were trying to warn me the whole time. Hate my relationship, he makes me stay and made me quit my old job. I genuinely loved it. He says he feels suicidal without me. I used to get jealous because he would do the most horrible things behind my back, just downright greasy. And continues to. Just unloyal. But I don’t get jealous anymore. I hope I find impulse validation like that. I hope I find love. I want it so bad. 

I don’t have any thing in common with him. My old friend who was a cops son dropped me off at the wrong house on purpose when I got shit faced on my 21st. I went to jail and have been on probation ever since. My current boyfriends mother was my community service clerk and I felt like I owed it to him to stay. I tried to break up many times. I now no longer try. He had me move out of my spot on the coast with the job I loved. Now I work as a night audit. I was a bartender. I work all the time in a uniform in 80 degree heat. I don’t even post him. 

He blew up my cars engine, told me he didn’t. That car was my pride and joy. Told me to stop crying cuz it’s not his fault. He kept driving with no oil... I would’ve towed it home. He bought me a new Toyota Corolla, the year I wanted (94). But we both had to sign on it. Now I am more trapped. 

My little brother is being abused. I don’t have any family so I had to forgive my parents for what they did to me. I can’t get him out of the situation he’s in. My parents love my boyfriend. 

I hate you for everything you did and continue to do. I don’t even feel anything. I am emotionless. I’m a slave to the courts. I am a slave to you. And I hope you’re fine with me existing as a guilt ridden emotionless nothing. I am just nothing. 

I got pregnant and had to get rid of it. I could not handle it. Just mishap after mishap.

"I Fell Off, Flop Era","I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about a decade, but this morning and week have been difficult. Mornings have become increasingly difficult over the past year. My depression, anxiety, lack of gratitude, and overall selfishness caused me to destroy the most important relationships i had. I wake up with the guilt of how i destroyed those relationships, although mutuals think we were both at fault for destroying it. They seemed to have moved on from our relationships, and im stuck within the rut. One is an ex who broke up with me, but still reaches out when they feel low because they feel as if i know how to be there for them. it’s a trip and makes me feel horrible, but i want to be there for them because i still love them a lot. 

I have been unemployed (mostly by choice) because i wanted to focus on personal projects, but i haven’t had the confidence to believe stay focused, and i have felt too overwhelmed and shut down during the process of working. I feel inauthentic within everything and feel very isolated while working because i don’t feel the support i’m looking for. Although i have a few closer friends remaining and family, none feel entirely great to talk to because i think i forgot how to connect with people after all those other relationships ended.

I could try to connect with “new” people, i have many loose friends (who were closer in the past, but i haven’t spoke to many people since the start of covid), but i fear reaching out because it’s been so long, and i don’t want to burden anyone with my draining energy. I feel like the only part of my identity that’s remaining is negativity. I don’t want to just dump my emotions onto people. Also i don’t know what feels good, or bad anymore when connecting. I feel out of place everywhere because i don’t know who i am, so i shrink into myself. how do i get myself out there to connect without having these thoughts? 

i feel like a loser because i feel as if i’m good enough at what i do. im in my twenties, and was positioned to do well within my industry (art and media). My work used to feel amazing, but now it feels horrible. i’m letting all the traction i’ve built continuously die. Everyone I know is propelling and working on amazing projects, but i feel stuck in my tracks. I wake up and go into my studio to work for almost 10 hrs a day, but nothing ever comes and I end up spacing out. Everyday passing unproductive day is further discouraging because i truly desire to work but it proves to me that i’m not able to. capitalism has me drained. 
 
this was a pointless rant, i don’t know if i made any sense. i just wanted to vent even though i vent about this constantly in therapy. i feel guilty because they’re so many bigger things to focus on but i’m constantly stuck within this world inside my head. sigh",nothisisnotrealatall,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n67plf/i_fell_off_flop_era/

I have a house, a partner and a job. I'm well aware that there are people in far more dire circumstances, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining or feeling the way I am, but knowing that doesn't seem to help.

I'm in my mid 30's now and the prospect of another 35 years of work, planning, scheduling, filing, organising and just trying to tread water doesn't seem worth it.

I spend less and less of my time doing things I enjoy, and when I do, I feel anxious about whether there's something important I ought to be doing instead. I used to enjoy creative writing and was able to get a couple of short stories published, but I never have the energy or the enthusiasm to do that any more. 

I want to be able to wander off into the middle of nowhere and live out my days somewhere with minimal contact with the world - not asking anything of anyone, and not be asked anything myself in exchange. Somewhere quiet, where I don't need to explain myself to anyone or be responsible for anything or anyone besides myself and my own immediate needs. I miss the freedom to get lost in my own thoughts.

I feel like the world is organised and controlled by people who prioritise ""being productive"" over any other aspect of life, and for those of us who don't feel that way there's little choice aside from trying to drive a square peg into a round hole. 

More than anything else, I feel like I want to be left alone, which seems like a pretty modest request, but it's one that the world can't seem to accommodate",jammyjamjams2021,6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n63kiw/i_want_to_disappear/

I want my friend back,"My best friend of 5 years cut me off 3 years ago and I still think about him constantly. Not in a sus way. He was like my other half. I could be real with him and he could be real with me. The problem is, he was always jealous of me. Girls would gravitate towards me, specifically, girls he LIKED would gravitate towards me. He was a self conscious guy so it hit hard a lot. He's really socially awkward, and all that and I wasn't. I know I sound narcissistic, i'm just trying to relay what he had told me in the past so you guys can understand. A lot of the time, he hated me, not because i'm a terrible person, but because he hated himself. He always wanted to try and find ways he could change himself. I didn't really try to help him because I thought he was great just how he was. Anyways, here's the big spill. Basically, around 3 years ago, me and him both went through pretty terrible breakups at the same time. We came up with a plan to steal his parents alcohol. We did it and he felt guilty and told his parents. He blamed me completely. His parents started hating me and he wasn't allowed to hangout with me anymore. A couple months after that, we switched schools and stopped talking for a while. Then we started talking again and we decided to hangout at the gym, now here's the real kicker, he never actually told me he wasn't allowed to hangout with me. He got caught with me and once again blamed me. This sounds toxic on paper but there's just something about it that seems off. Anyways, that's the story.

Now my mom's in the hospital and they think it's cancer. I really need a friend right now and he's the only one that comes to mind. Should I give it one more go? I mean we're both adults now


Edit: I had a lot of the same problems as him at the time, I just wouldn't let them get to me. Being around him made me feel stronger and I always thought I did the same for him.

Diagnosis/Meds Question,"Hello all,   
A few weeks back I had a psychiatrist appointment which resulted in me being prescribed antidepressants and medicine for anxiety. What I'm confused about is if that means I was diagnosed or not. Nobody has ever outright told me that I am diagnosed with depression or anxiety (a therapist has said that it is present but still needs to be diagnosed by someone else), so I am lost on what is going on. I would assume that if I have the prescriptions then there is a diagnosis but I'm unsure.

TLDR; if I was prescribed antidepressants and anxiety meds, does that mean that I have a diagnosis?

Any advice would be appreciated,"If this turns into a long post, I'm sorry and thank you for taking the time to read it.

I (29F) WAS seeing someone (29M) for roughly 2 months. We were very open to eachother about our MH. We both suffer from depression and anxiety however I've been able to manage it the last few months whereas his has gotten worse over the year.

Everything started out ""perfect"" open communication, positive attitude, fun light conversations daily. I didn't want to rush into anything as I was wary it might affect my MH. I guess the whole ""you want what you can't have"" is true because he seemed very interested and eager to hang out. Well.. fast forward I started developing feelings and when I reciprocated his feelings/attitude I guess it scared him and overwhelmed him (he didn't explain that until after we ended things).

In the last 2 weeks I've noticed he has gained a lot of weight, is sleeping all day, taking more Ativan than he used to (went from once a week to twice a day). Started smoking cigarettes again and his mood went a complete 180.

I've asked him why he suddenly doesn't want to hang out anymore/like me and he just says he doesn't know. That hes been feeling like this the past year (I'm assuming unaware of his feelings). He also said there's no point it evaluating it because he's done (with me).

I can't tell whether this is his depression and he's alienating himself from me (apparently he has a tendency to do that). Or maybe he just doesn't like ME anymore. When I ask I just get one worded answers ""yeah idk"" ""that makes sense"" ""I'm overwhelmed"" ""I'm confused"".

So my question is... Should I cut all ties like it seems he wants or should I continue to tell him I'm there for him if he needs? 

My last msg to him where I told him I wanted to be friends and if he needed anything to reach out but he completely ignored it. 

I'm trying not to waste my time as I've been known to do in the past. But I'm just going off of my own experience where I self sabotage and want the person to fight for me.

I'm contemplating reaching out to one of his best friends for advice but I feel like that makes me some crazy ex who isn't over him.

I dont think anyone truly cares anymore, either that or I've just had the worst luck imaginable I dunno. I just want this nightmare to end, as painfully as it can. I deserve the excruciating pain anyways clearly enough, atleast I can recognize that part. I may be stupid and dumb and idiotic in every other aspect, but atleast I know it.

The one person I care for the most just doesn't seem to feel the same way towards me.

I have more than a few mental issues and have struggled with self harm and suicidal ideations.
My childhood plays a big part in it.
It hurts a lot to think about. I just feel like my body doesn't even belong to me.. I feel dirty in my own skin, I can feel them touching me and staring at me even though I never see them anymore.
They were my childhood friends. I call them BAS.
Their were three of them, they were girls. They're all roughly 5ish years older than me.. it's really confusing to me. I grew up with them (I don't see or talk to them anymore) and I have these two different versions of them living in my head.
One where they were always there for me, watching out for me, making me happy and listening to me when I needed it. Helping me stay away from the loneliness that comes with being the youngest of five.
The other where they took advantage of me, my admiration for them, my desire to fit in with them. Making me do things I didn't like or understand even though they had to know it was wrong..
I dont know which one is the real them, which one to remember and focus on. The good, the bad. I think the bad outweighs the good but I dunno. They did some pretty terrible things. Maybe I'll make another post explaining what all they did if anyone's interested at all. I just need some advice.
I dont know how to feel or what to do. My body feels like its against me, it doesn't belong to me. It's just something's that's been used and abused by them, me, and so many others.

Sometimes I feel angry I was betrayed, but mostly, these days I only feel sad. Throughout the years you were trying to be a good friend, and yes, you hurt me a few times, but you never meant to.

Even all the abuse you suffered at his hands, when you came back, despite all your damage, and despite everything we had been through, I could see you were trying your best to be a good friend…

So…what happened? Did you finally give up? What made you betray my trust? What made you treat me so horribly? Why’d you defend your friend when he was in the wrong? 

Some nights I feel like I can almost understand you. We’re the only ones responsible for our own happiness, right? So maybe you just did what you did because it made you happy…it sounds selfish, but it made you happy so I guess it was worth it right?

You told me you just wanted to move on. But do you even have anything to move on from? You told me you wanted to help take away my pain…to make me happy again despite all the trauma I’d endured…or at the very least, you would try. So in the end, what are you really moving on from? I lost my best friend, my love never even had a chance, and my trust has been shattered yet again.

This is not the first time I’ve been abandoned, so why did I think it’d be different? Falling in love with you gave me hope again, that maybe we could be happy together…and once again, hoping gets me hurt. Dreams aren’t real, and life isn’t fair.

At the very least, I know you are happy now. You accused me of simply wanting your love for myself. You said you knew what I really wanted…but I always told you what I wanted was for you to be happy, and now you finally are. You will never find out, but I will always keep my word. Even after all the pain you’ve caused me? I want you to be happy, and I hope it lasts forever. I love you. Always.

Edit: more rambles incoming - you called me greedy, saying you knew what I really wanted, and implying I only loved you for selfish reasons. Except, I’m not, am I? All I wanted was a chance I never had. Life isn’t fair, I know that. Most people never get a chance with people they love, that’s just how life is. It isn’t greedy to want a fair world. It isn’t greedy to want something you can’t have.

You also called me self-righteous. You may be correct, but you still proved me right in the end. So yes, I am self-righteous, but I am also *right*.",throwaway92imsad,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n6azp4/pointless_ranting_about_love_and_life_and_oh_god/

"After two months of remission, my suicidal thoughts are back","I spent most of 2020 wanting to kill myself, largely as a result of crushing anxiety about the political situation in the United States (no need to go into the details there). After a brief period of blessed peace in March-April, I'm right back into panic again. It's not totally clear what triggered it, but every single day is a miserable slog, waiting for everything to fall apart. I'm terrified every day of violence, division and social collapse.  


I really don't want to hear 'focus on the now.' I can't live my whole life in the present moment. I have to make plans and set goals. I have to look six months, two years, five years ahead.

Feeling depressed. I’m just so tired.,"I’ve been told by multiple people to go see a therapist but I can’t seem to urge myself to initiate the annoying process of finding one. I equate this process to dating and I just don’t have the patience for that. I’m not professionally diagnosed as having depression, but I feel like I’ve been this way for a very long time, ever since high school when I attempted suicide for the first time.
These episodes of severe to mild depressing moods come and go. I’ve been suffering from insomnia and it’s affecting my daily life. I’m constantly tired at work. I list daily things to do that barely get crossed off because I just don’t have the energy to complete them.
I’m the type to reminisce a lot about the past and every time I come out feeling even more depressed af. I’m a disappointment to my parents and to myself with the string of fck ups in my past. And I haven’t done much now to improve myself. 
I picture life like a game. Like that Black Mirror Bandersnatch film. Except unfortunately reality doesn’t allow us to rewind and choose again. Whatever life decision we choose, whether it’s for the best or for the worst, we have to live with the consequences. And I’m struggling with this. I know I shouldn’t dwell in the past and beat myself over all the regretful decisions I’ve made. But I can’t help it. It brings me down so much. I’m scared to look forward and change because what if I fck up again? I know that I’m not progressing as an individual by thinking this way, but I feel so stuck. I’m not getting any younger. And that depresses me too. I see everyone including myself getting older, getting that gray hair and wrinkles - people moving on with their lives. And that depresses me. I feel I’m stuck clinging to the past and getting left behind in the dust.

"I've been depressed the past 4 years and haven't told anyone, what do I do now?","the past few years, I've been feeling less happy as time goes on. I keep telling myself—and others—that I'm doing better, but I don't really know how long it will last. I guess I've just sort of been ""suppressing"" everything, and I have a fuck ton of built up stress and frustration. I've started considering shoplifting small things like phone chargers and gift cards, since I've always found the thrill of stealing to be fun, especially when it's something very small. I can't help but feel, though, that I'm gonna be caught and get sent to juvie or something. my mental state has gradually been getting worse and worse, but I just feel like it's too late to turn my life around at this point, and that no one will help me.

Lockdown in March 2020 was a relief for me because at the time I felt like I couldn't keep up with everyone else around me. It seemed like everyone had it all together - friends, job, reputation, money, travel etc. The lives of everyone around me had a pulse. Mine didn't, I felt like I was stuck in the mud. Lockdown forced everyone to stop trying to get ahead and one up each other. I didn't feel so alone in my loneliness anymore. I thought I had a chance to catch up, I wasn't able to take 'full' advantage of the time though. But now lockdown is ending. Everyone is ready to resume their lives.

"I’m tired of everything. Fuck my health, family, life, everything. I’ll be stuck until i die.","There’s too much happening that i can’t handle and i’m sick of everything but part of me doesn’t want to be okay. 

I’ve (19F)  been to the ER about 7 times since the pandemic started. I had a huge 23cm long tumor that i didn’t know i had until i went to the ER. I lost a lot of weight and got attached to how little i weighed even though i couldn’t recognize myself at the time. Now i just compare myself to what i looked like post-op and i am currently trying to fight the dysmorphia and eating disorder that sent me back to the ER. 
My parents are abusive and weird and no one will understand without judging. My dad doesn’t let me do things like go on a walk, do laundry, or even get the mail. He doesn’t let me touch the AC which has resulted in me going to the ER from heat strokes and passing out. I’m not allowed to feel any emotions aside from happy which i never feel, no one takes me seriously when if I’m sad, mad, or hurt. My parents use my ER trips as a way to point out how i don’t take care of myself when it’s really out of my control, they don’t realize i’m not choosing to be sick. My mom got violent with me last week and my dad blamed it on me even though i was the one hit. They don’t care about me and i don’t give a fuck about them either. I am the star child in my family and they will use me as a way to make themselves feel better when it was me that put in the work. The worst part is that i will never be free from them until they pass or i commit. 
School is a bust, i don’t care enough about anything to be passionate about in an academic setting. I’m just taking classes and i feel empty. 
My partner has their own shit going on so they’re never really around for me even thought they always say they are. But it’s understandable. Same goes for my friends and too much shit has happened in the past year that i don’t have the energy to tell them my issues when I’m gonna hear the same “I’m here for you” predictable shit. 

I’m just tired of everything and i can’t stop crying, having nightmares from trauma, triggered from being abused since i was a child, and feeling empty. I don’t want empathy, pity,to commit suicide, or to see a therapist that will tell me predictable shit that i already know. My trauma defines me and that is a fact. Without it i don’t know what i have. I just want everything to stop, I’ve been feeling stuck since i was a kid and no amount of therapy will change that. Sometimes i wish i died when i was admitted to the ER, i wouldn’t have to kill myself because my body would.",cas9er_the_ghost,4,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n61ksf/im_tired_of_everything_fuck_my_health_family_life/
Feeling like I can’t talk to anyone,"A few weeks ago, I was hospitalized because I had been feeling so depressed and suicidal. I’ve been going to therapy, and I’m trying to catch up in school... But I still have been feeling emotionally up and down.

I feel like everywhere I turn, I’m either faking a smile and a normal attitude for people I don’t know as well... Or when it comes to friends and family, I feel afraid to express how I feel (because I don’t want to worry them or make them think poorly of me). My therapist told me I could text her, but I realized I even feel guilty “dumping” my emotions on her.

I’m 20, and can’t help but feel upset at myself.. I feel like I wasted some of my precious, fun younger years being sad and treading water. I know I want change, but I feel like I don’t know where to start. I’ve been thinking of changing my major... and even considering moving to a new city.

I know that you can’t move away or run away from your problems... I already learned that the hard way when I transferred my freshman year. But I realized that when I transferred to my home state, I was making the “safe” choice instead of staying out of state like I really wanted.

Finding new ways to feel again TW,"I’ve been diagnosed for about a year and a half now but this is the first time that I’ve felt so alone. Going to university has meant that the few friends I have have drifted away and I pushed the rest away with my avoidance. If I ever do reach out to someone I end up feeling even worse because no one understands. I don’t tell my boyfriend half the stuff I’m feeling because I know that I’ll probably just end up making him feel sad and if I do start talking about how I’m feeling I just stop and change the topic. 

I have a constant stabbing in my chest and over the last few years I’ve worked through different ways of making myself feel something (SH, ED etc.) but the sadness returns. I can’t even speak to my therapist anymore because my mum doesn’t like me going to see her.

This may sound whiny but... I have no support network. I’m treading on thin ice with every single person in my life and no one understands.

Failing in Life,"Hello, I’m 22 years old and feeling depressed.

I don’t really know what to do, so I’ve decided to post here. For years I have had constant struggle every day getting out of bed and being motivated to live a normal life. I never have motivation to do anything, and I always feel guilty about it. Every night I stay up late regretting how I accomplished nothing throughout the day, I feel like a failure. Every day is like this. 

I am about to be academically suspended from my college because these past two semesters have been rough on me, as my classes were all online which was challenging. Last fall I failed all of my classes and was placed on academic probation, and this semester I did improve, but not enough. I was really looking forward to living at college next year away from home and with my friends. Now I’ll be home again next fall all alone, and that thought is daunting.

I don’t know how to get out of this rut that I’ve been stuck in for years. I would like to wake up every day without feeling anxiety and regret. I would like motivation to actually go through my day.

Any advice or kind words would be appreciated.

1. What if I fuck it up, get brain damage and ruin my life?

2. I’m not religious, but what if I’m wrong and I end up in some kind of hell?

Why are people with depression reluctant to find help?,"I’ve been feeling sad, frustrated and anxious for a long time. It has become harder for me to concentrate and getting up to do something so simple as brushing my teeth or eating a meal. I think I was holding onto a thread for months if not years, managing to suck up little happy moments here and there and burying everything else deep deep within me. But with the pandemic and isolation, the little happy moments became fewer and fewer. And after a series of unfortunate events, I feel like I hit rock bottom. 



I know everyone is different. And maybe the level of my depression is very mild, but as soon as I realised I was broken and had no idea how to put the pieces together I went to a psychologist, who after seeing my state recommended that I went to a psychiatrist ASAP. Honestly, I wasn’t even expecting it. I thought the psychologist would be enough to help, I thought it was just a couple of especially rough weeks after a series of rough months. But I was diagnosed with depression and started antidepressants just yesterday. 



There are a ton of problems I have to work through and I know the medicine won’t be enough for me to become “myself” again, to regain balance and hope, and if not joy at least return to a state of contempt. But I think I’m an exception to the general rule, I think most people don’t seek therapy or are afraid to take antidepressants. And I know it’s hard to take those steps. I barely got out of bed yesterday just because of the thought that I was now the person, so incapable of dealing with her own problems, that now needs a pill to get better. I was frozen by the thought that it was going to get a lot worse before it started to get better. But after half an hour I got up and took the pill. I’m calling friends whenever I have a panic attack or just feel like crying non-stop. I’m planning on returning to my old gym, covid be damned. 



I just want to understand why some people never seem to be able to take these steps, even when asked or begged to by loved ones. If I can’t understand this maybe I’m not even depressed. I don’t know. It just hits close to home because someone very close to me has been dealing with this disease for years and does not want to take these steps.

Sometimes people surprise you...,"I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety pretty much my entire life.  But over the last several years I've managed to get a handle on my depression.  I'm genuinely happy most of the time, though I still have a lot of issues with social anxiety and being around people in general.  But sometimes I still have bad days.  And sometimes, I have really bad days, like I did earlier today.  

I have a food addiction.  I'm not obese or anything, but I definitely need to drop about 20-30 pounds.  I've really been making an effort to eat better the past 2 months or so, but sometimes I slip.  When I got my coffee from Dunkin' Donuts this morning, I also got 2 jelly donuts, and after I finished eating them I was so angry at myself.  And from there I just went into a downward spiral.  

A couple hours later, deeply depressed &amp; hating myself, a co-worker almost bumped into me as I was walking through the office.  I've always been friendly with this particularly co-worker, but we don't really know each other and I wouldn't say we're actually ""friends"".  Anyway, without thinking about it, I said ""that's ok, I'm used to not being noticed"".  She then proceeded to ask how someone could not notice someone as tall, handsome and well-dressed as me.  I almost burst into tears and collapsed to the ground.  I explained to her that at the moment, I was in a bad place mentally &amp; emotionally.  Before today, our interactions were usually limited to ""hi"", ""bye"" or ""how's it going"".  But today, when I told her I was in a bad place, this woman talked me off a ledge.  She pulled me back from the darkness.  She couldn't have been more kind, consoling or understanding of what I was going through.  She explained that she had a son who has similar issues with depression and she told me she truly understood what I was feeling.  She told me that if I ever needed to talk to someone, I could always come to her.  I was blown away, and I had a smile on my face the rest of the day.

I always expect the worst from people.  I always think that everyone is laughing at me or talking about me behind my back.  I automatically assume that people are either going to ignore me or treat me like garbage.  But sometimes people surprise you.  I really need to remember that.

What did I do wrong? I was supposed to do good in high school which I kinda did, I was supposed to do well in college which I did a little bit I guess. But then after that life is supposed to be great right?

Lack of motivation in the workplace... or laziness?,"Why does it almost feel inevitable for this wave of depressive symptoms to hit? 

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, I've been at a new job for the past few months (it's a sales job so looots of anxiety there) and I love what I do. Except lately, I just have had no motivation. I clock in and then go back to sleep for another hour or so and then feel guilty about my ""time theft."" I am so lazy in my day-to-day work where I do the bare minimum and then call it a day once my 8.5 hours are up. I *want* to do better though which is the big conflict in my head because to be fair, I am doing really well like I am consistently recognized as a good worker and I've noticed with my job, there will be periods of ""slumps"" so sometimes I wonder if it's just a bad day/week but it's never gotten better, per se. I know I can do better but I feel burnt out (I've yet to take a day off besides weekends) or just depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of work, it's a bit better. I don't do much with my days and I haven't really been taking care of my hygiene (don't get me started on my knot of a hair!), which was actually my therapist's first suggestion of depressive symptoms (about a month ago). It just feels inevitable that all of that has almost snowballed into this low-effort, almost apathetic but also guilt-tripping self. The battle between wanting to do more and looking back and realizing how lazy I feel is eating me alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, I have a coworker I love. We have grown to be really good friends and they are constantly supporting me but I can't help but feel jealous of all their success. And that jealousy makes me want to antagonize them which I know is sooo petty and wrong of me. They literally gave me recognition at our last meeting and yet here I am chastising them for exceeding so many team goals. And then it just raises that question of why not me? Why can't I get myself to do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if it's depression or laziness. How did this depression bout just suddenly come? I like the way things are going, in a way, like I like my job and the value it brings people, I am getting more time to myself and for self-care yet I feel like I can't even take advantage of any of this because of this guilt that feels reinforced by my laziness or depression or whatever it is. It's crazy because when I last met with my psychiatrist (like 2 weeks ago), I was bragging about how awesome I feel. Now, it's just slump. For context, I'm taking Sertaline (like 50 mg, which I think is low?), Buspirone, Vyvanse for my ADHD (which I increased the dosage of recently... I wonder if that brought upon all these depressive symptoms?), and birth control.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do to bring up my motivation or to stop being so freaking lazy ugh. I hate myself and every now and then, my head spins into this idea of pricking myself or hurting myself which I know I won't do bu it's like this image in my head whenever I feel really low or stressed",pop1238,4,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5zcc6/lack_of_motivation_in_the_workplace_or_laziness/

Don't have anything to look forward in my life and just waiting for the day to die,"So right now as you can see in my post history, my mother passed away. My father passed away as well. Right now the only thing that will actually make me happy is being with them but that won't happen until i'm probably dead as well. I actually have nothing to look forward to in my life and i'm just waiting for that moment to come to be reunited with them. I actually like to think this world is shit and always has been, but the afterlife is much better. I was always kind of scared of dying, but at this moment I'll be thrilled and excited when it does happen. I'm only 27, but I  don't look forward to being married and having kids. I don't really look forward to any enjoyment that would come in my life from this point until I actually do die. Sometimes I feel like I already am dead. I feel like a ghost sometimes just roaming this Earth. I feel like I would thoroughly enjoy the company of the ones who have left this world rather than the people who are in it.  


 This doesn't really include my parents but includes other people in my family that have gone as well as several thousands of famous people that have gone as well. I would love their company and just seeing them would be fantastic, but at this moment I can't really witness that and enjoy that. Most of my life I always felt empty on the inside, I felt like a a lifeless puppet that roamed the world, but what gave me life and what actually gave meaning to my life is my own parents.  


 I would not be in this world if it wasn't for them and my own world now is shattered now that they are gone. Theres no one I love more than them and I just seriously cannot wait till I do die to see them.

How much is enough when you feel surrounded by nothing?,"34/m, no kids, engaged, tradesman.  Insanely lucky and fortunate. Making more money than ever and far beyond what ""I should be"". 

Socially, I find little interest in most people. I work, by choice, 80 or so hours a week. I devote myself to what I find meaningful. I cut no corners at work and make sure everything my fiance wants, happens. 

Over the years it seems she's become accustomed to doing less to nothing. Even suggested we hire a maid. This from someone who I adored for being independent and minimal. 10 pairs of shoes, purses that had purpose and a thoughtful demeanor. Now,  multiple thousand dollar purses, literally hundreds of shoes and no will to help with anything. 

I say things are different and I'm met with anger and scrutiny.  I'm not perfect but I don't ask for much if anything. I'm not filled with cowardice. I'm just tired of building castles out of sand. Tired of being told I need to communicate better then finding only arguments when I say anything other than positive reinforcements for things I don't actually see. 

I'm just beginning to wonder if I'm crazy or just extremely unlucky to feel catfished once again. I realize transparency isn't usually a reality in the early stages of relationships but these are night and day differences and ""happy wife,  happy life"" only makes things feel more daunting. 

And yes, I understand she has insecurities and issues with depression, as well. I acknowledge her concerns and support her. But I don't feel it's reciprocated.

Avoid psych wards like the plague," 

I recently read a post on r/SuicideWatch discussing how terrible psychiatric wards are to suicidal patients and how they do more harm than good. I will be primarily piggybacking off that post but also adding my own thoughts.

I'll preface by stating that I have been in and out of psychiatric hospitals since I was 11 (I'm 23 now). Doctors who work in psychiatry operate under the assumption that the ""magic pills"" they dispense will restore a person to ""normalcy"" (whatever that means) and any resistance to accepting their treatment is just the manifestation of denial and delusion that put the person in the ward to begin with. The bottom line is that a hospital will just lie about statements you've made and do anything to fabricate a reason to keep you more or less incarcerated in the units. They make money based on how many beds they fill so why should they let you go? After a day you are more or less settled in the unit and a ""known quantity"" (meaning they know your risk level) so why should they go through the hassle of bringing in a new patient who may actually need the help? Patients who are easy to manage make them just as much money as more difficult patients, as evidenced by the fact that when difficult patients are brought in they are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, usually transferred to group homes or other long term care settings within a day or so. It's the people who are somewhere in between who get royally screwed by the hospitals, and for good reason. They want to wring as much profit as possible from you.

I am not against psychiatric care, and I certainly don't believe that a person who is actively suicidal or has attempted suicide should be left to their own devices. I have seen many people who, thanks to a simple chemical imbalance in their brains, had profound mental illness that was cleared up through a relatively simple regimen of medication and therapy. That is certainly called for (IN CERTAIN CASES), but the ""one size fits all"" approach to psychiatry does not work for all patients and in a lot of cases these medications do more harm than good. Many medications completely destroy your energy, sex drive, and cause you to turn into a shell of your former self. Your entire personality, everything that makes you you gets sucked away. It's also important to realize that we are only about 20 years in to this experiment in mass medicating the population, the SSRI's are so overprescribed that they are actually permeating the water supply in cities like Los Angeles on account of so many people flushing them. So take the advice of the doctors with a grain of salt, they represent one side of the argument and they have spent years of medical schools being brainwashed into the idea that medication is the only acceptable response to any set of issues a patient may be confronted with.

Getting to the subject of psychiatric wards themselves, I've seen downright sociopathic behavior by staff in those facilities that would make your skin crawl. Restraints performed by staff unnecessarily out of personal spite towards patients, nurses who were just downright rude and unprofessional, the wards are filthy and barely cleaned, and the doctors are condescending and see patients as widgets in a money making machine, not people who need help. The focus is on profit, then on treatment. This leads to, in my experience, patients being taken advantage of. I am not your standard ""in and out of psych wards"" patient. I have a degree in mathematics with a minor in physics, I'm highly intelligent and I have a good job. If you listened to the doctors and nurses talk to me, you would think I were a random homeless person talking to the walls and defecating in his hospital bed. Just a complete lack of respect and regard for people's dignity. If you are actively suicidal, a psychiatric ward is NOT the place for you. You should think long and hard about your options before you attempt, because if you don't succeed, and those doors close behind you, you are not a person anymore. You have no rights besides the right to do what the hospital staff tells you to do. Think about it before you give up your autonomy by giving the police power to take ""emergency custody"" of you. They will take you up on your request, and charge you $20,000 for the privilege.",Grand-Page4285,46,29,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5he2k/avoid_psych_wards_like_the_plague/

I don’t think I can forgive myself,"I’m in my late 30s. Supportive and loving husband. Wonderful kid. I make a good living and I’m lucky enough that this pandemic didn’t hit us as badly as it hit others.

But I get thoughts. Little thoughts sometimes that if I never woke up tomorrow, it would be fine. And I’m angry at myself. How could I think that when I’m blessed? How could I think that and do that to my husband and son? How can I be so selfish? I get paranoid. I can’t trust anyone and I feel I’m only valuable as a person so long as I can contribute, whether that’s at work or at home. I feel that if I fall apart, no one will be interested and care enough to help me. 

I had never sought treatment for my depression until recently. It’s not something that’s considered “real” in my culture. I’ve had two therapists and I only got to a couple of visits each because I struggle with getting over my culture where this isn’t talked about. My culture doesn’t understand that if you’re successful, healthy, and loved, there’s no reason to feel like this. My uncle committed suicide by shooting himself. My family never talks about it. And I feel like I’m wasting everyone’s time.

When we moved here to the US almost 15 years ago, life at first was hard. We didn’t have a good relationship with his family then like we do now and we’ve had to depend on the kindness of strangers to put a roof over our heads. We lived in a room with a lady we met at Target and we only had the extra mattress they lent us in the room. Back then, everyday all we heard was that we’re not good enough to survive here. That we’re nobodies here. That our third-world country education didn’t matter. As an immigrant woman and a person of color, I struggled to relate. So I taught myself to learn how people talk here, what they like to talk about, even though it’s not something I want to talk about. I’ve got to belong. Got to put that mask on and just trudge on. Got to put the past behind me and look forward.

Even now when things are so much better and my son looks at me like I’m the best person in his world, I feel I don’t deserve it. Why do I feel that way? Why do I feel like a failure? A fraud? Like I’m so selfish for feeling this way? That I’m tired and at the same time telling myself I shouldn’t complain? I’m so tired.

I'm begging you. Please help me.,"I don't write as much anymore.


It's not that it doesn't hurt anymore, or that I am no longer numb.
I guess I've just accepted that writing about it solves nothing. I could sit here for hours listing all my fears, all my hopes and all my dreams. I could explain why I have no hopes and why all my dreams are nightmares. I could write about why the only thing that I feel anymore is fear. If only I knew why.


Over time, I've accepted that nobody will help me. It's not that they can't. They just don't want to try. I've learned to function while my brain screams in terror about things nobody will ever know the answer to. To smile while all I can do is question why we all exist and how. How did something come from nothing? Where did the nothing exist before there was something? How? Why?


What will happen when we die?


I've tried to talk about it, but nobody understands. You're to young to be worrying about that they say. You're only 14. I don't understand why they are like that. It only takes one second and everything that you ever loved, everything that ever was, could be gone in an instant. That's the reason why I tell my family members almost obsessively, that I love them. Even if I'm not particularly fond of them. When the end comes I want them to know that they were loved. Even if I don't feel loved myself.

All my family talks about is depressing stuff.,"It's to the point where I can't stand being in the house anymore. I can't handle being the dumpster pile that more garbage gets thrown on top of. Every single evening without fail now, I'm leaving the house just to get away from them. I just go for drives, walk around random stores, say we're out of milk, go buy a soda, I do anything to avoid being home. It's so exhausting. The only time I'm happy is when I'm alone. When I'm alone cooking, sleeping, showering, watching tv. I'm never really happy. 

I went to Lowe's tonight. I just wanted to walk around. I talked to the sales clerk. Than my mom called me. Warned me about how someone may try to kidnap me in the parking lot. We came home and before I even went to pee she wanted to have a nice talk about credit card debt and her medical bills.

Idk how to help,"I’m in an on and off again relationship with someone with severe depression. It’s been 5 years now and the entire time I’ve known him he’s gone up and down, but each down gets worse and worse. 

He’s always had suicidal ideations for as long as I’ve known him but last month he actually did try to kill himself. He had just switched medications so that may have been a trigger. He has a very stressful and demanding job do he gets home exhausted and then has terrible insomnia from his depression and anxiety. Basically it’s a bad cycle he can’t get off (no, he won’t take time off) and I see it wearing him down. He’s off meds because they didn’t work for him and waiting to see a new psychiatrist in the next few weeks. 

Idk what to do to support him. I tell him that I want to be there for him and support him but I worry my presence does more harm than good. It’s probably my own insecurities but I don’t want him to feel guilty about not texting me back or seeing me because he’s so depleted and I do wonder if I should just let him end things with me; he tries at least once a week. I usually stop texting him when he says that I should just move on with my life because I know he’s going to change his mind and apologize for it the next day. 

But it’s getting hard for me to know what else I can do to help him. Idk what more to do or how to help, I just want him to know that I love him and I won’t abandon him but what if I’m making things worse by making him feel like he’s a burden to me ( ive told him he isn’t multiple times). I feel like an asshole for even worrying about how this when he struggles so much everyday. 

I’ll take absolutely any advice or insight anyone has to offer because I’m at a loss right now. I tried talking to a therapist about it but that was a total waste of time. Is there anything I can do or say to him that would help or even make a difference a little bit, even just a small amount?",TopFormer,3,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5zaqs/idk_how_to_help/
"My [21M] gf [21F] is depressed and I have no idea, how to help her.","Hey y'all

I don't know if this is an appropriate subreddit to ask this but I need help.

Me and my gf are in LDR since past three years and we hail from a country where people don't give a shit about mental health.

I was getting a vibe that she isn't doing well since past two weeks. When I enquired, she brushed off the topic saying that its just work stress and all.
But I know her, she isn't like this. So I seriously asked her what's going on and why is she not feeling well. She cried and told me that she is fed up of her life and there is so much pain that she can't feel peace. Something gloomy keeps poking her thoughts at all times.

She has started comparing her life and work to all those around her and that makes her feel like shit. I try my level best to boast her up and encourage her but all in vain. I tried telling her that self love is most important but I guess that's not how to talk to a person who's already depressed. 

I have started to feel afraid to say something to her as she gets mad over small things. It's affecting our relationship and me  too and I don't wanna lose her. I love her so fucking much. 

I wanna know as what should I do to make her pain less? How can I handle this situation? Any advice will be appreciated.

Surgery,"Supposed to be getting surgery next Tuesday. It’s nothing serious. It’s just a simple procedure to determine if endometriosis is causing my chronic pain issues and if it is then removing as much of it as possible. I’m super nervous about it though, but my dad kind of put me into a depressed mood too with the way he’s acting about it. He goes to his girlfriend’s place every night starting around 4pm and not coming home until almost midnight. When he’s not over there he’s working. He’s basically gone the entire day except for like 4 hours (not including sleeping). I asked him if he could stay home the week I’m recovering. I don’t want to be home alone all day while I’m in potential pain or struggling to move or something. He proceeds to go on this ramble about how “I could be walking around the same day after surgery” and how “both my sister and I know that he’s always gone to his girlfriend’s house every night”. Essentially saying he wouldn’t be willing to put his nightly visits on temporarily pause to be there for me if I needed him to. I’m not sure why but this upsets me. Site it’s a common procedure, but it’s still surgery nonetheless and you’d think that would matter more to him then watching tv at his girlfriend’s house all night.

I've always wanted to just no longer exist but am too much of a pussy to do something about it although if I did I would probably just jump so there's no turning back.

My bf is supportive and is trying to get me to go to therapy but I just haven't because of the hopelessness of it all, and lately i feel like he spends more timing telling me what I need to do rather than actually being there for me in the moment, tho probably because I'm actively ruining his life and he's most likely starting to resent me for it. I'm in school but have wasted the entire experience as I've just bsed my way through the whole thing and don't feel like I'm actually knowledgeable at anything and it's a great source of shame as I have feel like I'm just using my family who has helped put me through it for nothing.

Fear of failure,Yesterday I had my driving test and I failed (because I couldn’t do parallel parking) and I admit I was nervous and I went knowing I was going to fail but the reality of failure is so hard and depressing. After the test on the outside I was pretty calm and I went home not wanting to think about it at all and the first thing everyone asked was if I passed and I told them no. What got me upset is before my test my mom was said it was okay if I failed cause everyone failed the first time and it was like she was expecting to fail. A few words of encouragement or a little bit of hope in me thinking that I would’ve passed would’ve made me feel better instead I feel really crappy. The feeling of someone expecting you the fail is hurtful at least to me it is but that could be me overreacting. I was fine yesterday cause I kept myself busy and I went to sleep early so I wouldn’t have to think about it but today after school it hit me all at once. And now every time I think about I feel like crying or biting myself. I have to pass before my 18th birthday which is in 4 weeks and I know I can probably take the test two more times but the thought of not passing those times is haunting especially since everyone expects me to pass the second time.,MostCover4464,5,14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5v6hr/fear_of_failure/

Then COVID hit and my buddy (27m) lost his place to stay so I offered to let him stay at my place at first it wasn't too big of a deal but then I would come home from work the food would be gone, my weed was all smoked, and nothing would be cleaned. I fell into a deep depression trying to make enough to support both him and myself. They stopped evictions so I started spending money on things more vital to survival (e.g. food, electricity) and also turned to drugs and alcohol to soothe the pain I was feeling inside. I was broke all the time but at least I had some ketamine and snacks right? Even today I still feel resentment towards him for not getting a job or helping with anything hell even a simple ""hey man you're not okay we need to fix this"" would have been nice. Anyway, after about 6 months I was finally evicted and luckily was able to move back in with my dad in a room that can hold my clothes, a bed, and that's it (not really complaining about this but moving from a full apartment to a room that's significantly smaller definitely wasn't easy) I lost a lot of things in the move anything I couldn't fit in my car or in the room I had to get rid of so my car basically turned into my space. Living with my dad I was able to get back on antidepressants and although I'm not completely sober I am definitely better with using substances. At the beginning of March a friend and I went to a club we used to go to all the time and a bartender we've seen many times before offered us a shot so we said sure because why not trust the bartender that's served you numerous drinks before? Well turns out he decided to drop some GHB into our drinks and we blacked out only to wake up on the side of I-4 after I totalled my car. Luckily we were both alright physically but mentally I'm still fucked up everything I had was in that car and I'll never get any of it back. I couldn't get out of bed for several days afterwards and all my parents could remind me of is ""you could have killed your friend and she could've sued you"" like I wasn't already aware of that. It is now 2 months later and I still break down thinking about that night I can't even drink a jack &amp; coke without getting mad anxiety. I haven't been able to fully recover from either situation and all I want is a fresh start or some guidance or something.

Failing college classes? What next?,"As the title says, I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all of my classes this semester. 

Some background info on me is that I am considered a senior and up until a year ago I was usually an a/b student. I have never been diagnosed with depression, but have gone to doctors in the past for depression like symptoms (fatigue, excessive sleeping, loss of interest, trouble concentrating, etc.) . Tests were done to rule out other causes, and questionnaires were used for anxiety and depression. When the questionnaires were given to me, I purposely didn't answer truthfully as I was afraid that a diagnosis would negatively impact my future. I also have been struggling with this on and off since middle school, but had been able to hide/mask when the symptoms became bad. 

A couple of years has passed since seeing the doctor, and I have been progressively getting worse. I just feel lost, like I'm drowning, and don't really care if my future is negatively impacted anymore; I want to be able to be happy or feel anything. Last year I had started visualizing  myself cutting/ slicing my forearms  or I had felt almost a pain to tear my forearm open. **I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING TO PHYSICALLY HARM MYSELF ON PURPOSE.**  I just keep seeing/ replaying it in my head, but I know that giving into it will not help and make things worse for me. Also, the tiredness became too much for me that I couldn't even muster to open up online classes or even basically take care of myself. 

What I need to know now is how do I get help, is there any way for me to fix my semster/gpa, and should I take a semster off to get help? 

Any advice would help honestly.

I wish to not care about such dumb things, I want to just be grateful and be happy with the people I have. Thats all I want. There might be people out there who may feel the same as me, and I hope they receive the luck to one day obtain friends. I hope that everyone could try to get a connection and not be friends with people for simple fun, but to be able to connect with them as if your one, to be able to understand each others pain, understand each others emotions.

Psych Med Conundrum,"I've always been reluctant to put psychotropic meds into my body and have opted to use natural boosts like exercise, meditation, healthy eating, connecting with ppl and whatever else brings me joy and nourishes my body and soul. I haven't always been consistent with those tools so it's hard to say how effective they have been (I definitely notice a mood increase after socializing with genuine friends and a calmness after exercising or meditation). Anyway, I hit a very rough mental health patch 2 years ago, feels like depression on and off with some anxiety, intrusive thoughts and mood swings (they haven't actually diagnosed me with anything specific because I'm highly functioning I guess or just don't quite fit anywhere). I was suggested meds and decided to give them a shot. I have tried a few. Prozac 10 mg, made me numb, so I stopped it after 2 months. Abilify 2 mg, seems to have quieted the intrusive thoughts and according to my BF my mood swing intensity decreased. I didn't feel too different however. I stopped it after a month due to my overall med aversion. I started Zoloft 25 mg a month ago and it caused me to have night sweats, headaches, stomach issues and suicidal ideation (I've never experienced it before), the whole time! I'm tapering off of it now! I read that these are signs of excess serotonin (which must mean I have normal amounts of it naturally).

I just started Gym again and am hiking more hoping that this will help me and I won't need to try another med. I'm in grad school, am working part time and am functioning pretty well. There's just a fear of having those super bad days where I cry in bed all day or can't sleep due to racing thoughts. I really don't think my chemistry is out of whack and I want to try being healthy more consistently to hopefully not need medical assistance. I also hope to do more meaningful things with my days, maybe volunteer at a wildlife center and create art, to feed my soul. That's what I believe the real issue is. Many of us struggled with lack of fulfillment and authentic living, causing our essence to revolt in depression and anxiety! Unless there truly is a chemical imbalance! That's a different story, I just feel that it's not mine. There's no way for doctors to know what goes on in our brain (neuronally) so that throws me off and makes me not want to keep trying various pills. Plus if the brain is actually functioning normally, I read that SSRIs can fuck with it in some irreversible way. 

Guess my question is, what has your experience been with meds and other methods of healing? Have you found what works for you without a concrete diagnosis? Has a healthy lifestyle and self care taken care of the intense blues? Have you found a way to live more authentically and the anxiety dissipated? I know that life ebbs and flows and that we all experience stressful times... I'm just seeking relief from the pretty consistent (2 years) feelings of unhappiness. Yes I'm in therapy, just found a different therapist who can see me more consistently and hopefully will be a good fit. That's another reason I'm stopping meds. I want to see if consistent, good therapy can clarify and alleviate my struggles.

I can’t find meaning anymore,"I’m so tired of living, nothing makes any sense. Why am I here?

Living because dying isn’t an option,"xpost r/suicidewatch

For over ten years, I have struggled with on/off suicidal thoughts. I have never thought myself at risk of suicide, as I try to reduce harm to those around or near to me. I know my own death would be so devastating to some that I won’t do it, however I often wish for a deadly car accident or some other freak accident. I have even been open with friends on the fact that my cat (not an emotional support animal, but a dear friend) is my tether to the real world.

I know that many other people can share in my thought that being alive is a chore, but also dying would be a worse chore. 

I almost don’t want to post this because being honest with my emotions is difficult, but I also want to know I’m not alone and that there is a way to continue without self harm and emotional success.",thrown-away-867-5309,4,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5x7ql/living_because_dying_isnt_an_option/

Sorry about any grammar issues I made this at 10pm

I know most likely nobody will see this but I might as well make this: I have anxiety and depression. I tried to open up to people but they told me to just man up. I've had suicidal thoughts for a while now so I can stop all of this pain because if nobody cares then what's the point of it all? but I've decided not to because it'll just hurt the people who I do care about. Some of my first friends that I ever had bullied me and made me feel like I was the scum of the earth and told me to kill myself and I tried to but I failed. I would go into the details of it but I'd rather not. People tell me to stop hiding my emotions and that it's okay to be emotional and then tell me to shut up and ignore me. I stay in bed for hours and just don't want to get out I'm not motivated to do anything anymore and everybody is just calling me lazy now.

I've felt more or less empty for the last six months,"It's waxed and waned over the last few months but overall I've felt empty and I've gone through periods of numbness where I barely feel emotions and don't react to things the way I should. The numbness just appears out of the blue and goes away just as fast. I always thought those emo songs about wanting to feel something were being dramatic but I get it now. The last few times the numbness has hit, I've done some things I regret to see if I could get myself back but it never worked.

I've been thinking a lot about God lately..,"Let me just preface with saying that I'm not at all religious nor am I interested in pushing a religious narrative to you guys/gals/gulls

My official stance is there isn't sufficient evidence either side for whether or not there is a God and if there was, any religions depiction of how they see God doesn't appeal to me...but that's not the point of this post...this might be a long one but please bear with me 

I love philosophy, I also love ethics, logic, psychology, history...I guess I love learning. However, philosophy is my top love. 

I was raised in a family of philosophers, I'd be given crazy ethical scenarios from a very young age and it's left me deeply caring about, well what it's all about really.

I really struggle with retaining stuff and understanding difficult concepts so it's a huge challenge but I'm starting with the high level stuff so maybe this will end up the ramblings close to a stoner that's lost count on her 5th puff.

I've been relearning about ontological arguments (arguments/reasons for God's existence). It's incredibly interesting, I appreciate listening and being able to challenge them. 

I noticed a common theme of people using logic and reasoning to prove God's existence however for the God they're trying to prove exists; he would have to exist beyond reason.

For example, God must be able to do literally anything and everything. So could he make a rock that he himself couldn't move? 

God must know everything that has happened, will happen and is happening...but we have to have free will too...while he knows exactly what we're going to do and it's all basically laid out on the strings of fate.

The crazy thing I realised though, people aren't stupid...within reason..believing in God isn't about accepting the facts and the logic that he MUST or MUST NOT exist. 

No, it's all about faith.

Having the faith that there is this all powerful being, beyond reason and logic that's there and exists. The understanding that no matter how many challenges or problems or anything really you go through, God has your back.

I realised that everyone needs that something that ""has their back"". Gamblers rely on that big win, people rely on their family, there's people who rely on their soul mate or job or even knowing taking this drug will let their worries go away for a bit and it's not that different.

Even though logically, the odds are against them, the gambler still has faith in those tiny odds or they get their partner is human and can fuck up and be selfish at any given moment but they have faith in that person. 

I started thinking about Descartes, ya know, ""doubt everything"" and ""I can think I'm doubting my existence therefore I exist"". Good ol' Rene...The only thing I can 100% know is real is this bit in my mind that's doubting everything in the first place 

So all I know is myself...

Then I found it really really weird how my anxiety completely operates on empirical knowledge and logic. ""This has happened before, therefore it can happen again""/""they're laughing, they're laughing at me""/""I've been called weird therefore I'm weird"" 

Not really realising that me, my life, being here right now able to type this out defies so much. There's not logic to why I'm here, there's no real evidence to who I am. My existence and who I am like deep down defies reason and I've been trying to learn and improve using tools like logic and reason. 

I wondered what it would mean if I just accept I'm not logical or reasonable. I want to be kind but I'll do selfish things sometimes, I promote something and do the exact opposite minutes later, I'll feel smart and pretty one minute and hate myself the next.

I make no sense, Other people don't make much sense either...everything around me to a degree doesn't make much sense either. Sure we have some idea and getting a better idea everyday and we've ticked some pretty big boxes on how stuff happens but there's so much that we don't know 

I wondered...what if I accepted that a lot of me is beyond reason that I'll do things that are illogical, I will see things in an unreasonable way and have crazy logic stuff going on and it will drive me insane if I try to figure out why I do it 

And what if I just started having a little faith in myself. Faith that I'm doing okay, faith that I'll get to where I wanna go, faith that I know what the right thing to do is, faith that I'll do every task to the best of my ability at the time, that I'll treat everyone that best that I can and if I'm challenged by anything in life I'll have enough faith in myself that I'll get through it. 

It's crazy, it makes no sense...but me being here is crazy, I make no...or at least little sense...I defy all the odds to ever exist by being here.

Maybe I just need a little faith in myself.

The expectaions are too high...,Having high expectations for someone is like telling them if they dont do good they are worse than everyone else. But when they do good they feel like a genius and thus never study or try anymore leading them down the rabbit hole of misery. Being praised and celebrating achievements is cool and all but that could really hurt your work ethic. I had the mindset of that i was so good and didnt need to try now im just not doing well at all. Not doing a single assignment over shutdown periods and have a nearly non existent work ethic doesn't help either. Adults need to understand we have limits snd not bottomless potential. Our energy isnt infinite. Our mental health is more important than school. But you telling us to not do anything but study makes me depressed. Not able to do anything. Barely able to function. As a teenager this will effect my future and its not all their fault. Maybe i shouldnt have been so arogent right? But i was a kid i didnt knoe better. This id why many melenials and gen z have seperated themselves form their parents to not become like them. To learn fron their parents mistakes. To become who they want to be. But you cant get the point acrosd to adults because were just kids. We have no authority. We cant talk back or we will be punished. I cant say anything i want but apparently free speach is a thing.

I am not okay," 

I fucking moved schools in yr 11, and I really thought I'd be fine. It's one of them schools for smart ppl which I already hate, but the point is that's the only reason I moved, because my old school was dangerous and has a poor education.

I don't have any friends, and it's so lonely. Ofc there's people I talk with and sit with during lunch, but it's mostly everyone talking to each other and me sitting there. It's lonelier than being alone.

I've tried to make friends on multiple occasions. It just never works out, either there's no connection and we're just really different people, or I feel left out OR they turn out to be either a homophobe, racist or a combination. Sometimes there are people I talk to who I think could be friends, and it's just so fucking dumb, how hard it is to ask, and just start. And there's always this thing I feel like no one likes me. Because I really do think that.

There's this big ass joke about me, that I'm from the hood, just cause I'm from a shitty ass poor fucking suburb. I kind of just laugh along but it's getting on my nerves fr.

Also there's such a long travel that burns me out every day, and I've never felt more sick and unhealthy in my life. I feel like at any given point I'll collapse, and I keep getting actually sick, to the point where I can't learn or study.

There's no connections with my teachers either, I just don't know how to connect with anyone.

I'm exhausted and I don't want to do this anymore. I'm failing one of my subjects, not doing too well in the others, and overall feel like I have no hope. I want to move back to my old school, but it's halfway through the year and I'm just trying to stick it out. i don't want to say how I'm feeling because my parents are already pretty busy with their own shit and i just don't know what to say.

everydays a hassle, and everyday I don't want to wake up, don't want to do anything.

Everyday when i wait for my train i think about how easy it is to just jump out in front of it.

Honestly even before this school, I don't think i was okay. I was cutting myself (and I stopped), and overall miserable. Sometimes i don't even know why, I just feel hollow. But at least then I had friends, and I don't think i realised just how important they were",CCDSNHUFGDHNS,1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n625to/i_am_not_okay/
wasting my life,"fifteen (sixteen in a month), male

tl;dr - i loathe myself immensely, i have no aspirations, i smoke weed everyday and i have no idea what i’m doing with my life. someone give me advice please.

i’m almost sixteen and all i do is smoke weed, wait for school to end just so i can: go home and lay down in bed for hours, watch porn and play video games until morning all so i can repeat this wretched cycle over and over again.

where did it all go wrong, i’m only fifteen? i’m still trying to answer that question. but i believe it the first lockdown last year. i would do everything i mentioned in the previous paragraph except from smoking weed and going to school. i stayed up until 07:00 every morning and woke up at 13:00, in turn affecting my health - physically and mentally. i was always tired, and it made my skin very pale. although it didn’t give me spots, it opened up my pores and i quite literally looked like a zombie. i kept up that routine for about six months and never aimed to change it in spite of the fact i felt like shit every single day. i didn’t feel the need to, video games and porn was there to make me feel better. i was looking forward to going back to school but when i returned i quickly remembered how shit school is, especially with covid-19 regulations on top of my social anxiety that i obtained over the first few weeks. i got it due to my appearance, how ugly i became from that lockdown routine and other insecurities that i won’t even mention here because i’m that insecure. so i found out about weed, found a guy, got some paraphernalia and started smoking weed. it was a way to bare the burden of going to school everyday. i hated school. no, no, i simply didn’t care. i didn’t give a single fuck about school and just wanted to go back into another lockdown so i could waste away my life further. so i followed that routine up until december, which was when i thought “what are you doing? you’ve been like this for too long now just get your shit together this isn’t you. you used to be a good kid; got good grades, got girls, got good friends, was very fit and attractive, always helped your parents and had motivation and ambition.” so i started to workout, revise and try get my sleeping together. i was making progress very slowly but it was better than nothing. when 2021 came around i thought it would be my time to really get it together and “no more fucking around anymore” but we went into another lockdown until march. obviously that reversed all my progress and led me back into my previous lockdown routine for another three months and saying “i’ll get my shit together soon it’s fine” for the whole of lockdown. when i went back to school the same thing that happened before happened again. after a few weeks of school i decided to sell my pc in hopes of bettering myself. in april i decided “okay, you’ve been in this rut for a year now, now it’s time to actually get it together for summer.” so i did. for the whole of april i: got my sleeping together (slept at 21:00, woke up 06:00), found a source of income (made a few bills), started working out again, eating healthy, going outside, talking to people, taking cold showers every single morning (although i was already doing this two years prior to all of this), nofap and overall just trying to focus on bettering my mental health. however, no matter how much i slept, that bright skin tone i used to have never came back, my skin is still terrible to this day despite my efforts to revert back to what i used to be. no to mention my other insecurities as well as the ones that i have no control over.

but no matter how hard i fucking try i always go back into those wretched habits that got me into this rut in the first place. i think it’s been incredibly bad for my mental health. i’m quite certain there is something wrong with me at this point. maybe depression, personality disorder, bipolar, extreme anxiety? and no i’m not being a self-diagnosing, attention seeking little fuck. i’m out here because i believe i’m actually in need of help and despite the impression i may have outputted through my writing i’m not one to seek for attention and it makes me fucking wonder how did i, out of all people, end up like this? everything i swore not to be as a child. i fucking hate it. i hate myself. not long back i planned my suicide. as soon as i leave the house i’m finding a way to end it all; whether that be with a gun, jumping off a building or any other painless methods. teachers ask me what do i want to be when i’m older like i always think “i don’t know i plan to end it all as soon as i get the chance”. and every time i think of negative thoughts like this (all the time) i think “where did it all go wrong? i was such a good boy with so much potential and was so kind.” never in a million years would i expect myself to become this abomination i’ve become i can’t even express my feeling properly because i’ve become that fucking stupid. i can’t take this fucking shit anymore fuck me my parents are always so good to me always giving they’re all for me just so i can smoke weed and jerk off fuck my life what happened to me ;(

like i said i know what you may be thinking about the kind of person i am but i’m not good at expressing my feelings especially not in the state i’m in now. and i think there’s actually something wrong with me. and i’ve never talked about this to anyone i’ve been bottling all of my emotions for the past year and on nights like these it just pains me thinking about my life and i always cry in silence so i don’t wake anyone up and that pains me so much i just want to let it all out and typing on reddit is probably my coping mechanism oh my fucking god i’m so fucking retarded what’s wrong with me what am i doing here.

hm i just remembered - i’m a guy. oh yeah as ever minute goes by people’s care for me decreases and when i become a man no one in the world will care because we’re men we don’t have feelings do we? which is fine i completely understand and i’m not against it it’s just the way life is. but i’m just in so much pain it hurts and i’ve only been here for 15 years ;( oh my fucking god i have much more to endure. and i hate to sound like that little bitch but i’m really bad right now i’m in need of help this is completely out of character for who i am and it’s been like this for so long i don’t know who i am anymore i’ve lost all hope for me i’m simply just living right now waiting for jack shit as each day goes by, wasted. fuck my life i’m sorry if i ruined anyone’s day fuck me why am i still typing but i’m still going to post this to see if anyone replies although it’s fine if they don’t i don’t expect anyone to care i’m just another person with issues i’ll get over them yeah yeah i’m not even going to check over what i’ve written fuck my life oh my god OMFG fuckkkk i just can’t anymore. i wish i could just wake up in the perfect life, perfect healthy body although i guess i already did, 15 years ago, but i’ve fucked it all up already. help. please.",nckxpaquir,5,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5tbuo/wasting_my_life/

Any motivation or praise just feels like it's meant for somebody else, and I can never accept anything positive, legitimately. I gave up on school after barely two months into the semester and have now had some dicked dead end job at a messy bakery just downtown for about a calendar month now, just as something to do while I try to let life figure itself out for me while I'm petrified to do anything for any sense of reasonable change all the while. At least I have it good working in some place that isn't hostile but it reminds me of how I don't like existing, lol. At least my first hunting for a job wasn't a failure but it's no where near a success. No muscle definition (or worse, the opposite) and stamping bags / boxes with the company logo for nearly my whole shift, while pleasant and not an absolute disgusting mess I'd be given to do any other day, did leave me with my core sore as hell and wanting to quit. How pathetic from some kid, I hope the manager thinks to their self. They got the whole ""so nice it's annoying / oppressive"" environment going on. My first couple weeks, I got straddled with a cold / sore throat that wouldn't solve itself so I had to get professional help and a medication. My family won't hear any of this so I needed to release a little of the pressure on my mind.

It's all just a dead end. The weight of needing to fulfill my mom's wishes to be self-sufficient for my own self, the weight of ""you need to figure your life out,"" it all just sits on my shoulders like those pain in the ass vests you have to wear to get an x-ray, like if at the dentist, y'know? Or maybe that's the stamping soreness talking, hah.

The song I mentioned at the start of this post? I always thought the lyrics were ""Everybody's gonna lose, everybody's gonna die..."" It makes more sense to me that way. It's very difficult in an OCD way to accept my way of thinking things vs what might be perceived as common knowledge, moreso that there's a difference or what have you. My sense as an individual has almost always been obliterated. So my one step for tonight is to accept that I think the lyrics of that song are what I think - everybody *will* lose, and everybody *will* die. It's painful but, if everything is painful then is anything really painful? I'm pretty sure it's still painful but I hope this'll help me cope before I find the next motivation to post my inane ramble to a pit of nothingness.

I'm a horrible person.,"I am trying so hard at so many things, and there are so many things I should be proud of and excited about. I'm a freshman in college and got mostly A's this semester, I also got my first co-op in software development. I've started using online dating apps for the first time and am actually talking to girls. I run or workout almost every day. But by days end, when I'm lying in bed, I often find myself with tears welling up in my eyes and the deepest, most empty, darkest, painful pit churning in my stomach. No not my stomach, my soul. It's completely empty, a void. Sometimes I wish I won't wake up. I hate myself. I have no friends. I'm not good enough at my job. I'm ugly. I'm always tired. I'm awkward. I'm shy. I'm not funny. I'm stupid. I'm a fake. I'm filled with anxiety. I'm wasting my life away. Nobody likes me and I can't connect to anyone. But the thing that weighs on me the most is that I'll never find love and I'll always be alone. What is wrong with me? I shouldn't even be allowed to be sad, there's no reason for me to be sad. I hate my self even more because there are so many other people that need help more than me. But here I am talking about myself.

I think I'm the problem,"I am so fucking lonely. I try so, so hard to reach out and connect with people but I rarely if ever get a response. New friends, old friends, doesn't matter.

I'm so far down the hole right now that I can only see my negative qualities that I have, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not a good person to be around. Lord knows my wife has plenty of criticism about what it's like to be around me. She tells me that I've basically been a monster since the pandemic started last year.

As an extrovert, I don't know how to be my best self without connecting with other people...but I don't know how to get people to want to be around me. I feel hopeless and stuck.

Confused,I never cry I never sit here and get sad but if you look at my life from someone else’s point of view it looks like it sucks. On rare occasions I actually sit and think about it which leads to tears but very little and they’re usually forced because I feel like I should be crying. Is this my brain compressing the pain?

Huge life changes has made Me extremely depressed,"I’m pretty sure I’ve suffered from depression my entire life but these past few months my depression has gotten almost unbearable. I don’t eat much anymore and I have lost 12 pounds in the past two months. I don’t sleep much anymore I actually can’t remember the last time I got a good nights sleep. I can’t focus on much of anything and I’m constantly under so much stress. About 2 1/2 months ago I got divorced and it left me with a lot of debt. Once I got divorced I had a plan of what I was going to do and where I was going to go in my financial situation and all that. I’m now less than a month away from move out date and about two weeks ago everything I planned for started falling apart due to an unforeseen major issue, Which I’m desperately trying to fix as quickly as I can. Now I’m struggling with two choices one would be leave my life completely behind and go back home which is about an hour and a half away from where I live now get a new job and start over down there and leave someone I love very much behind or stay here and make everything work but it be very hard (option two can’t happen unless I fix my major issue) But I’m also on a time crunch and the time I have is almost up. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this I am completely alone And everything is way too much right now. I’m just feeling so tired and drained every day is a struggle to get out of bed continue going on but I’m really determined to live on my own and do everything on my own because I know I can do it. Just right now everything feels so impossible and like every single thing is against me and I’m losing hope but at the same time I don’t want to give up, that probably doesn’t make any sense but that’s how I feel. I don’t know if anyone will actually read this but it feels good to have it written down. Sorry for my format and grammar I’m on my phone and don’t have too much time.

6 years of this shit here's some of what I have to say,"Trigger warning: mental health 

Hey guys, seeing as it's mental health month I thought Id share some of my personal experiences to support people going through similar experiances.  This post is those that are struggling and those who want to understand and help. Be warned its kinda heavy. 

 Many don't know that I've struggled with severe depression and other forms of mental illness for the past 6 years. I have finally developed some coping mechanisms to be able say I've come through the other side flourishing. I've been through the mental health system and have plenty to share to anyone who needs to hear but I'll try keep this brief seeing as it's just a Facebook status.

Having depression and the other mental health issues at the same time was the toughest experience I've ever had to endure and its something I would never wish on my worst enemy. It hurts me everytime I think that I know so many people are dealing with this, often at times mentally alone. I am lucky enough to have finally come out to the other side and some people don't so here's some things I learned based on my experiences that might help.

1. For those of you suffering from depression no matter what form I know that it is the toughest fight you'll ever have to fight. you feel alone and are constantly battling in silence while everyone else seems to have it all figured out. You feel like you shouldn't exist and at times all hope feels lost like there is literally no reasons to fight left.  only now that ive finally gotten out of it I have to let you know that there is something worth living for. the depression Will end. the type of clarity mind body and soul now that I defeat depression I can say it is worth waiting for, enduring for. I would relive all those fucked up years again if it meant I could be free from it like I am today. This will happen to you

2. The people around you would rather want you at your absolute worst no matter for how long, they would rather deal with the shit you give them from your depression or mental health issue for the rest of their lives than to lose you completely so don't ever think your doing them a favour by leaving. you are not no matter what your mind says. 

3. You are not your depression. It's external. Don't blame yourself for the actions you make while depressed or mentally unwell because that's not a part of you. it's not your personality. it's something else.bsomething you can't control. The people who really know you will see that. Don't spend your time blaming yourself for your actions. You don't deserve that. You'll get better it's just going to take time. You're dealing with something externally trying to fuck up your whole life and just by living you are doing your best to fight it. You are an absolute legend. What your doing is enough. 

4.When those thoughts come back telling you how your worthless, no one likes you, you're not worth anyone's time, the worlds better off without you ect.. Try to fight back each time that thought comes up do your best to counter it. For example the biggest one for me was you should end this what saved me was the counter thought no. one day this will end and life will be normal again. It doesn't have to be that major but for any negative thought counter it with a positive one. The small fights won matter. 

5.Get talking. find someone you can truly trust and just open up about everything let it flow you've been keeping this on the inside too long it will help don't be afraid to be vulnerable. 

6.For those on the outside looking in and know someone is struggling badger them honestly always invite them out get them out of the house never stop annoying them with your presence. show them theyre the same person they always were in your eyes and just never leave their side this is who my sister was for me and it helped me beyond words I am forever grateful. 

7.for those experiencing some sort of disorder and are struggling listen to your friends and family when your not in your right mind let them guide you don't resist in that moment they know what's best for you so don't resist them. 

8. To family's that have someone dealing with mental illness or depression and are looking to get involved in the mental health system be very wary. With inparticular admitting your loved one to one of NZs mental hospitals, they are not what they seem but in some cases are necessary. The hospitals havnt been updated since the 90s and you are sending your love one to a place with a bunch of strangers alone. A place where instead of therapy and love they get pills and scrutiny. I know In some cases there is no option but out of my six years my time in those hospitals were the worst hands down of my life. I've never felt so disrespected, unloved, abandoned, judged, and misheard and misunderstood. I'm not the only one with this experience. Also once your in the system it's damn near impossible get out. Try therapy first. If anyone wants to know more about this just speak to me. 

9. Lastly I just want to say to the rest of you who haven't dealt with it personally depression can be invisible. When I was at my absolute worst there was not a thing you could do or say to get me to show you I was depressed or suffering so be kind, you never know who's struggling or how much your kindness could mean to someone. When some one does open up listen. You don't need to offer life changing advice. Listening is enough.  Remember mental illness is something to be understood not judged. 

There is a lot of hope for the mentally ill in my experience people are so supportive now and just want to help they just need to understand a little more and that's what I hope to achieve with this message. If anyone wants to chat about anything or is struggling I'm here please message me. I care and I've been through it.

Is suicide so bad?,"Pleasw, avoid the hate and lets talk like civilized people.
Recenntly I have been thinking on suicide and the possible consequences. Well, I am starting to think that suicide is not that bad.
First. When you commit it is because you want to scape from life. So it is your life and you can do whatever you want with it. 
Second. People who ""loves"" you, dont want you to die because they will suffer, they are not usually thinking on you and your issues, they are only thinking on their suffering, not yours.
Third. Following the past point. Well, if people really love you, they would never had let you fall so deep that you are considering suicide. If they really loved you, they would have kept you save.
Fourth. Also, following the past point. They will overcome your death eventually. I mean, my parents overcame their parents death. One aunt overcame the death of two of her sons. So, there is no death that you cant ""overcome"". You should be damaged before to cant do it.
Fifth. If there is nothing after death, and you literally disappear after dying. There is nothing to regret. If ""rebirth"" exist, I think you forget everything, so, nothing to regret. If there is something after death, well, it is problem for your future, if you regret your suicide.
I know I am probably wrong, but, I dont know, man. I cant see a good future. Because, lets pretend that I became a succesful person in society, and I have a good life. But, suddenly, the world will start to going to hell. The water is starting to be scarce, the polution is still increasing. And the governments arent doing anything to save the planet. We know it. It is stupid to think that environmental problems are getting better.
Also, what is the point of living. Imagine that you conquer the world or whatever. And then? Whats next? You only die as the other people, and thats all. What is the problem to die before you are meant to do it? The world will not stop for us. The galaxy wont stop for a planet. The universe wont stop for a galaxy.

Found out yesterday my cat might have cancer and it feels impossible to find information on the procedure the vet is recommending. It's incredibly expensive and could be ineffective, leading to more procedures.

Been asking around for information and other people's experiences about it and some random asshole down-voted the post... which normally wouldn't effect me for one rando-dick to do that, but I am in such a shitty vulnerable spot right now. Who does that? What kind of sick asshole is like ""I don't want your post to get seen"" in a subreddit specifically for advice?? Wtf is wrong with some people?

I was crying all last night about it, today I am just trying to make calls to get a secondary opinion on how to handle it.

Why am I my own worst enemy,Honestly I'm not even sure why I do this to myself. As soon as I make a friend I almost immediately push them away and ruin it. I immediately  over think and my mind goes back to the bad relationships I've had before. I can't even give myself a chance. The most messed up thing is everything is going okay. I wouldn't hate myself so much if things were falling apart but I can't even let the good times stay good. I need to get out of my own head.

Running out of energy and being an unmotivated student,"Hey, im I'm junior in high school and I go to the top school in my state. As a result I have extremely high expectations of myself and take hard courses just because I need to compete in order to get into high level universities.

I just sit there in guilt that keeps piling and piling as missing assignment notifications bombard my phone. Sit there as my peers get awards, leadership opportunities, and scholarships. Sit there evaluating my choices in the past and every single failure, afraid to do something about it because I will just fail again or what even is the point this far into my high school career. 
I don't know how to get back up and I have limited time. I need to score well on the ACT i need to at least maintain my GPA so that I can get into a good university. But I'm unmotivated and every second I spend feels like a second wasted studying but I can't help it and I'm barely moving through.

Body image issues have got me feeling down.,"I have no idea why, but since i was little, i've always been the runt. In school, i was always the shortest kid in my class. Seemingly every grade. It didn't bother me because i assumed i'd be tall one day too. My dad is tall, my grandfather and uncles were tall. Like well over 6 foot, i think my great grandfather (not too sure, never met him, he passed away when i was young) was at least 7 feet. That didn't happen though, despite being in a family of giants, i'm 5'8"". At family gatherings, aside from the women and kids, i'm the shortest person. My 17 year old cousin hit a growth spurt and is now taller then me.

It bothers me, it really does. In fact, i'm pretty much always sitting so i don't have to face how much shorter i am.

I hate it, i hate feeling like this. I honestly feel like i'm damaged goods compared to them. I genuinely feel defective, i look in the mirror and i honestly feel like i just wasn't made right, like there's some kind of birth defect in me. Not just in regards to height, but in regards to bone structure and everything else. Orthopedic problems and health problems. I think i'm even starting to go bald. They're all tall, good looking guys, i'm short and have a babyface. They can all grow magnificent beards and mustaches. Like they're all german shepherds and i'm a bulldog or something.

Like i legit feel like i never actually grew into my body, i have kid hands with small feminine fingers (My mom's hands are even bigger then mine.), small feet, even my personal area didn't grow that much from childhood. Everyone on me is either childlike or feminine.

My younger cousin i mentioned has all the family's masculine features and is killing it on the dating scene. Like 2 FWB's and a handful of girlfriends. I lack any and all social confidence because of these issues. I hate it, i wish i could have some of their masculine features. Then maybe i could've gotten a girlfriend or something.

"I got pretty triggered tonight watching Season 3, Episode 10 of Adventure Time tonight. I just wanted to post about it since I don’t really have anyone to talk to that might understand.","Adventure Time has always been my favorite show, all while growing up and even now that I’m 24. I constantly seek escapes from reality. I play a lot of video games, read books, and watch shows. I love Adventure Time for a lot of reasons but as I’ve gotten older I have realized that a big reason for that is my escape tendencies. Imagining I could live in a world where all you’d have to do to find adventure is walk out your front door. It wouldn’t cost you money, you wouldn’t have to get work off, you wouldn’t have to travel far to get away from the judging eyes of society, no worries of parents to report to or check with. You could be friends with mutated candy people, a vampire, a sentient robot, princesses that rule a kingdom still gave you the time of day even though you live in a tree house and do nothing but play. Your dog is also your brother and best friend all in one package, and would be by your side no matter what. 

I love watching the show. But it triggers me in ways deeper than any conversation I’ve ever had with someone has. Trigger is the word ill use for lack of a better term. I know better than to watch anywhere near the last season, let alone the last episode unless I am ready for a weekend of staying in bed. But I wasn’t expecting to be hit as hard as I was with this episode, it wasn’t one I had paid attention to much before. The episode revolves around the pursuit of a being who can teleport, a Door Lord. He uses the power to steal precious items from people, their keepsakes, their most cherished possession. It steals Jakes baby blanket, BMO’s controller, PB’s T-shirt given to her by Marceline who is secretly just there to hang out, and Finn’s piece of PB’s hair. I seemed to be fine doing fine with the episode, it seemed just like all the others I had watched repeatedly. They had to perform a song like a “Genuine Band” to open the door to get their stuff back. Jake pretends to be the diva of the band, he make sure everyone is aware he is pretending. Marceline makes awkward jabs towards PB who reacts confused, embarrassed, and upset at the things being thrown in her face so publicly. Finn spends the episode desperately trying to get everyone to cooperate so they can open the door, and when things finally fall apart enough that everyone begins walking away from each other, he begins singing an impromptu song “What am I to you”. This is where my emotions take over.

To me the song is meant to show that even though we can spend years of our lives with people, we can still be insecure and unsure about our relationship. Am I really your best friend? Or just someone you spend your down time with while your real best friend is at work? If we weren’t brothers, would we spend this much time with each other? Would you still care about me? I’ve had these questions my whole life about every relationship I’ve ever had. Always. And I haven’t ever had a moment of clarity where I felt comfortable in my answer to those questions. 

Today, I cling desperately to any second i can spend with my brother. He spends all his time working a full time job, going to full time school, then helping his wife with their son while she goes to her job and does her school work. All while they have another baby on the way. As his brother i should be nothing but happy for him. And i am. But i am also alone. And scared. And sad. I pray that i can come over sometime on the weekend, but he explains that he and his wife work opposite shifts. The only time they spend together during the week is while they swap car keys, or make too much noise getting into bed. My brother knows my situation so he does his best to have me over on Sunday, but I can’t help but feel like i am a wedge in between two magnets pushing me back out of my brothers life. They need that time for each other. That’s how its supposed to be.

My parents spend their time doing the things that await most adults. They salvage what they can of their hardened relationship, dented with fights over money, kids, and mistakes they’ve each made. They do their best to make what’s left of their own parents life comfortable and hopefully containing some semblance of humanity, even though my Grandma wakes up most mornings not knowing where she lives or why her son isn’t there with her. They too work full time jobs, paying my sisters way through school. “At least she’s in school” they must think. Any time spent around them is full of the same questions. Why aren’t you going to church? Why can’t you go on any dates? Why don’t you spend the weekends with your friends? When are you going to try school again? 

My best friend growing up is now married. He also liked Adventure Time he always told me. The months before his wedding I was actually living with him and his parents (mine sold my childhood home and didn’t have the space for me anymore). We were going to finish Adventure Time before he was married, we never did. We had three more seasons left, but he had other priorities. He spent every minute not at work, in her arms very literally, and often on the couch in the living room i slept across from. I was supposed to be happy for him. I am. But i am also lonely. He never wanted to get married. He talked about it often, i would comment in disbelief. I would tell him how i would give everything away to be with a girl that truly loved me as much as i did her. She asked him out. We went from hanging out every Sunday and at literally any chance we had during the week. To really maybe once or twice a month. And never again once he was married. 

I have to go back to work tomorrow. Surrounded by small talk and work drama. People who call me their friend but know that the second they get out of that place, we’ll likely never talk again. My only Adventures are spent alone. And on the weekends. And usually they are me driving down the roads I’ve driven a million times, pulling over when the urge to jerk the wheel taking me over the guard rail and down the canyon becomes more than just a passing thought. Then i go back home to find an escape.",FinntheGuardian,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n60bx1/i_got_pretty_triggered_tonight_watching_season_3/

Almost okay with being completely alone,"I haven’t left the house to do anything but work and get groceries in almost 2 years. I haven’t spoken to anybody in that time either. At first, it hurt to know nobody likes me and probably never will, but I’m started to be okay with this.

I know it’s stupid at 25, but I’ve fallen back on an imaginary friend I’ve had for over 20 years now.

Now, I come home from work, smoke something or pop my sleeping pills and wrap a few pillows around my waist. Boom. It’s like she’s right there holding me close...I only wish there was a pulse.

I’m close to getting my first apartment. When I do, I’m going to try and commission someone to do a portrait of her that I can either keep by my nightstand or the wall in front of wherever my bed ends up.

Love is inauthentic,"I don’t know if I’m an edgy teenage girl or if I’m legitimately onto a good point . But love seems useless to me and inauthentic. Like your close friends only care about you when you
Have something to offer them. “We love you” as long as you’re funny , as long as you’re doing this or doing that or saying this or saying that . Or with parents they love you directly on what your grades are . Like I know parents love your”unconditionally” and they do but it’s complicated . Like they’ll work night shifts because they care about me but also hit me and are cruel and mean. With romantic love , The divorce rate is 50%.  The remaining couples don’t look happy and my parents hate each other . And romantic love is the most worthless conditional thing in existence . Boys will only
Love you for your looks , or what you
Can offer them . It’s how they are . So I’m not fond of them either . I guess my little sister, though she’s 13. I like her sure, but I’m 17 and don’t really know how to intersect with a 13 year old kid . I guess that’s the closest human thing to love. I do love my sister and she loves me , so there’s that . I’m grateful for that . That’s why I always put myself first , the realization that love is this fragile , weak , useless conditional thing for the most part is REALLY bothering me. Its crazy how people then shame young or wanting to get rich one day and own a bunch of pets . Because only pets can actually offer you legitimate love.

Difficulties speaking under pressure,"So I suffer from autism, I can't identify to what extent it affects me but I have been diagnosed and attend a high school / college for children on the spectrum. As you'd probably expect, my social skills are less than stellar; It's either nonsensical babbling or ""ums"" and ""uhs"" and ""..."". Usually I keep my head down and don't talk much anyway so it isn't a massive issue, though I would like to improve and have actual conversations with other people my age.

Then when I have an emotional crisis, it stops being so minor. I've been at the end of my rope recently, and I easily spiral into a series of negative thoughts of hopelessness, rage, self hatred and giving up. It's not like staff around school haven't noticed, because they have, and they try to accommodate me to the best of their abilities. But whenever they sit down and say ""Hey Thomas, you not feeling your best? Why? Anything we can do to help?"", I'm too scared and too weighed down to speak. I'll respond with a ""...mnghgnmngh..."" or a ""not really that good right now..."" and shut up. Other peoples' presence irritates me; I want to be on my own. Thing is, I know I cant improve without the help of others, but outside of my mood being downright determined by the cosmos, I just can't speak to people due to anxiety, depression, a lack of social skills and an inability to reconcile these feelings.

This is even worse when nobody takes active note of how I'm feeling, so I have to deal with these feelings all on my own. This is most common on Tuesdays and Thursdays when I'm not having my chosen subjects, the teach on those days is a lot more work oriented and pretty blind tbh. Because I'm unable to reach out and so addicted to this feeling of cosmic misery, I just sit there itching the skull out of my brain in agitation because mother of god I just can't deal with this somebody let me out but I can't REACH out. And when somebody *does,* I'm always reduced to a mumbling babbling wreck who can't even squeeze a single audible word before tucking my face in my arms and moaning to myself in fear.

&amp;#x200B;

The long and short of it is this: not being able to reach out when I'm feeling shitty due to my bad social skills, maybe due to being autistic, makes my life a living hell. Reaching out due to my bad social skills, maybe due to being autistic, feels like living hell. Does anybody else deal with anything similar? I'm not expecting some advice; at most, just a little bit of company so I don't feel all alone in this hell.

I want to ask my family for help, but something stops me. Sometimes I want to go to my parents and just cry while they hold me, but I feel like I should be dealing with this on my own. I'm too old to be acting like a scared kid, I don't want to burden them.
I just want to feel okay again, to feel at peace with the inevitable when it comes. It's a struggle to get some sleep because of this existential dread.

They told me that they can't understand and that i have to admit that i was lucky for all of this and because i had a family, friends, money, everything that someone could dream about.

should I take the summer off to better my mental health?,"
Hey everyone. Ive been going through a really rough 3 months with some severe depression and anxiety, especially depression. I have had MDD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years. Both of which are really bad. I took off the fall semester from school hoping I would get better and just worked, and then planned to return to school for the winter term. I tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that I unrolled from all of my classes, quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents. 

We thought things would have gotten better by now, but they’re only seeming to get worse. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high where I can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy. I feel like I can cry for hours which never used to happen. My anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with Xanax until my antidepressants start helping. 

So far in my life I’ve been on 8 different antidepressants and none have worked very well. I have just come off of Lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell. Now I’ve started taking both Wellbutrin and Sertraline, which I’m trying for a second time. 

I’m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy, I was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two, so I’m now talking to her twice a week. 

I’m having a really hard time if I should work this summer, so from when lockdown ends until end of August when I’ll move back to school. Or if I should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better. I have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me. So the money aspect isn’t a huge issue. The only part I’m struggling with is at the current summer job I have, I’m guaranteed full-time hours this year and get 3 days doing the job that pays the most in tips, and I’m concerned that if I take a year off I won’t get that next year. I’m just having a really difficult time deciding. 

I also do feel suicidal every day but not to the point where I figure out a plan to do it, more just wishing it was something I was brave enough to do &amp; then hating myself for having those thoughts.

I hope there are some therapists/scientists reading this sub,"This sub has given me more insight into depression, its patterns and commonalities, its truths &amp; intricacies experienced by so many people across the globe, so much more comfort and commiseration than I ever would have believed. I've had thoughts my whole life that I was too ashamed to talk about or didnt have the words to describe,  and here we all are, in this sub, doing it together...

Like if someone truly wants to study depression ( and they should, at this point it's kind of epidemic), this sub is waaaaay more honest and collective than any therapy session I've been to (how can you not talk about suicidal thoughts in therapy??? That makes me so mad...its such a common theme of depression, but if you even mention it, they have to hospitalize you and fk that .)

So yah I really hope someone who cares is reading thru these posts bc its way insightful about what a depressed mind looks like..then maybe we can understand it better and treat it more thoughtfully.",dedhoarse,2,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5w7sp/i_hope_there_are_some_therapistsscientists/
I hate everything about my life.,"I recently turned 30 and realized that I now hate everything about my life.

10 years ago, I felt so confident and in control of my life. I was a fun guy to be around and had lots of friends all over the world. Despite suffering from depression, I managed to have a relatively good life. I had lots of interests and had a lot of fun pursuing them.

Fast forward 10 years, now I am the most miserable anti-social fuck out there. I hate myself. I went from what I once was to a guy that no one would want to be around with zero confidence and a life completely spiraling out of control. I don't react positively or negatively to anything and nothing phases me anymore. I no longer find anything fun or worthwhile and no one wants to talk to me, and I don't blame them! I would like to say that all of this was due to depression rotting me to the core and destroying my personality, but I am sure that I am also somewhat responsible.

Now my girlfriend has decided to leave me, even though I put the little that I do have to give into this relationship and helped her with so much along the way. I have no friends in a thousand mile radius from where I now live and no matter what I do I can't find it worthwhile anymore.

I've tried years of therapy, countless medications, and just about everything I can think of to combat the fact that I've changed into a person that no one, including myself, would ever want to be around.

Even though all of this is probably a common issue and other people have it worse and typing it all out seems rather silly, I felt like I had to do it. I don't know what else to do... is there anything that you guys have found to help someone like me?",netherdream,1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n600g3/i_hate_everything_about_my_life/
"Recovering addict, ex felon. I've done everything to prove myself and I just feel like giving up.","Some back story..  all my life I've battled with depression. Teen years and early adult were rough. At 18 I got addicted to a number of prescriptions then followed by painkillers. It all helped fester a set of toxic beliefs and I took it out on my community. 
I was charged with a number of theft related crimes and was sent to prison for almost a year. 

When I got home I was determined to prove my worth. I stayed sober, still am and I've stayed straight with the law. I've reached out to make amends with family and have earned forgiveness from most people in my life. I battled through guilt and depression the first few months home from prison but honestly things fell into place so fast. I got a better job than I've ever had. In the last 4 years I've paid off 65% of my debt. So many other little accomplishments. It seemed I had escaped depression and anxiety. I truly felt so free and so optimistic about my life. 

Until a couple months ago. Started feeling really drained at work. 5 days a week, away from home for 12 hours those days. I got an interview at an hvac company my friend works at and it seemed promising. The owner seemed to really vibe with me but once I brought up the felonys it seemed over. I explained my side and what I've done since to prove I've changed but they ghosted me. 

SO now I feel trapped. I feel that even though I have changed have stayed sober and honest I'm stuck with this label and I'm stuck at this job. 
Then dogecoin happened. I bought in early but got scared and gave up. Coworkers made me feel stupid for buying so I sold. All the while they were actually buying too. 
So now I've missed out an easy 100k minimum.  Money that would have 100% cleared my wife's and my debt. With enough money to get my foot into my dream of owning my first rental property.  All while having a front seat view watching all my coworkers celebrate their ""smart"" investing. 

I've expressed my feelings to my wife and she set me up with a counselor. But honestly I just need her. I've retreated these past couple months and I fear its pushed her away. I feel like a ghost when we are home together. And honestly every time I speak it feels like she's just annoyed.

I have battled through depression before. I came out on top and these last four years I've felt free and happy. Two months its crashed down around me and I feel so sick and lost. In 4 years 6 months I've had very very little thoughts about drugs. But lately I just don't wanna feel anything and I just don't see the point anymore.",WintersDawn57,8,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5ngfu/recovering_addict_ex_felon_ive_done_everything_to/

No patience for video games I can fail at... not sure if depression or middle-age.,"Just your typical DAE post. Games that are actually hard are just... I play for escapism, so if I'm not made to feel like I'm actually powerful, or at least able to cheese my way through with savescumming, I can't stand to play.

Being told ""get good"" at this point just results in violent fantasies about very murderous ways to respond to that. Lots of impotent rage.

Most recently, my partner talked me into trying Genshin Impact. There's a lot to enjoy with ""Final Breath of the Wild Fantasy"" but I had to go into an enemy camp, still very early in the game, and one of those big fuckers who bull rush you with their shield fucked me so once before that I went into a screaming fit of self-hatred for sucking. This time I managed to cheese the game into killing off the trash mobs, and his ranged spell-using support, and we were one-on-one, and I had knocked off 2/3 of his health...

And he walked away. Back to his spawn point.

And healed fully.

And I died inside.

I am so worried with multiplayer games about how to level characters (partner is an obsessive min-maxer) that I just had them do the leveling part for me, I don't even know if there's specializations to take, it makes me so anxious.

And I haven't played anything but Baseball Mogul in weeks with a really nice computer my partner bought for me as a gift because I can't enjoy anything. And that just makes me feel that much worse because this hardware's just depreciating while I use it to doomscroll through Reddit (and semi-deliberately got myself banned from a subreddit a couple days ago to make a point). Fucking Dragon Age: Inquisition was the last game I had any real fun with, I think. And it was mostly the faction-building/castle-improving stuff that I enjoyed.

Inspirational Poem (05/05/21),"""Piglets Song"" by Benjamin Hoff

Let's find a Way today,
that can take us to tomorrow.

We'll follow that Way,
A Way like flowing water.

Let's leave behind,
the things that do not matter.

And we'll turn our lives,
to a more important chapter.

Let's take the time and try to find,
what real life has to offer.

And maybe then we'll find again,
what we had long forgotten.

Like a friend, true 'til the end,
it will help us onward.

The sun is high, the road is wide,
and it starts where we are standing.

No one knows how far it goes,
for the road is never-ending.

It goes away,
beyond what we have thought of.

It flows away,
Away like flowing water.

I lost the genetic lottery.,"Everything I do, my brother does 10 times better. While I'm failing all of my classes, he doesn't seem to have any problems maintaining his high G.P.A. While he gets to be smart, win awards, gets accepted into great high schools, I might drop out of my high school. While he has no problems making friends, I go for weeks without talking to anyone. While he has a bright future to look forward to, mine just looks bleak.

He never struggles with anything. He can perform highly on anything, without having to study. I (attempt to) study for hours on end and fail. He can learn anything with no problem, while I struggle with the easiest problems. 

I must be intellectually impaired. There is no way around it.

I will never amount to anything. I am 16 years old and have the mentality of a 12 year old. I'm not organized and have everything handed to me, yet can never learn. I lost the genetic lottery. It's that simple. He has no problem making friends and being a model student, while his older brother seems to suffer from mental ret\*rdation. I have a problem with everything.

I honestly can't name a single thing I perform even mediocre at. Nothing about me stands out. I've gotten the short end of the stick. I guess I'm just unlucky.

I (F19) am diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, ADHD and I'm showing symptoms of either BPD or Bipolar (Its hard to tell with my age and with my other diagnoses). I have be going through a downward spiral lately; going back to old self harm ways, using drugs, sex and alcohol to cope. I feel so empty and broken but yet I don't care at this point. I'm back in that dark hole that I so desperately crawled out of but now I'm just numb to the point where I don't see a point in getting better if I'm going to have to keep crawling out of this bottemless pit of having fucked up mental health. It's not worth that struggle anymore. 

I'm not suicidal at all I'm just not wanting to get help and 'fix' this 'problem' if I'm going to keep struggling.

Life goes on. 
You have to keep going.

Sure, okay, valid. But, whats the point anymore. I'm sick and tired of trying to keep going and fight these fucking demons. I'd rather let them take over or, hell, I'd even just spend my life numbing the pain with drugs, sex, and booze and suffer a tragic and painful yet preventable death from addiction.

Mental Hospitals forcing meds,"Has anyone else had the experience I had with mental hospitals where you get strong armed into taking meds?

1. You can either go voluntary or involuntary, voluntary giving you a leg up on getting out faster (ie you can sign a 72 hour notice if you agree to go voluntarily)
2. Once you’re there the extent of treatment is you see a psychiatrist for 10 minutes once a day
3. The psychiatrist ALWAYS prescribes meds
4. If you refuse the meds they threaten to take you to court and force you to take them, which also means you will stay longer while the court date is set up
5. The fastest way to get out is to take the meds and tell the psychiatrist what they want to hear

As far as I can remember (I’ve been hospitalized around 10 times) every time I went this was the policy and everyone else there was on meds without exceptions. My early few hospitalizations before my diagnoses started to get more serious I was able to refuse meds and simply act nice and the psychiatrist agreed to let me go, but as I grew older that stopped being an option. I’ve been sent to maybe 5 different mental wards in this area and prescribed at least 6 or 7 different prescriptions (usually multiple meds per prescription), none of which I can recall since I learned to just take the meds and shut up without bothering to express any interest in what they were or how they worked.

I'm such a weirdo,"So for the past two years I've been working on a story that's taken over my life and made me look seriously insane. Sad fact is that I'm totally 100% correct on this. 

When I say ""story"" one would interpret this as ""conspiracy theory"" because it's hard to believe that a random person with no professional training or experience can get something like this correct. Oddly, building this story has actually helped me put my past suicidal thoughts in remission due to what it entails. This remission I speak is basically being ""scared straight"". 

Because this story is taken as a ""conspiracy theory"", saying I'm right gets me dismissed because that's what any conspiracy theory crackpot idiot would say; it's all so very frustrating.

Some people actually believe me, but for some reason don't have the same alarm as I do (this story details first degree murder), and this bothers me more than people being kneejerk in calling me schizo. I consider that last part a badge of honor because many gifted people have had their brilliance misunderstood for mental illness.

That's not to say I have an untreated mental illness because I do from all this. It's not in the DSM-V because, again, I'm right on all this. I can't seek therapy for this because this story will have me misdiagnosed. It's not been healthy exploring it all, and believe me, I'd like to move on to make my life better. However I can't until I know some action is taken to have my story looked into and considered seriously by people who are actually trained and experienced professionals. 

Thank you for reading, and I don't know what I was going for in this post. It just might help to have someone listen to me despite how vague this post is.

at the sidelines where I'm expected to act normal inside a pretty much fucked up family. How would you feel if your already asshole Father did not turn up for a couple of months and then suddenly chats you on messenger to not be angry at him because he fucked a woman outside and suddenly got a baby as a result. He says he loves you and he will do anything that it takes to support you but you know that all of it is all bunch of lies.

how would an unemployed person who's too much of a man-child  support a family when at any difficulty he faces he always runs to his older siblings and then act like a fucking victim when he's in front of us; we're talking about a 50+ year old person here folks! 

the worse of all, my mother tries not to react just how much me and my sister tries to not say anything . whenever my 'Father' goes back home, it had become automatic that we're going to act like a happy family again. the Mom smiles as she prepares the food, the Dad and the children in their own sides of the table like one big happy fucking family. 

so here I am, all fucked up. trying my hardest at Uni so that I could finally get away from home but things just don't go as you expect it. being emotionally fucked up makes you feel unmotivated and I think that I'm even developing severe anxiety whenever I think of due dates that's creeping closer whenever I just so much as blink.

"My family keeps telling me I'm crazy even though I'm depressed and in therapy, they start phsyical fights and then blame me. I'm just really exhausted of everything","Today my sister and I got into a fist fight over a misunderstanding. She gets physical over little things, and then heated. She hasn't held a job in 10 years and she's in her mid 30 's and living off my mother's savings, she's a brat and feels entitled. I work very hard, and my field is something you have to struggle and crawl up towards, and I spent my 20's working long hours while fighting depression to get to a successful career.

I suffer from severe depression. I was suicidal a few years ago, it all goes back to my family. They're really messed up. I wouldn't call them bad people, except maybe my sister, but she's more spoilt than anything. She's come in town to visit currently.

I was handing her a plate for dinner and I had tissues in my hand. Her finger was caught between the plate and tissues and I couldn't feel it was there. She kept saying ""finger, finger"" and I didn't know what she meant. She finally said ""my finger is caught"" and instead of giving me a chance to release it, she punched me in the stomach. I told that hurt and there was no need for that. She said to ""man up"" and that ""it was just a tap"". I told her you could at least apologize and she told me ""f\*ck you"". We started arguing, and it became a fist fight.

Rest of my family came in, they started accusing me of starting it. My mother started calling me crazy. I've been alienated by the 8 or so odd people who live in this house.

My mother walked in again to argue after 30 mins and I tried to hurt myself. I started smashing my head against things and picked up some scissors to stab myself if she didn't leave. They've left me alone for now.

I've messaged my therapist back in the US and just waiting to hear from back from them.

I'm not American, but I live in the US on work visas, and again, I worked very hard to earn those work visas. My sister is a green card holder through her husband.

During the argument she started taunting me that she has a green card, and I told her you married someone and did nothing for the last 10 years, in fact they're getting divorced because it turned out they couldn't stand each other and he's already moved to Europe with some other woman. I worked my ass off to earn a visa, her having a green card means nothing compared to working 15-16 hour days Mon-Sat for years to finally get that message that it all paid off.

Due to the pandemic, I'm stuck with my family in their home country and have been for the last year. My sister and I are the only ones who don't live with the family, but she's still living in her own place. I've fallen back into depression and rejoined therapy after an incident with my mother, where she called me crazy, again.

I have nowhere to go. I don't know anyone in this place. I don't speak the language. It's a third world country so its not safe to go out at night, especially for someone like me who hasn't lived her in years and I look like a hipster. My best friend back home has been trying to calm me down over the phone all night to keep me from hurting myself.

Last month my girlfriend and I broke up in a very bad way. We were long distance for so long. One day she and I were talking about moving in together when I got back, and out of the blue I didn't hear from her for days. She just started cutting me out of her life when she felt like it, and then dragging me back in whenever she wanted. I tried talking to her about it, and she told me I was holding her back from being free by talking about it. I told her all I wanted to do was her stop treating me like I'm disposable and if she didn't want to be together talk to me about it. This started when I was hospitalized a few months ago, and she vanished on me because of something she hasn't even told me about, I don't know what happened to this day, but the 3 months I was in the hospital she just stopped talking to me even though I kept messaging and calling and telling her I need her. At one point I came close to dying because of a misstep at the hospital, a trainee didn't read my chart with my allergies and injected me with the wrong thing. A week before my sickness is when she vanished.

When I told her I was in the hospital and I'm really sick, she told me I was being dramatic and said I had other people to talk to. She'd never talked to me like that in our two years together. We were talking about moving in together the day before she disappeared...I don't know what happened.

I ended our relationship, but she called me a month later and begged me to keep her in my life and said she was sorry and that she was in a bad place and that she'll be better and she won't do this again. I still don't know what happened to her, she wouldn't tell me. And a few months later she did it again. I finally said I can't do this anymore with her coming and going from my life whenever she pleases without explanation and then expecting us to be together again when she comes back, and she took that as I'm not letting her live her life or go out with her friends, and no matter how many times or ways I explained that isn't what this was about, she wasn't listening and kept telling me I'm being dramatic. 

So we said good bye in the worst way possible. I just wanted her to stop tossing me aside without telling me why. I loved her with all my heart, and as my therapist said to me, she abused that love. I miss her so much. I really was she was still around, but the person she was last year, not who she was now, but I know people change and she isn't that person anymore.

I just really feel like holding her tight and telling her how much she meant to me right now, but we've blocked each other on every platform and from this side of the world I have no way of reaching her anymore and we don't have mutual friends.

My sister is here for another month. We were sharing a room. I don't know what to do. I'll have to sleep in our home office.

I just really want to go home. Even from where I am I can hear my sister telling them that I was ""laughing at her"" while her finger was caught and that's why she punched me. She is such a horrible person. When she came to visit me a few years back back home, we had a big heavy gate door outside my apartment complex, you had to shove it to open the door. We were walking out and I shoved it and it immediately swung back and I guess it hit her fingers. She started saying I slammed the door on her finger and I didn't even realize what happened, just like today. I told her sorry and its a big heavy door and its hard to hold open, but she kept saying I slammed the door into her hand. I told her try pushing the door herself and see, it's a big, heavy door and it was an accident. But she started screaming a storm about how I slammed it into her hand.

She's in her mid 30's and acts like a child with pity arguments and then she gets physical. She's making threats that she'll post photos of her cuts online and say it was me. I have no evidence except my word to counter that, she's the kind of petty person who would actually do that. I'm the only one in my family currently earning, she doesn't realize once my mother's well dries up, either she gets a job, or she has to deal with what my mother rations her from MY earnings I give my mom.

I don't want to be around anyone right now. I don't want to be around these people. My old therapist told me before I left the US the last time I need to find things to distract from my family, to stay away from them. They used to say these people are triggering to me and I need to find ways to keep them out of my life. I don't want to die, but I want to hurt myself.

effexor? side effects and others,"just got diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) i haven't done much reading about it but from what i understand it's not depression but something like it and you're (probably) high functioning (i am most days)

i got prescribed effexor for 8 weeks only and she told me I won't take it more than that. 
she told me it's optional but it'll give me a huge boost and make me energetic, more alive and will help with studying (i'm a med student so this is really important) but it may make me irritable at first and hard to sit down from the energy
she said if I don't take it, it's okay but i'll have to go to more therapy sessions.

what was your experience with it, what were the side effects, will 2 months give me withdrawal symptoms? do you recommend I don't take meds if they're optional or is it totally okay?",thehollowers,2,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5qqi4/effexor_side_effects_and_others/
I don't know what to do anymore at this point,"I was a happy person and always excited to wake up the next morning but it all changed January 10th 2020. My mom came home from work crying. After suffering a stroke and after multiple attempts to take his own life, my grandfather made his last attempt and suceeded. I think that's when the numbness really began for me. It started small then grew over time. I think my grandfather's death was really the decline of my happiness. After that day my grades in college began to decline drastically. I was unable to take a trip to greece during the summer that I had been planning for over a year. My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had a severe adverse effect to the second dose of the pfizer vaccine. My overall health is declining drastically, I have a constant ringing in my ear that won't stop. I can't sleep most nights because I have panic attacks. The worst of all though? My dad. Don't get me wrong, I love him so much and I always will, he's been a good father to me, he has always provided me with everything that I could ever want or need, but he has trouble expressing his emotions. He shows every emotion except happiness as anger. He's sad, irritated, mad, bored?  He yells at my mom and I. I can normally handle his outbursts because I do understand that he didn't have the best childhood. But right now in my life, I am terrified of upsetting him. One good thing that did happen to me this year was that I transfered into a private university with a large scholarship. But even that joy quickly ended for me because unfortunately  I lack the motivation that I used to have, I want to graduate but my mind refuses to function and concentrate. I try to sit down and study but I can't. Now, after my second semester, I am going to lose my scholarship. My dad already said that he wasn't going to pay for this school if I lost the scholarship, and I don't blame him, without that extra money, a full years tuition is 51k. On top of everything else that has happend in my life thus far, I now have been living in a constant state of fear and severe anxiety since Christmas. I tried my best to make good grades this semester to save my scholarship, but I was unable to concentrate and be as productive as I normally am. Now I'm just waiting for the registrars office to send me that email that I lost my scholarship. If I want to testify against the removal, I can but I'm scared that even if I explain my situation, it won't be enough to get a second chance. My worst fear is having to tell my dad that I lost the scholarship. I know he's just going to scream at me all night and make me feel more worthless than I already do. I decided to see a psychiatrist from the university, she prescribed me anti depressents but the medicine ended up worsening my anxiety so I had to get off of it. I just feel completely helpless. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I don't feel like myself. I'm so tired.",HoneyG43,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5zcy7/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_at_this_point/

Feeling out of place,"Hello everyone, I will get straight to the point. I’m male 21 years old, and Freshman in college and international student. My whole life I felt I’m out of place even in my home, I have 3 sisters and me and my father are the only males, and I never talked with them about anything in my life and the same for them, and never cared about as their brother. And I thought I might meet people here in the US that care about me and consider me as their friend, and now I have that! I have friends who care about me and they helped me when I was down. But the problem is everyday passing, I feel like I’m getting distant from them and I start thinking that the language barrier and the culture differences is making it harder everyday. There is one time I was drinking and I felt like shit and texted one of my friends who know about my depression and my trauma, and I was in his couch and he came down and told let’s walk and talk. And I told him everything happened that I have never told anyone about, even my therapist, and cried like that for the first time in my life in front of someone. And now I can’t even look at him in the eyes or talk normally without feeling like I did something I’m not supposed to do! And the last week I’m starting feeling like shit again and it worse. I’m in a new country, with no friends back home, and no friends here in the US. I thought that I met the friends I want and they care about me, but I only see them once every week and we never text or talk over the phone like friends do. Most of the time I’m looking for distraction, I don’t want to talk to anyone I want to distract myself, I want to life without thinking, I want a place that I can call home. I thought I will find a place I can fit in, I even start drinking alcohol so I can fit with people and talk with them but that didn’t help. I know my writing might be confusing, but there is a lot that I want to say and I wasn’t sure how to order them.",AdProof3211,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5vbau/feeling_out_of_place/

What to do about it?...,"I’m suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, started seeing a therapist half a year ago. Things got exceedingly worse over time, especially during the last few months. It got to a point where I just felt like I couldn’t bear with it anymore. I told my therapist about it last week and when he realised how I was doing he proposed seeing a psychiatrist and asked if I could imagine myself going into a clinic and if so he suggested putting myself on a waiting list. 

Fast forward I had the appointment today and got prescribed some meds. 

And here comes the problem...surprisingly the last three days have been a little bit better or at least I believe they feel like that and now this thought started creeping into my head “what if it’s not that bad overall, do you really need the meds or are you just taking them to go the easy way or to overdramatise your situation and be able to tell people that you had to take meds”...

I don’t know, but this thought just rumours my head all day long and even tho thinking back at some of my recent worst days, when I really knew for sure that I needed some help like medicine to continue, right now I feel like I can’t allow myself to take them without feeling or believing that the above might be the truth...it’s like I would need to be at rock bottom again to allow myself to take the help",licensed_overthinker,3,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5scz6/what_to_do_about_it/

"I (F21) don't feel happy anymore and for the first time in my life, I'm depressed.","This last month has been really hard on me. I thought that once my semester at school ended then I would be happy in the summer, but no. It's the opposite. I am genuinely miserable and now I barely want to live.

My anxiety got gradually worse each day. Main reason is because I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I thought I wanted to be a baker so I work at a bakery now but all I really managed to do was turn a hobby into a job, which was a mistake that my family warned me about. My job is cool and all but i don't think it's my passion. I get very anxious before each shift and it makes me not love the job overall. I don't know why though- my coworkers are super nice and my tasks are pretty fun- nonetheless, I still get mad anxiety about work. Trying to find something new to pursue, I bought a book about stocks and investing because it's something I want to get into. It's informative but again, anxiety takes over me because it tells me I need to confront my financial situation. I have money saved up (from the government during covid) but if I didn't have that money, I think i'd be screwed because what i make isn't enough to support my rent + everything else i spend money on. I'm studying a degree that I'm not passionate about (yes, I want to quit that but my mother won't let me.. and yes, I've tried to talk to her but it didn't work.) I think that if I were to actually find something I could realistically pursue whilst earning money and actually being happy then it would convince my mom to let me drop out of school.

But I just can't think anymore. I don't want to. It's extremely overwhelming. The thought of my unknown future is really fucking up my life. I hate working but how else am I going to make money. I don't have many friends but even the ones I have now, I don't meet due to covid and social anxiety. I can't fully immerse in exploring what I want to do in the future because of school. I just realized my UTI came back and it is making me so miserable. i don't want to spend more money on antibiotics with the possibility that my uti could come back, so now I'm anxious about that. I am a bitter person who becomes very envious of other people's happiness and success. I tried therapy for a few months and idk maybe I have to try a few different counselors before i find the right one who can help me but I have limited options (I use a specific website that makes counseling affordable and there are not many licensed therapists on this site in my area). I hate that I'm extremely frugal- I literally avoid buying certain medications because it's too expensive for me. I want to be able to buy normal things without having to think for 20 minutes about whether I want to save my money. I think the fact that my family keeps telling me to get a full time job is becoming quite stressful. I don't want to sign myself  up to a 9-5 job knowing that it will literally kill me and my mental health. I really want to live a happy life and work a job that doesn't make me so damn anxious (for literally no reason).

Seeing my boyfriend usually makes me happy but even now, it doesn't help. Might be because we have so little to do activity-wise (covid), might be because I feel bad about being with him, knowing that my depression will probably kill the mood of our relationship. I began gradually depending on him for my happiness, as much as I didn't want to. Before working as a baker, baking was my escape... and now I barely want to do it anymore because I do it for work. I don't tell him anything anymore because I can tell he doesn't know what to do or say when I mention being depressed. I don't blame him though, it's hard to know what to say to a person who doesn't have a will to live anymore.

The only thing these days that gets me through is simply going on tiktok and youtube. It's a good distraction but I'm scared I'll become addicted to isolating myself as a form of therapy.

Reddit is almost like a diary to me so I apologize if reading this was a mental trainwreck for you. There's a lot more in my head but this post will go on forever. If anyone has any helpful advice, I'd welcome it. And please don't be unnecessarily rude. I just want help. I've never been this lost and.. sad in my life. Feels like this will never end.

I wish I had someone to talk to,"Lately I've found myself frequently wishing I could talk to someone. Someone who knows as much about me as a best friend might, and who's knowledge gaps I'd be comfortable filling in. Someone who is unbiased and will give me the ""correct"" answer to questions such as:  

""Can I do more with my life?""  

""Am I a good person? Do I deserve companionship?""  

""Should I end my life now/is there any hope for me?""  

I wish I could just sit with someone and have them talk to me, answer these questions without judgment. Someone I can trust not only with my deepest secrets and fears, but also to tell me the unadulterated truth. Someone who doesn't filter their answers through the lenses of love, biology (family), or empathy (""all humans deserve love"" bullshit). Someone who can kick my ass if it needs kicking, but hug me tightly and tell me everything is going to be OK *if that indeed is the truth.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
But the truth is harder to swallow. No such person exists or will ever exist. No one has the answers to the questions I have. I will never know if I'm truly, unequivocally, without question a good person. Or deserving of a relationship I'll never have. Or if I will get that better job, more money or success. So either I act on faith that these things will come, or I give up now.

Self fueling fire,"I've never realized before, and never understood so clearly that I think I'm inherently not someone people want to be around.

They have to talk to me for work, otherwise they never would. They have to ask if I'm okay, it's to make themselves feel better. They have to say I'm smart, they don't have anything else to say to me. 

It drive isolationism. Even now that I know that I force this assumption on everyone I've ever met, I have no evidence to suggest to the contrary. I know better, but I don't feel better.

Unsure how to get out of this episode,"I am currently experiencing possibly my worst and longest episode of depression. I haven't left my bed in over a week, hardly eating, I feel too weak to shower or even sit up, brush my teeth or my hair.  My room has become disgusting and shameful, but I just feel like I can't do anything about anything. Just sleeping when I can and that's pretty much it. Lockdown is not helping, and my partner randomly left me a couple weeks back without much explanation- just an ""I don't love you"".

Currently living with my parents who are starting to give me a hard time for hiding in my room and not eating with them. All just adds to the shame. I don't know what to do to get out of this. I'm thankful when I'm able to fall asleep for a couple hours but it's full of nightmares- and when I wake up and realize where I am my heart just races and I'm usually up for the rest of the night.

Beginning to Lose Hope,"I'm looking for any advice. Was diagnosed with MDD and anxiety in September (2020). I've been struggling with depression for over 10 years now (I'm 22). Last fall, I decided to get help. I was completely against any anti-depressant/anti-psychotic, so I decided to try therapy. Therapy was helping some, but I wasn't really noticing improvement. Went to my primary care physician and explained that I had been feeling no joy/happiness/low energy/motivation/drive/and an inability to feel any sort of pleasure. She prescribed Lexapro, and I continued on with therapy. It worsened my depression to a point where I couldn't hardly get out of bed. I physically felt sick while on it. Went back 3 weeks later, and was prescribed Sertraline. Experienced horrible side effects to the point where I couldn't function. Since then, I've been under the care of a psychiatrist and have tried Desvenlafaxine (took for 2 months), Abilify, Fluoxetine (have been taking for 4 months, currently taking), Bupropion (for the low energy). Even after increasing the dosages, I have experienced no improvement in my depression/energy levels. My anxiety has gotten better, but I have almost lost all will to live. I still can't feel pleasure in anything, which is extremely bothersome. I've had to drop out of college because I can't even pick a major and get through the schooling, no passion or drive. I'm late to work everyday because I can't even get myself out of bed in the mornings. But I exercise everyday, journal, eat healthy, go to therapy once a week, take supplements.

I'm so scared because it might be the end for me...is there a way out?,"During middle school I had aspirations of going away from the environment I lived in that didn't care about school and when I finally was surrounded by people who did when I got into honors classes, it fell apart after some drama I had with a top student who I admired deeply during 8th grade, the result of which traumatized me and basically twisted my personality since then, along with giving me a distrust and hate for many of the top 10 graduates of middle school and for anyone who is in honor's classes and now IB classes. For the next 3.5 years I slacked around in school barely going outside and at one point almost never went outside for around 2 years. I regret it so badly now because now I'm 17 years old a Junior turning senior and now I realized I messed up my future(2.33 weighted GPA 2.25unweighted because I took a bunch of honors classes but barely passed most of them), stopped pursuing my interests (drawing and music I played the violin for 3 years and the viola for 2 was average at both), lost all my real friends and most importantly wasted 3 years of my high school life. Not only that but the thought that many of the people I had bad blood with are going to end up better than me in life and all I did was watch as they got more popular and smarter. 

My parents have always been weak figures in my life and do not have the capability to help me. My dad gave up on me(he cares but doesn't know what to do) and my mom isn't the brightest person and as such talking to her is near impossible since she can't understand anything complex and she has me worried about how my younger sisters will turn out. She literally thought it was fine that I barely went outside and was content because she didn't either, but look how she ended up, every time I ask her about her past she can remember almost nothing about her life because it was unremarkable. I can literally make another paragraph about her but that's not the point. 

I just don't have any family or friends to seek help or advice from since most of them ended up doing nothing with their lives and are working low pay jobs or not at all most of my cousins are the same way., with some dropping out of high school, getting pregnant early or just straight up don't care anymore.  

What should I do to make new friends, improve my deteriorating social skills and what can I do after high school?

"I've never told anyone the real reason why I've been losing weight (Trigger Warning, obviously)","Long story short, I used to be over 300 pounds due to a combination of shitty eating habits/antidepressants/lack of exercise. My only regret is that I didn't keep ""before"" pictures because I have plenty of people who look at me now and simply can't believe I was \*ever\* at that size years ago. After a few setbacks with covid, I've managed to get myself down to 161 pounds and I don't doubt that I'll hit my goal (150 pounds or even a little less) soon.

I've never told anyone this, but one of the major reasons I decided to lose weight is so I wouldn't feel like a complete jackass rejecting bigger people when it comes to relationships. In the past, I always had a hard time saying ""no thank you"" because of how I was raised and simply because I didn't want to be a hypocrite. I won't delve too far into the details (there are other places for that if I really needed to), but I wound up in an incredibly sexual/emotionally abusive relationship because of this. It made me question basically everything about myself, and every time I reflect on it, I can't believe I let that shit happen to me. You don't have to believe me. After all, we're not really at a point where males being abused is taken seriously. Some people (especially on social media) may claim things are changing, but I'm really not sure about that.

Does it make me a shitty, shallow person? Maybe to some, and I'm sure there's gonna be some nasty replies and downvotes here. That's fine, and I totally expect that. But as someone who's taking care of their body far better than they used to and tries to have a somewhat active lifestyle, I no longer feel like I'm this awful person for rejecting people double or triple my current size who have zero plans to change.",Clefty96,43,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n59l7n/ive_never_told_anyone_the_real_reason_why_ive/

Coming out saying I have depression.,"Recently I've noticed that many posts here and in r/suicidewatch have mentioned that they lost their relationships with their friends and sometimes even family due to depression. As a guy with diagnosed clinical depression and social anxiety, the thought of saying I have depression to my parents and friends petrifies me. Im afraid that they might treat me differently or might have to tip toe around me and I don't want that. I have never told anyone about this except to my sibling and 2 of my closest friends.Even both of my parents and most of my friends don't know that I have depression.My sibling was the one who helped me get into therapy and is helping me with my mental ilnesses.

So, my question is, is it worth it coming out to ur parents and maybe ur friends when u know that their is a chance that they might have negative reactions and treat u differently or in the worst cases, speak ill about u to others and in turn cause ur depression to spiral even more?

DAE with manic depression have the symptom of not eating when you are in a low? Or the opposite and shop while in a manic high? Am I crazy?,"(TW: eating disorder and manic depression)

I am currently in a mania low. Like real low. I realized today that my jeans don’t fit. I lost 5 lbs in two weeks. Usually I don’t even notice but for some reason today it got to me. I have a habit of not eating when I am in a low spot. 

Not on purpose but I am just not hungry. Then I wondered am I the only one it’s happened to? There’s really no reason for this symptom. Is it even a symptom? Does this happen to other people? Can I really forget to, or not care to, eat to the point where by the time I notice I am hungry my stomach is trying to eat itself? 

Before anyone says it I am in therapy and on medications. I am going to talk to my therapist and honestly this sub has made pay more attention to my low and high point habits. During highs I have a habit of shopping. Does anyone else make manic purchases then regret it a few days later? Seemed like I HAD to have the item in the moment. Then later I am like shit, I didn’t need that or I should have saved that money!

I’ve come to a sad realisation...,"Let me preface this with a quote from the brilliant Robin Williams:

“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it's like to feel absolutely worthless and they don't want anyone else to feel like that.” -Robin Williams

Unfortunately I’ve come to the unshakable realisation that in general society, having a serious conversation about my mental state (or even depression in general) just makes people feel uncomfortable and is entirely unproductive. *Please excuse the hypocrisy in this statement* I am unfortunately burdening you this conversation. Unfortunately it is probably fair to say this subreddit is a group of some of the saddest people. (No offence, me included)

I now believe honestly discussing these issues or reaching out for help with people I care about burdens them with additional distress and emotional pain. *It is also a strong reason though for me not committing suicide*. I would never wish to burden any of the people I care about with a fraction of the sadness and despair I feel. I feel to do so would be selfish. As I’m honestly not sure what happens after death I may as well just ride this journey of life out and see what happens... Yes, it is very possible to be depressed but not suicidal. 

##specific details / can skip if not interested##
I feel uncomfortable asking for professional help too due to just having medications continuously thrown at me like some experiment. I’ve tried probably close to 8 different antidepressants, all of which produced intolerable side effects. One particular medication turned me into a suicidal crying mess, couch potatoe who couldn’t eat anything at all. I raised concerns with my psychiatrist who was adamant it was just my depression worsening so she increased the dose and I ended up in the ICU with seizures from Serotonin Syndrome due to the psych not considering the potential reaction with two other seratonergic drugs I was prescribed. I had also lost 10kg in the two week span from not eating. Meds were changed again and I also had to take an antiepelectic drug for a couple weeks for precaution. 

Now I’m currently on Amitriptyline, an older TCA drug. It seems to have the most ‘tolerable’ side effect profile although causes excessive sweating as a side so guess what, let’s just take a medication for Parkinson’s disease off-label to try and treat that side effect. I’m 24 years old and have a pile of boxes of pills. It feels like I have a whole serving of pills every dinner (8 total each night). Unfortunately I fail to see the benefit especially when I’m taking pills to treat side effects of pills and still don’t feel better. I begin to wonder if antidepressants even work or if its no better than placebo. 

Unfortunately when all this happened I was in a military job under military health care so it was pretty much a case of take whatever the doctor/psych says or lose the job. I eventually got a med discharge for an unrelated physical injury. I’m studying to complete a degree at uni and don’t want to mess with adjusting pills during semester. Once this semester is over I want to finally ask the doc to taper me off the meds and see what I’m like. Hopefully it may even make me feel better without suffering from the numerous side effects and even the pills to treat the side effects have side effects. I’ll reassess then. 

In terms of seeking professional help I lost my faith during that while in the military. I was deceived and clearly told I was seeing an external contracted psychologist for *treatment* which should have been confidential (within legal limits). Instead, unbeknownst to me the psychologist created a *psychological evaluation* which contained information which jeopardised my job and simply wasn’t even true. In particular she claimed I expressed serious concerns about public speaking when I did formal debating as a hobby! I made an official complaint to the national registration board about poor conduct and the psychologist blamed the military. If she was knowingly conducting a psych assessment for external disclosure to my employer I believe this absolutely was deceitful and should have been disclosed from the outset. Regarding the false information, the psychologist apparently just believed it was correct at the time of writing. If she can just say whatever she allegedly ‘believes’ she could literally write anything with potentially very serious consequences for employment. 

##conclusion

I will be trying to come off all the pills at the end of this semester (with doctor guidance!) and see how I feel. Unfortunately I’ve made the realisation I just need to try my best to push through and avoid causing any distress with my family members. Yes in an ideal world it would probably be nice to believe that friends and family were close enough to discuss these things with this and they are, but I just don’t want to concern and hurt them when I don’t know what that can do.

Just feeling bad no matter what,"I hate myself, I hate every single thing that I do or don't do, I got accepted in a good collegue out of pure luck, I have a roof where to sleep, a warm bed and three meals a day and even so i feel like i don't deserve any of it, i feel like shit when im not excusing my procrastination with ""having free time"" I feel like i should be doing so much more, i should be dedicated to my career, to my friends and familiy but i don't, i feel like they just put up with me out of pure obligation.

I feel undeserving of love from anyone, im not giving anything to them, so why would they like me? Im not usefull at all.

Waking up and having this craving of ending it all because I can't do it anymore, I feel so disgusted about myself that i don't even consider living an option, like i would do a favor to the people around me if i just died and dissapeared. They would be happy, not having to deal with the problems I put on them about my self hate and sad moments.

My friends said that i should go to therapy, but would that really work? Do you just stop being someone useless and worthless and become a person that people can like and appreciate, someone people can remember as someone with a positive impact in their lifes? Can therapy really fix the mess of a person i am? I sometimes think of scaping home and killing myself by jumping of a bridge, so that people would never find me, never see me again, i don't like being seen when i feel depressed, it feels like im just being a burden, but i still want to tell them, tell them how shit i am, how useless i feel, how it would be better if i just died, nobody will care at the end of the day, so that maybe they say the same and i can confirm that i am as worthless as i feel.

I'm sure nobody would come to my funeral out of sadness about my passing, that they would go because ""its a funeral from a family member, we can't be seen as disrespectful"" not because i'm a person worth mourning

It was a beautiful sunny day - not a cloud in the sky, a perfect day for hiking. Me, Adam Ruyle, Sarah White, Mike Davis, and Jake Mills were heading out of the city to the next town, located some miles between a heavily forested area, dominated by tall, dense foliage and trees so dense and thick that it appeared as though they were blocking out the sun's rays. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and stranded. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the giggling of a lunatic... also a sickening odor like that of blood. The noise got closer to the car and it was then we heard a loud whipping sound.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a tall man, about six feet high, sticking straight up out of the water of the nearby pond. On top of his head was a tall hat with a reddish-pink ribbon. He appeared several more times, getting closer to the car. Words could not describe our fear. ''What do you think that was?'' Jake asked. ''Well, it definitely was no car, that's for sure'' said Adam. ''Maybe it's some kind of monster?'' Sarah joked. Then we just stared at each other in silence. Suddenly, everything went inexplicably silent. Not a bird chirped, not a bush rustled, not even the rain seemed to make any noise all of a sudden. I suddenly felt a pair of icy-cold hands squeeze around my stomach. ''We're dead. We died in that storm.'' Jake whimpered. ''No, no, we're going to be fine, trust me. We'll get back to town in a few hours.'' I said. ''Well, I hope so, I have a date tonight.'' said Mike. The atmosphere became less tense, and we began sharing cigarettes for the next twenty minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. That is when we panicked. All five of us grabbed our coats and went into the woods.. 'Keep together and try for the town!' I yelled.

&amp;#x200B;

After we were in the woods, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. The first scream lasted for what seemed like half a minute. I heard Adam call; ''he's got Sarah! He's got Sarah! Hey, help me! I gotta get out of here-'' - his voice was cut off in an abrupt cry.

&amp;#x200B;

The woods became eerily silent. I yelled ''Hey! Where is everyone? Adam, Sarah, Mike, where are you?'' from here on, it was just me and Jake. Jake grimaced and then fell to his knees. ''What's wrong?'' I asked him. ''Cramps.'' he said. I carried him with his arm wrapped around my neck. I carried him for what seemed like hours. Suddenly a flash of lightning illuminated the silhouette of a clearing. ''We're saved! Come on Jake, the clearing is just over the next hill.'' Then a gust of wind from the storm yanked Jake from me, causing me to fall flat on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came to, I saw Jake running ahead of me, then that tall purple clad man suddenly appeared right next to him. I got a closer look at him just before my last friend was killed. He was wearing round, large, yellow-tinted glasses. He was wearing a purple suit, with a reddish-pink bowtie. Under his purple suit was a pale yellow blouse, and he had a gap between his two upper teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a pinkish cummerbund when he appeared for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were brown.

&amp;#x200B;

From there, I must have blacked out from the shock, as the last thing I can remember is my legs burning like fire from all the running, and my insides shaking uncontrollably in fear. I honestly thought I was dead - an endless void of blackness as my mind shattered, unable to take in what I'd just witnessed. I finally made it to the town, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I walked around and was found by the rescue unit. I was in shock, and from there, I'd suffer a nervous breakdown which lasted approximately three months before I could return to work.

&amp;#x200B;

There was an employee at the rescue unit who I told my story to, he maintained eye contact with me, and nodded every couple of seconds. After I had finished, he told me in a Southern-accented drawl ''you know,'' he said, ''the world has many secrets. There is a lot we don't know about, and people don't wish to believe something such as this is truth, because they are scared to. I believe you, but there isn't much I can do.''

&amp;#x200B;

I was in hospital for a couple of days, and there were times where I contemplated if I seriously believed what I had remembered. But that's when reality kicked me in the gut and I knew that my friends were dead, and that thing/person that got them was real. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering if anyone else has had encounters with this person or thing. I'm thinking of submitting this encounter to FATE magazine where I'll go into more detail, as it shall be cathartic for me.

Too much talk about getting better and improvement. I want to talk with people who just DGAF anymore. Where are you?,"I have untreated ADHD, social anxiety, dysthimia, the works.

I just dont care. Its so much bullshit I would rather not write it all down but basically I can't do anything and just don't want to go to so called mental health professionals anymore or talk to anyone (there is no one to talk with). I realized its really not all so complicated as I made it out to be

I woke up in a good mood this week because I realized that I dont care

Because I know what makes me happy: doing wathever I want. The world doesn't owe me anything, I don't owe anything to the world. Thats my motto from now on.

Fuck jobs and education and responsibility. Carpe diem and stuff. Fuck the future, there is no future, you can drop dead right now, bye bye future. Live today

I do the bare minimum at work because I must admit being paid is kinda cool tho. 

I used to care about the environment bullshit but I have become familiar witth the efilism pseudo-philosophy. Is it cringy? maybe but I realized I dont care about anything, specially not the environment.

I'm going to order sex toys and fancy computer peripherals from amazon later. I don't earn enough that my savings will get me anywhere in life so its ok. 

I bought syrian rue seeds and acacia confusa to brew ayahuasca in my home. I was getting worried reading from experiences that I should do it properly with a shaman or trip sitter. But i have no friends and I sure as hell not traveling to the jungle to drink something i can perfectly brew in my home in 10 minutes.

If i have a bad experience so what? At least my life would have changed a little. You should do the same too

I want to talk with people like me who are fucked and just dont care. THere is no improvement or getting better. Its not real, do what you want. DOnt worry about your family, they also do whatever they want. They be fine. Lie to your employer, everyone is lying all the time. Its all one big lie, its fine.

i'm just so tired of it all,"i dont know where to begin or if anyone will even bother to read this, but thats OK if nothing else comes of it at least i will have been able to vent.  ive been struggling with depression on and off since 2007-ish.  i think it originally stemmed from an educational disability i was never diagnosed with but believe strongly that i have.  i am from a family who made it a priority to attend college, so that was forced on me from basically as soon as i can remember. i was able to ""barely"" graduate my middle school (private school with very demanding academic requirements and pressures placed on all students)  and i was at the bottom of the class and when they read out awards at graduation, i believe everyone but myself  was commended in some way academically.  my struggle was always with STEM related classes, especially math. it went far beyond the ""Oh i just hate math"" that most kids say. I was unable to do it, but somehow i made it by the skin of my teeth. It is important to note that i did have a group of friends in middle school who i was close with. When i got to highschool, it was like a weight was lifted off me. some of my friends from my middle school went to the same high school as me so i was relieved. unfortunately for me, after about 1 or 2 weeks they all found different groups or clubs to be a part of, and me struggling with severe social anxiety, was unable to be accepted into said groups. so all of my freshman year i ended up spending alone. i'd either spend lunch in the library or walking around campus looking busy. this continued thru grades 10-12, and it just became normal for me after a while. i am fortunate that i was academically much more successful in high school, likely because i did all my homework at school in lieu of being with friends or playing sports, etc.  as sad as it sounds, high school was by far the best time of my life thus far. i was able to pursue my hobbies at home without being pestered about financial obligations or societal norms/friendships by my parents. after i graduated high school, i was set to enter junior college. to make a very long story short, i was blindsided by the whole college experience.  i was able to graduate with my associates after 4 years due to not having a clear major or goal picked out. during this time i also managed to work part time. i 2017 i went to a state college and in 2020 i graduated. amazingly enough i did end up getting a bachelors degree which i was immensely proud of.  also in 2019 i began dating someone who has made me feel supported in my life choices in many regards. unfortunately, this is about where my accomplishments run out. i was laid off 3 months before graduating from state college. i didnt really care because i figured i would be able to get a nice career job shortly after graduating. so i took the severance package they offered and walked out. then the COVID hit and the world went on shutdown. the branches of the government that i was going to apply for work at all were hit with a massive hiring freeze.  so in the interim, i have been ""self employed"" which basically consists of reselling any junk i can get my hands on on sites like ebay and mercari to try and make enough money to buy food and other expenses.  i managed to build up a pretty nice nest egg, and i have been investing some of it with good results, enough to live off for now. i am relatively healthy, no major illnesses, i take no medications. i have a good relationship with my partner, who is very supportive of me. heck, i even tried to work dead end minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet, but i was overwhelmed quite quickly with the huge amount of social interaction required.  i can no longer stand to see the disappointment in my parents faces when they look at me.  at this point i dont know what to do next. i am still looking for ""career"" jobs frequently but they are few and far between. i want to move somewhere else but the real estate market is way overvalued right now so i am stuck where i am currently living. my living situation is stable, so i dont run the risk of homelessness, etc.   i just hate waking up in the morning and spending 10 hours a day just trying to make ends meet by buying, selling, buying, selling random stuff i get and trying to make money. i feel like no matter how much money i make reselling, my parents don't care at all. some weeks i have been pulling in 2500 - 3000 per week in profits but it takes me 60 hours a week, yet my parents feel its better if i was to work part time minimum wage to get back into the working world, but ive been so socially withdrawn the past 6 months especially that it would be really difficult to do, not to mention id only be making around 400 a week at max to start. i just want to get out of the rut ive been stuck in since May 2020, but some days i wish i just wont wake up. it pisses me off so much to know how much i have done in my life  and all i am able to accomplish is something i was doing without a college degree. sorry if this seems all over the place i am just venting.  its a bad feeling being told something your entire life and it not coming true. my parents told me since i was a kid that a college education would set me up for success and prosperity, but i feel like im neither of those things. at the risk of sounding arrogant, its just not worth my time to work a dead end retail job.. i've even tried applying for those menial data entry jobs that pay a few bucks more than minimum wage an hour and are full time, but i've got radio silence. i've been blown off by employment agencies too. i almost landed a job as a warehouse clerk, but i didnt have warehouse experience so i was turned down, what a fucking joke. they hire people who only have a high school degree for that crap, so it makes zero sense to me. i feel myself getting more and more bitter by the day and im beginning to develop a disdain for society and the people in it, but deep down i hate myself more than all of it. i find it hilarious that back in high school when i looked forward to the future i was actually happier and better off then than i am now. well, if anyone wants to comment ill read them. all i can do is keep applying for these jobs even though ive been turned down from over 20 now, not to mention the 100s i have heard absolutely nothing back from, all while doing my self employed gig.",Real_Mousse6180,4,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5n0lb/im_just_so_tired_of_it_all/
Someone please make the nightmare stop PLEASE,"A few years ago in my 1st year of middle school I met this girl we quickly became close friends she was there fore when I 1st started cutting she was there for me when I 1st attempted suicide. She was my best friend I loved her like a sister and I made sure she knew just how much I appreciated her. She was my everything

But about 3 years ago around the beginning of the school year in high school she started hanging out with other people while completely ignoring me. Whenever I would try to talk to her she would basically tell me to fuck off. When I tried to ask her why she was asking like this towards me she would just get angry with me. After about 3 months of her acting like this I just lost it I yelled at her for a little bit before storming off that's all it was just yelling no actual violence 

But come the next day she had apperantly told all her friends that I had her by the throat against the locjers and that I tried to rape her. The rest of the year was just pure hell as I was bullied by all her friends and everyone who heard her rumor both verbally and physically. The rumor got the principal who called the police to investigate me of course they quickly found out she was lying and dropped everything but nothing happened to her. I was being bullied so bad to the point where I would stay with the teachers (who were the only ones who actually believed I was innocent) while the halls passed as I was just too scared of being confronted by someone or worse seeing her.

They would punch me insult me for being a no good attempted rapist when I wasn't throw basketballs at my head and beat me against the stall whenever I went to the bathroom.

I tired to talk to the counselor but she just said ""don't let her get to you just smile and stay positive"". I had no one I had my GF who is been dating around a month break up with me cause she believed her lies. No one wanted to talk or interact with me because they all thought I tried to sexually assualt a girl

My mom didn't help either she just said ""you shouldn't be upset over her she's still a lady your still a gentleman you need to treat her with respect"" and when my GF broke up with me she just said ""oh so your gonna cry over this little bitch too?""

This was the lowest I've ever been in my life in fact come the last day of school I tried to overdoes on pills which obviously didn't work. 

This event left me trumatized with PTSD and a even worse mental state then I was in before.

I've switched school areas so I don't see her or her friends as often but I do rarely run into them and each time I have a episode one time it was so bad I had to call my cousin to come pick me up as I couldn't drive myself home as I was panicking that much.

What makes this all worse is that all of this was cause intentionally from someone I loved and valued more then anything else on earth

To make matters worseI found out last night that she's getting into her dream school through a early college program. to add insult to injury this is the same program I tried to get into and wasn't accepted


Upon finding this out I had a breakdown so bad I almost passed out and I held a knife in my hand for an hour contemplating stabbing myself


I don't get it why does she get to live a glorious loved filled good life while I sit here suffering

I don't understand,"I don't understand why I'm alive. I'm stupid, unfunny and no one is gonna ever love me. I'm a waste of space and a waste of life. I serve no purpose other than to pay taxes and die. No one is ever going to love me. I've been psychologically abused about relationships by my evangelical mother so much throughout my childhood that I can't even approach girls. Even if I managed to suppress my anxiety and talk to a girl, it's not like anyone's going to love me. I'm a depressed piece of shit who wants to kill himself but doesn't have the balls to go through with it. 

Of the few things that I do enjoy doing, none of them are hobbies that are ""attractive"". I can't hold an online conversation for shit. That's why even when I get a match on tinder, bumble or Ok cupid its just going to end in me fucking it up by not being able to keep a conversation going. I have so many details about myself in my bio, literally over a dozen conversation starters and I'll go to a girls profile and its "" I like food and the office! Follow my insta and dm me there"". 

First, I know what your doing btw. You just want to boost your followers on insta and you know desperate horny dudes will follow you. But even then, how am I supposed to keep a conversation going when food and the office are all you have in your bio? I genuinely don't understand. I feel so empty inside man. It's like there's an ocean inside of me just begging to get out but I can't cry it out. The best I can do is force a tear out but I can't cry. You know how badly I want to cry? I want to sit in bed and fucking wail myself to sleep every night and I can't. I don't even know what the fuck is wrong with me but it isn't right. Why can't I do the one fucking thing that's supposed to make you feel better? 

My dog was one of the few things in my life that kept me from killing myself and now he's gone. I hate being alive. I used to be non-existent. People are always scared at the idea of dying as blackness and nothing else but you know what? I wasn't a depressed piece of shit when I didn't exist. Non-existence was one of the best things I had and it's been ripped away from me. 

I don't understand you normal people. How do you have feelings and relationships? How do you wake up every day knowing your life is meaningless? I don't understand and I don't think I ever will. So I'm sitting here, going to uni for a degree I don't really care about to get a job doing something I don't care about, so I can buy things for temporary pleasure until like everything else it stops bringing me joy and I repeat the cycle until I die.

I quit.,"I’m honestly done. I really can take it anymore. I’m 15 yes, but I just don’t see what I have to love for. All I feel like is everyone fakes caring about me. I can tell this as no one ever texts me first. And I know I’ll never truly be loved. I’m lying on my couch by myself. I just don’t want to be here anymore.

Zoloft not for me,"The following takes place in May of 2014

I was diagnosed with postpartum depression with my DD, she was 4 months old at the time. I had just gotten my own place with my EH and DD. I thought that moving out of MIL’s &amp; SIL’s 2 bedroom apartment would stop the stress and harassment that they caused me but I was wrong. These individuals kept hounding me and stressing me out. I was struggling as a new mom and had very little support from EH. He always sided with MIL and SIL even when they were wrong. 

All three knew something was off so they pressured me to go to therapy when I wasn’t ready, that didn’t work out well at all. When things didn’t get better they demanded I go to a doctor and take Zoloft. When I started taking the zoloft I became worse. My EH demanded I constantly take care of the baby while he slept, so I was sleep deprived, stressed out from being a mom with ppd, and his family’s constant insistence that I was like him and suffered from bipolar disorder because I had unresolved trauma from my abusive parents…

Eventually due to all the stress and the Zoloft just not working along with a rather terrible therapist, I snapped and developed postpartum psychosis from it all. Instead of letting me sleep and helping me feel better, MIL and EH decided that the best thing for me was to go to a psych ward.

This was the wrong thing to do. Little fact, I have a major phobia of psych wards and anything regarding anything psychiatric regarding myself. Anyways, I remember when my MIL and EH were driving me there. I sat in the backseat next to my daughter and I didn’t want to go. I just needed to sleep and get off the Zoloft that I didn’t even want to take in the first place! I kept telling them I didn’t want to go but they didn’t stop the car, they didn’t take me home, they just kept driving there to the hospital.

When we got there I refused to get out, and while EH was out of the car, my MIL told me “either you go in willingly or I’ll make security drag you in.” This terrified me and I didn’t want my daughter to witness that as well as being concerned for my own safety against the security staff. I got out of the car reluctantly and we walked in. 

While we waited I kept saying how I didn’t want this, I kept voicing it, and when it was time to sign the papers I remember asking my mother in law if that is what she wanted, and she said yes so I signed the papers and they hauled me away.

I felt so ashamed and humiliated. They did the typical intake process and what made me extremely uncomfortable was being asked to remove all of my clothing. This made me so ashamed of my body and humiliated, as a rape survivor this was horrifying to me. They watched me as I got undressed and watched me as I dressed in these awful scrubs. I still hate the color of green and blue to this day because of the scrubs. 

When I got up to the ward, I saw the locked doors and panicked. I started to cry. I didn’t belong there, I needed to be at home with my daughter taking care of her. When I entered the ward I refused my medications and would do so throughout my stay. I was watched as I used a bathroom toilet, as I showered, I was never left alone and I felt humiliated. I had no sense of privacy at all, I wanted to see the doctor and get out that night. I was never really told the reason I was admitted. 

I begged to have my breast pump there because I was breastfeeding and becoming engorged. They denied me my pump due to safety concerns and gave me a shitty hand pump. It didn’t work the way I needed to, I remember sitting down on my bathroom in the ward and crying as my pump didn't work. My breastfeeding bond with my daughter was gone along with any closeness I felt towards my daughter. 

I kept begging to see the doctor and the nurse said “if you continue to push to see the doctor, you might be forced to stay longer” So they tried to get me to eat the next three days, I hardly ate at all. They gave us food but no utensils. I was so angry at my EH and MIL and I let them know that. I called and told them exactly how they betrayed me and my MIL gaslight the heck out of me. Denying my trauma and feelings.

I was so exhausted because I was terrified that I could never leave. I thought I’d never see my DD again. It was horribly depressing. They slapped a bullshit diagnosis of Bipolar type 2 disorder on me (which has been rejected by my current therapist), and started me on 300mg of Trileptal 2x a day. A prescription that my current GP was appalled that I was given as that is something he would never have given me at all even in that situation. 

Things at home weren’t easy, my DD was diagnosed as “failure to thrive” when I was breastfeeding her and supplementing with formula. I felt like a failure because I was following her doctor’s orders to the letter. When I spoke with the therapist at the ward, I told him of my situation with my DD and how I felt like a failure. This therapist, without even contacting my DD’s pediatricin, decided it would be appropriate to call CPS on me.

I called my EH to let him know what was going to happen, and the police showed up at my home. They ransacked it and told my EH that a caseworker would be by. That caseworker never came by… I was so hurt and betrayed that I sunk further into depression. I wanted out of there. After 3 days I was released and walked out to a bus stop with tickets to get home. I didn’t tell anyone I had gotten out. Not until I needed my  EH to pick me up from the bus stop I was dropped off at. 

Surprise Surprise, not only were EH and DD there but guess who was driving, MIL… I told her I just wanted to go home and be with DD, but no, my MIL insisted we go fill my trileptal prescription. So we went to Walmart and filled it. I was so spaced out but full of rage, I was close to needing to take a trileptal again but I decided not to. After we filled it out and got home, I wanted to be left alone and told my MIL to leave so I could be with my daughter. She refused to leave my home, she told me she needed to see me take the medication and I told her no. I told her the medication wasn’t for me, and she refused to leave me alone and wouldn’t stop talking to me. So I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. She still wouldn’t leave me alone so I went to the bedroom and called 911. 

They sent over two police officers, one spoke to my EH and MIL while the other spoke with me directly. He said that since my EH was on the lease, and that he wanted his mom there, she didn’t have to leave. 

The police left and shortly after my MIL left as well… The next two days were awful. My MIL and EH had decided, even before I got out of the ward, that the next two days that EH worked, I was not to be left alone. The first night my EH’s work friend’s wife watched my DD, against my will, while EH was at work. The second night my MIL watched DD, also once again against my will. For two days I was alone at night without my DD. The time I was separated from my DD destroyed my relationship with her. She was 4 months old then and is currently 7 years old now, I’ve never had a close relationship with her since all of this happened. 

As for my EH and I, we never truly recovered from that. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal, I asked him how he could do that to me, he said he was scared and let his mother take over the whole situation… We eventually divorced after having another child but in all reality the moment I stopped loving him and started hating him was the night I was admitted. 

I constantly tried to confront my MIL about how she betrayed my trust and my feelings but she constantly denied me my feelings and my trauma. She literally told me how no trust was broken. I’ve never hated her more.

Since all this, it took me 6 years to finally go to therapy with a wonderful therapist who has helped me process all this information, she agrees that I didn’t need to be in there and that MIL is very controlling. My GP did not agree with the trileptal at all being prescribed especially on a one time meeting. He and my therapist agree that I was gaslit by MIL and EH the whole time.

Don’t think this is depression. Kinda feels like it though…,"Today was a very strange day. All day I’ve been inundated with what I can only describe as feelings of memories. Like I’m trying to remember something. The feelings are rather intense but with no direction. They come randomly and wash through me and make me inhale very deeply. They stop me in my tracks. I feel it through my body. I feel like I’m a door that I know I should know what’s on the other side because I’ve been there, but where *is* that? Why do I feel this? Where’s it coming from. The only thing I can think of that my mind could be doing is trying to remember my past, my memories. Let me explain why I think this. A year and a half ago I went to the hospital. I had a small psychotic break and fell and bashed my head on the concrete getting a concussion. When I got to the hospital I had pneumonia and encephalitis. Also found out I was HIV+. Not that I think that has anything to do with my memory. I was in the ICU for a month and apparently close to death. They weren’t sure how well I’d recover cognitively. It was bad. Encephalitis and a concussion by themselves does lasting damage to the memory So I got a double dose at the same time. Everything came out of nowhere. I can’t remember my time in the ICU. My mom and little brother came to see me. I don’t reminder that. And that makes me very sad still. I also missed Thanksgiving and Christmas. But the biggest thing was my memory was Swiss cheesed. Besides no memory of the ICU, my short term memory was shit. I still have issues. Great long chunks of my long term are gone. Forever. No matter how hard I try I can’t reminder. My best friend of 26 years and my family constantly talk about things I feel, I KNOW i should know but I don’t. Parts are gone forever. And I think that’s what’s going on. I’m getting the remnants of memories… the feeling of them. No substance. Or I’m going crazy. That’s always a possibility..=] The mind is a terrifyingly wonderful thing.

I miss logging in every morning and seeing what ridiculous antics were happening that day. Going to sleep at night unconcerned with the world. Hell, just having someone to talk to without judgment.

The rolling snowball of pain that I call my life.,"Hey guys. I’ve been in this sub for a while now and I guess it’s my turn to speak. 

I’ll start with the beginning.

2012: A Star is Born

I was a freshman in high school. There wasn’t much on my mind other than the girl who sat in front of me in marine biology. I was always great at sports, so I figured I would give football and wrestling a chance. This would turn out to be one of my fondest life memories. (Other than the bullying and beatings I would take from the upperclassmen)

My grandpa died this year. He was my best friend up until then. Sitting here at 23, I’m not sure how I made it this far without you. I miss you every day. 

I met some of my closest lifelong friends this year, although they were all seniors when I was a freshman. Michael, Lucas, Nick, and Steve (for safety I changed their names). I waved these guys farewell until I would see them in a later chapter. 


2014: Memories

I guess I remember my junior year in high school as the last time I felt free. 

Zoom forward to my third year, I’m now ranked 9th in the state for wrestling and I’ve been working incredibly hard to secure an athletic scholarship. I’ve been dating the girl from my marine biology class for a year now. We’re very happy, and I’m feeling lucky to be special to someone else. I couldn’t be happier to be the guy I am today. I just got my drivers license. Thank you mom and dad. I love the 2004 Honda Accord you got for me. 

The bullying stopped this year with my sudden growth and increase in muscle. I’ve held myself to a certain standard since then. 

2015: On Top of The World!

I guess this is where the happiness started to fade.

I am now one of the best wrestlers to walk through my high school doors. I walk the hallways with my chest up and remind myself of my hard work every day. 

Still dating marine bio girl by the way. I was lucky to have had a long three year relationship with her. I miss you Layla! 

I was able to reconnect with my friends that I mentioned I met in 2012. Wow, I had no idea that Lucas had such a beautiful sister. 

2016: New Plans

The second half of my senior year! I cannot believe I made it this far. This is incredible. I had a productive wrestling season with a record of 45-8.

Marine bio girl found out that I had eyes for Lucas’ sister. I told her she was gorgeous and had nothing to worry about. 

Lucas’ sister and I became very close friends. She would be the one to carry me through the hardships of the remainder of this year. 

I didn’t get an athletic scholarship that I had been anticipating. I came to the conclusion that I would have to go to community college to avoid serious debt. 

Lastly, I graduated! I said goodbye to some close friends that I would not see again for a long time. I miss you all!

2017: I love you

Hell yeah. I just completed my first two semesters of college. Lucas and Michael are my best friends now. We hung out everyday. I picked up a hell of a weed smoking habit from hanging with them. 

I found out that I was in love with Lucas’ sister. I broke up with marine bio girl after 3 years to pursue her. We would begin dating on March 28, 2017. 

Lucas’ sister decided she would like to go away for University. I’m not sure what happened here, but I completely threw away the idea of being debt free. I take out my first student loan so I can follow her across the state. 

I moved to the university in May. I kept in close contact with Lucas and Michael throughout my entire stay.

2018: Euphoric and Motivated 

OH MY GOD I AM AT A UNIVERSITYYYY!!! I can’t believe it! This is amazing. I want every class to mean something. I began doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and started to move up really quickly! The wrestling background helped a lot. 

Lucas’ sister is beautiful as always. We are so happy. She always talks about our future kids and how we’ll be married one day. I look forward to seeing her in our free time even though she’s out making new friends.

I am so happy. 

2019: The Smile Fades

This is my junior year of college! It is blowing by. I work as a line cook and compete heavily in BJJ. I have a record of 14-1 and got my blue belt in 6 months. Thank you Professor. OSS!!

I made some amazing friends! I love them all and they taught me so much. I have Eric, Gabriel, and a few other friends in that group.

Lucas’ sister decides to return home for a year off of school. She grew up very privileged and was given that option. We did long distance. I would cry every day and we would have terrible arguments that left permanent damage. I love her so much and can’t lose her. Please help us god. 

2020: The Toughest Year of My Life

It’s January 1st. Lucas’ sister came back to school. We have a toxic relationship and yell all the time. I still love her so much and want to make it work so bad. I’ll do anything, God. Please help me. 

This is my last year of college and I am so scared. Thank god for Eric. I see him every day and he talks to me about what I need. We go out all the time with Gabriel and everyone. I love these guys. 

It’s now March. I’ve learned that I won’t be returning to school for a while because of COVID-19. Lucas’ sister has dumped me. 

It is now May. I am depressed. I cannot do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu anymore. I am unable to find an internship because nobody is hiring. I miss my family. Lucas’ sister and I are working it out. She tells me she loves me again, and I believe her. I started a job as a roofing project manager. The money is awesome and I may want to do this as a career. 

It is now September. I didn’t get an internship so I’m simulating it in a class room. I remember crying to Lucas’ sister. She made us a candle lit dinner at her place. She wore a pink dress and we took pictures. I think everything is going to be okay.

I found out today that Lucas’ sister hooked up with Gabriel, and Eric had hid it from me for quite some time. This started a manic episode from hell. 

I found a dog tied to a tree and took him in as a foster.

It is now November. I am in a pit. I do drugs often (Cocaine, LSD, Marijuana) and I become alarmingly malicious. I had sex with Eric’s girlfriend and continued to entertain her out of anger. My emotions 
are scattered. If it wasn’t for my dog, I wouldn’t be here now. My roommate had to take my gun out of my room once he heard from Lucas’ sister that I had fallen off. 

It is now December. I’m with my family. I graduated this month. 

I found out what my student loan balance was today. $62,221 for an in-state Bachelors of Arts. Guess that’s what I get for giving my parents control of the account. 

2021: 
It is now January. I quit my job as a roofing project manager. I’ll find a new job this month. 

It is now March. Guess who learned how to do options trading! I made $15,000 in one week. 

It is now April. I lost my entire bank account through options trading. I have no job. I called my parents today and asked to move back in for a bit once I get closer to the end of my lease. 



It is now May 5th, 2021. 
I am unemployed. I google search a different career path every day. I think I’ve called and hung up on 5 therapists this week. My family and friends all saw my deterioration over the last year. I don’t talk to Lucas or Michael anymore. It is hard to see them knowing that the past is gone. Gabriel and Eric are doing well, as far as I know. I think Eric is still seeing the same girl. 


Thank you to everyone who reads this. I’ve done a good job of estimating how long I’m going to live, but I’m gonna leave that part out.

I was just diagnosed with severe clinical depression and ADHD,"This is my first time posting and it's long sorry.

So the past 2 months have been awful. It all started when my parents tested positive for covid and had to be hospitalized, I helped them as best I could, and luckily they made a full recovery and are healthy now. but during that time I stopped my music classes (i am trying to be a musician and performer) stopped listening to music and would just play video games and eat junk food. This went on for about a month and stuff just kept getting worse. 

I totally shut down, I've been having issues with motivation cause of my ADHD symptoms, every time I get the ball rolling with being productive and eating right I suddenly lose all progress cause of a lack of interest and progress and have to start from square one again. I decided enough was enough and stopped all my classes, my therapy (which at the time was not helping me at all), and stopped taking my meds (i was prescribed a low dose of Prozac by my old doctor but she gave it only for a couple of weeks and said it was just to lift my mood, she never told me I had a depressive disorder and said I didn't have ADHD either. I didn't think that was right given my history but i went with what she said)

I wanted to end my life and started having extreme suicidal thoughts(I've had a history of these for the past 3 years) but didn't act on any of them instead I would just sleep for most of the day and wanted my life to just waste away with me doing nothing. 

Stuff got a bit better when i got back into csgo and started playing with my friends (it was nice to have people to talk to and do things with) but cause I was a higher rank than my friends and cause i was competitive and a bit toxic(according to them...i know that sound bad but I was really paying attention to what I was saying and doing in the game and was trying my best to just talk normally, I even told them I'd just mute my self if they were getting too uncomfortable) My friends whom I've known for years flat out told me they don't wanna hang out with me anymore and i basically stopped talking to all of them. 

I don't have many friends, to begin with, so I was basically isolated both physically and socially apart from my girlfriend. I've been with her for 2 full years and honestly, it has been amazing. recently tho she has been very weird and hurtful. she wanted me to come and meet her in a different city but just for 3-4 days and gave me very little heads up (not a problem it's just how the situation was) but then the day I was supposed to leave she called me up and told me we should break up. I took a couple of hours and started to accept it when she called up again and we ended up getting back together. she has anxiety about the future and was basically just getting super worried about where we were going.

 I ended up going to meet her and stayed at her aunt's place, we had a wonderful time and I felt I was getting a bit of my energy back, she then was diagnosed with covid and has to isolate with her dad which meant i could not video call her or have a normal call cause of how her dad is. I'd text her regularly to check how she is doing but she would slowly stop responding. Then she basically told me to stop texting her since she didn't wanna talk, i decided to give her some space and then after 5 days of zero communication i called her saying we need to talk since i was feeling quite hurt with how things were going. It was not like with the video calls, she could text easily but just didn't want to and that hurt me cause i didn't say or do anything wrong she just did not wanna text me.

I called her and she basically said we should break up again and now it's done, I was with her for 2 years and we had a very healthy relationship with open communication and we both seemed happy and now all of a sudden it's over with honestly no explanation. 

This was 4 days ago

I am so numb right now, I honestly don't feel anything anymore 

I started seeing a new psychiatrist and after 3 hours of talking about my life he straight up told me I have severe clinical depression and ADHD and has started me on SSRI treatment along with a plan for CBT therapy as well as ADHD meds when I start doing work again 

I am a college dropout, I have no friends, no partner, and have given up on living but I hope that the new treatment and therapy can help me out. I wanna know how to find new friends and make a support group but because of this pandemic, I can't really go outside to meet new people.

I don't know what the point of this post is honestly, i guess I'm just letting out emotions

I wasted 8 years of my life,"8 fucking years being unattractive mess with no friends, no partner, no nice memories, no job. I hate myself my life is shit and I am shit. Its too late now Im 28 I wasted „best” years of my life and Im too old und ugly to find a boyfriend or friends. I should just end my life. So many people have treated me like shit, i cant trust people even though i want to. Before my depression started I used to be passionate about art and music, now I dont care about anything anymore and my life is extremely shallow and boring. Even when I try to improve my situation I remind myself of how much time i have wasted, and how horrible my life has been that I loose all motivation. Im tired and want to cry and sleep all the time.

Be Creative or Be Depressed,"I might be alone in this one...but sometimes I feel like I can't be at my creative peak without my depression. I have been on anti-depressants and ADHD medication for 4 years now...alternating between dosages and brands...but I always find that as I start to even out, my ability to write or be creative is just down the toilet. 

I sometimes stop taking my medication so that I can just write a chapter and feel what my characters feel during a dark part of the story. It makes me feel so guilty because I know that my medicine helps me when it comes to dealing with people and life, but writing has always been such a facet of my life that it feels like I am giving up part of myself to not be depressed.

Too far into my career,"I’m finishing my phd in animal agriculture, and I can’t bare the thought of working in this field anymore. I started this career as a dumb young adult (17 years) by accident. I always loved animals and wanted to work in a biology related field. Some universities in my country do an admissions test in the middle of year. I took one of these universities test in animal science major mid my final year of high school just to see how I did. Unfortunately, I passed. So the logical thing was to register and begin the course in 6 months when I finished high school. I knew I didnt like the field during my undergrad, but I could not disappoint my parents and quit. In my country you can’t “switch majors”. If you want to change you have to start again from zero. So I kept going to avoid disappointing my family. I kept this mentally until getting to where I am now. I was able to get an scholarship for my graduate studies in the US, which made my parents extremely proud. And now here I am. Almost done with my phd in an area that I hate. The animal cruelty that I witnessed and that I engaged due to my profession makes me hate me and humanity. I hate myself for doing the things I did. I’m currently vegan because I cannot endorse animal agriculture any longer. This is also a secret, because people would judge me harshly for being vegan with the profession that I have. To make things worse my advisor is extremely abusive and he severely damaged my self confidence and mental health. I started believing I am stupid/dumb/incompetent because he would tell me that over and over. Now when I look in the mirror all I see is a horrible animal torturer that isn’t even good at their job. I struggle looking for jobs because everything goes back to animal abuse. The system is rotten. Humans are rotten. I am rotten. I dont want to be part of this world anymore, where we do the things we do the way we do. Whenever I express my feelings to friends they all say “find a job that doesn’t involve animal abuse!” “Be the change you want to see!”. Its all easier said than done. I have bills to pay, I don’t have extra money to use while I find this perfect job. Its hard. I cant help but think everything would be solved if I just vanished. We dont deserve this world.

First appt. with psychiatrist tomorrow. Nervous. So many negative experiences on here. What has been your experience with medication?,"Seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow for the first time. 

Funny enough, I'm not in the deepest darkest throws of depression--I got out of that through CBT therapy and EMDR trauma therapy.

But life still is grey for me and I don't feel as many emotions and just feel disconnected.

I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, and some depersonalization stuff.

"People don’t care (Suicide, depression, anxiety)","Why is is that no one cares if you are suicidal unless if it is after the announcement of your death, or if you are popular or famous? 

Why do people ignore your pleas for help but when you are dead they act like they were always there for you? 

Why am I told by my family to keep my mouth shut to not draw attention? 

I don’t understand. People don’t care about you unless you’ve got money, lots of friends, or a life of stardom. If you are a nobody like me, you get ignored. When people post about mental health awareness and then ignore others calls for help, that is fucking bullshit. Hypocrites. 

I dated this guy who’s family disliked me because of my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. They pretty much got him and my family on their side to get us to break up unless I “got my crap together” Well, guess what?

I’ve been to the ward. They treat you like a prisoner who belongs in a straight jacket 24/7 and make you want to hang yourself the first night. They don’t care about you, just the paycheck. My family barely called me. I was usually me calling them because I have no one else. They acted all sad but I knew they enjoyed that I was gone. I can only imagine them faking tears if I died just for attention. 

If I wish to not live in this world anymore, then why should I be stopped? I am not crazy.

Introduction???maybe,"Second post here. Anyway it doesn't matter ...so I really thought that 2021 will be a good year but things took a horrible turn for me . One of the good things were that I got a dog :) he is now 7 months and he is actually the main thing that brings me happiness besides games etc . My parents don't  live together however they are on good terms. But I think that the reason they aren't together is me I've always been an awful person I do not deserve them . When I was 10 my mother secretly kept telling me that she can't live with my father anymore because it was stressful for her . I've of course begged her to stay and I can't forget what she said one time : ""How can you be so selfish and want me to stay here and be sad everyday"" I gave up after that but kept a secret everything she had told me . After that she moved out and one time I accidentally said that she had been telling me that she wanted to leave when I was alone with my father ...he was so dissapointed I could tell by his face he told me that I should've told him that earlier but that was long time ago . However I keep thinking about it I was at fault no one else . January, February and March this year things got bad my father had really big problems in his job so he yelled at me because I didn't do anything right(grades,chores etc) of course that he didn't mean it but on the other hand my mother kept pushing me to study more and more although I had no motivation in doing so. All I wanted then was a friend but I got treated as a second option - I kept begging my best friend to go out with mr because I had a hard time but she kept coming up with dumb excuses every day in the last minute . I began self harming and in anger I told her through a text all she did was type ""Fine bye bye "" and we haven't talked since and I don't want to . But again it was my fault for not finding more friends for ""that one loyal friend everyone has ""  I didn't have anyone  . I've always been cold when someone wants to get closer with mr and I haven't been in a relationship because of that . Honestly I don't want to all I want is someone to tell me that I am not alone . I've always been jealous of my friend's relationship (not the old one) . I wanted to be like her or to keep her to myself since I was so pathetic I couldn't figure out what to do so I kept distracting myself  but now summer is coming and I have no idea what to do ....If I wear a T-shirt I'd just dissapoint everyone .

I need some opinions about this ..,"Hi, well, this is not exactly about depression but something that causes me a lot of stress, I think it’s something stupid but maybe if I talk about it, I can stop thinking or stressing about it. So, I have a best friend, we do some “stuff “ together if u know what I mean but at the beginning we decided just to be that, and nothing else (not sure if it relates to my problem but just in case) and I was okay with that, then fell in love but got over it, now I understand we’re just what we are but lately, he’s been on my head all the time, he doesn’t text as much just because, so we just talk when we’re on the phone , but when we’re not, he’s there, in my head, I think about what he might be doing or if I did something wrong or if I didn’t do enough the last time we talked , I overthink just a lot. I don’t know how to get over it without ruining the friendship, I’m just tired about thinking of him all the time :( I just overthink a lot all the time. He also has.. some depression and slight ocd so all the time I also worry about if he’s good or okay, or if he’s here or there, but I also don’t ask because I’m already obsessive with my thoughts.

So tired of the depression merry go round,"I’m so damn tired. I’ve made impulsive choices in love and career my whole life.

I want to try new things but I have such a record of failure I’m too afraid to invest any time or money in something new. And I don’t even know if it will make a difference anyway. Depression always makes me hate things in the end—or hate myself too much to excel anyway. 

I’m so tired of being angry and tired. I’m tired of every day being a slog and hating my job. I’m tired of an endless cycle of therapy and meds that haven’t produced results in the decades I’ve been working on this. I’m afraid I’m too old to start over again anyway. I want to quit everything and run away. But I’ve done that before and it hasn’t worked out. So I’m stuck in the endless cycle of trying to find some way to tolerate my life and the choices that got me here.

Stuck in a cycle of nothing,"For the past year I’ve found myself trapped in the routine of doing nothing almost every single day. I see so many people throughout lockdown who have learned a new skill or something similar and they all sound so motivated and fulfilled by what they’re doing. 

I started university in September but because of COVID the lectures are all online and so I just don’t bother watching them, I have no reason to get up out of bed. The only time I will be productive is if there’s a deadline the following day, so I’ll scramble to get my work done and then I’m back in the cycle. 

Despite COVID, it seems everyone except me has been going to parties and hanging out and meeting new people and have formed their groups of friends and now I’m left alone here. I have friends back where I’m from but they are hundreds of miles away. 

Sometimes I can’t even be bothered to eat. Even if I have food prepared and I don’t have to cook, I just have no interest in eating it, despite feeling hungry. 

The things I do are so pointless and bring no value to my life. I watch shows and movies I’ve already seen, over and over again. I go on my phone for SO many hours at a time just scrolling through social media or watching irrelevant videos or playing pointless games. It literally annoys me so much how much time I spend on my phone, just wasting my time, even though I know I’m doing it, and here I am doing it now. Recently I started painting, just abstract stuff or little cartoony things, and I like it, but now even doing that feels like I’m just wasting my time. Whether it’s uni work, exercise, art, cooking, etc etc, nothing feels fulfilling. 

Just before and during the start of the pandemic I hit a real low point, I lost my flat, my gf and my job all in the space of a week, and I would cry multiple times every single day, but since I’ve been at university I haven’t cried once. I don’t know why. Even when I’m sad, I just feel unable to cry.

I’m getting more frustrated with myself by the day but I just can’t help doing nothing and I don’t know why. I’m uncomfortable with the fact that I’m too comfortable with doing nothing.

Been trying to do this for a while now. I don’t expect anyone to tell me anything I haven’t heard before or even help. I just want to rant. I don’t know why I want rant but something is compelling me too. Maybe I’m wrong and I’ll hear something new that helps.,"I have had depression for 10+ years now and I don’t think I can live a life that is worth living, I don’t think that I’m going to hit a point that will make me think “ I’m glad I didn’t kill my self”. This hasn’t stopped me from trying to better myself or find some small amount of happiness, I fight very hard , but I feel like I’m constantly being shattered, putting the pieces back together, and evaluating how not to break again.
It’s very exhausting and demotivating. I’ve improved a lot at least on paper but I still am not any closer to having a taste of happiness. 

I’ve tried the medication route and perhaps I’ll try it again, but I think it really exposes my weakness cause I’ve never been able to take one long enough to see if it actually helps me. The side effects have always been too much for me, whether it be sickness, feeling cold-blooded, or the most common one getting me close to suicide. 

I’ve tried therapy quite a few times and I’m going to try again once I get the second dose of the vaccine soon. I don’t get it at all, most of the time they are just reading a list of things that help depression that I’ve read off of google or online thousands of times. Not saying the list is wrong, but having it repeated to me especially when I already do these things isn’t useful. I have yet to gain any insight or help from therapy and I’m not that smart. Or I’ll try and open up about something from my past that has bothered me, and it’s just a rant cause they won’t engage with me on the topic at all. I get though, finding a therapist that is a good fit for you isn’t easy and can take a long time and I am going to try again. 

I feel like my brain is being strangled. I’ve noticed a mental decline over the past couple of years. My ability to think has been lessened, my focus is almost non existent, my creativity which use to be one of my only escapes is extinct, I’m so slow. 

I truly don’t enjoy anything. I force myself to do things because I know the alternative is worse. I still fail sometimes to be active even though I know it will be worse for me. Hanging out with friends, going to eat, playing games, even having sex is dull and boring and empty. I don’t care what is it I just at least want an escape. 

My home environment isn’t the worst but it isn’t ideal. I have no real connections with anyone here. I’ve been at my moms house sense I graduated high-school. I love my mom and I know she loves me, but I can’t get deep with her on any subject cause it always comes back to religion and when it goes to religion it just becomes me entertaining it or more likely I just go silent and nod and just stop talking about whatever it was we were discussing. I also live with someone who isn’t toxic to me, but every time  I look at them I’m reminded of the horrible things they have done In the past to other people. I care about this person, but I think I have ptsd from certain events that have happened, even now being vague, I have a hard time talking about it. 

My friends are very important to me and I know they care about me, but they have no idea how to help and why would they? I don’t expect them to have the answers or to provide comfort but I am always confused when therapists try to get me to open up to them more. 

I have a voice that’s constantly telling me to kill myself daily and the only response I get from doctors and therapists is either them telling me how common suicidal thought are among people or some version of everyone has problems. I don’t want to diminish other peoples problems and struggles, but I don’t find comfort in hearing about people worse off than me, I truly wish everyone the best, but I’m struggling with life on a deep level and if can help others through there journey I’m more than happy to help, but I don’t know where I’m even going with this one but it makes me less trustworthy of the whole medical side of things when all they can give me are statistics about how other people hate life just as much or worse than me. 

I have so much hate for myself, because of how little I’ve progressed in life. Maybe I have an excuse , but using the excuse gets me nowhere. I can’t hold down a job no matter how much I try, I always get overwhelmed and walk out , Ive had a lot of jobs as well and I just feel so worthless and useless. I know that if my mom didn’t let me live with her I would be homeless or more likely dead. 

I could write more but I just feel exhausted from this. I haven’t given up yet but I really want to. I wish everyone the best and hope everyone finds some peace through there journey",orbofblue,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5ts4b/been_trying_to_do_this_for_a_while_now_i_dont/
Can't shake the thought of wanting to disappear out of my head.,"I've been depressed for a couple of years now, but I don't believe it's ever been this bad.

Every day I just keep thinking, *I want to die*. *I want to disappear*. *I want to end things*. I've been doing all kinds of things to get my mind off of these thoughts, but lately I've been losing the energy to do even the things I enjoyed the most. My hobbies haven't stopped being interesting to me, but rather, I think I've lost all will to do anything. I've been pretty neglectful of myself as a result, and I can't seem to get out of this funk. Everything's just been so overwhelming, and pretty much nothing good has been happening in my life, just one problem after another.

I've lost touch with most people, even those I thought were closest to me. Hell, I even got dumped, and I still haven't come to terms with that. It's not as if I didn't try to make things work, but I guess everyone else is just busy with their own lives. I don't blame them for wanting to focus on themselves, but it is pretty depressing to feel like no one cares about me or thinks about me, despite everything we've been through. At a time when I needed people by my side, I was left alone, and t's making me question whether I still have a place in this world.

I've been feeling all kinds of emotions, thinking of all sorts of things, and I don't know what to do with them. It's getting unbearable to deal with this alone. Even with medication and the frequent consults with my psychiatrist, my life just feels empty and forgotten, and well, that just makes me want to disappear for real.

At least when I'm gone, I'm free from all this burden, this loneliness, this pain. I'm just so fucking tired of my existence when I don't even seem to exist in everyone else's world.",TehBlooCat,2,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5opk0/cant_shake_the_thought_of_wanting_to_disappear/

Depression in CVS - A Short Essay," I am walking around the aisles of the drugstore aimlessly searching.

Gel insoles might make walking more comfortable and then maybe it would be easier to get out of bed and leave my apartment.

Anyone else who no longer intuitively “gets” humor?,"Externally I’ll know when to laugh, so I’m not necessarily sitting there as the one person who isn’t able to at least manufacture the appropriate response. I also can still laugh too sometimes, but it’s much more simplistically dulled. 

It literally feels like the creative, energized part of my brain (which I did have still when I was previously depressed) is flipped off. I feel literally slow, dumbed down. Things don’t really click anymore, and I’m not at all perceptive as I had been, so generally humor as a concept is just totally lost on me, despite having been someone who had been fairly sharp and witty. 

I don’t even feel sad usually, I just feel numbed and blanked out, or when I have some feelings during a day, I have a dulled neutrality, because everything’s so flat it just doesn’t negatively affect me.

I legitimately think I’m depressed in middle school,"To give you guys some context, I’m 13 and in 8th grade. This might sound like a phase or I’m just looking for attention but I honestly feel like killing myself almost 5 times a week. It’s like a constant feeling, sometimes it’s just in the back of my head and sometimes it’s the only thing I think about for hours at a time. Life feels so unsatisfying and horrible right now it feels like every day has a terrible event that ruins the rest of the day and if it’s particularly bad, the rest of the week. My parents are incredibly overbearing on me and constantly pressure me to get good grades to the point where a B is a terrible grade and I can’t go out or talk to friends until I get an A. I made the horrible choice to play some games during class on my phone and my parents took away my entire PC for 2 weeks and when I got it back they added parental controls. When I finally got my grades back up to an A I broke my elbow the day my crush asked me on a date. How fucking unlucky is that. Instead of hanging out with my crush at the mall I had to sit my ass in the hospital. After my crush asked me AGAIN I had to go on a camping trip for scouts on the weekend she asked me out. My luck seems horrible but it gets even worse. I was taking a huge test worth about 25% of my grade and when I get it back I got a fucking C on it. This isn’t even all of it, there’s even more things that happened because of my terrible luck.

"Going insane? I can't accept that things changes, can't accept to getting older and i don't want to work for living.","Hello and sorry for my english.

To be brief, let me introduce myself. I am a 33 year old man, passionate videogamer since I was 6, who does not expect anything from his life. Never had ambitions,  Just a simple man cultivating his hobby with video games, drones, radio controlled cars, gym......etc etc.

I was never interested in having a family or having children. I want to stay single, i'm not afraid to live alone, really not. I'm good with occasional sex, mostly with prostitutes.

I barely worked in my life, just few months, in a pc store years ago and as in a photograph studio, as ""helper"", at weddings or other events. Because i am basically lazy and always wanted to have much free time for my hobbies.

So i'm still under my mom's roof ( my dad died 11 y/o ago ), our house is quite big, even too much. I do house stuff to mantain it clean. So i'm in between a ""mommy-milk-sucker &amp; house-man"" mixed. In a few words, i live with my mom's salary.

But something is getting to change in a few months.....we selled the house for a brand new one, because the older one is too big, and requires constant manteinance, which also means a constant flow of money to spend.

With the occasion of having to move house in a few months, I don't know how, various awarenesses are being triggered within me, which I had ignored so far.

I have SO MUCH nostalgia of 90s, where we lived in a much better society, and more civilized.

&amp;#x200B;

The things that are making me with lower morale every day are these:

1- We have a large dog, which will no longer have the outdoor space available. We couldn't take it to the new house, and I don't know who to give it away to or what to do. I am suffer already for that loss.

2- My mother is getting old. Who will take care of her when she loses her mind, or when she won't move well anymore? She will call me every half hour to take care of chores, making my life impossible. Locking her up in a hospice costs a lot of money.  Along with a nanny, this will be too expensive.

3- Modern society sucks, i really don't like it. It's getting only about greediness, capitalism, rich getting richer, and poor getting poorer. It's not fair at all.  It's all a game about appearing, but not about being a...rich human being.

4- I can't accept to have to work for living. Work it's a form of slavery, plain and simple. A soft form of slavery. Problem is there are no alternative, other than go living under woods or become a vagrant.

5- I am not sure about this new home, Did we pick a right decision?   I'll have to get used to a new place with new neighbors and 1/5 of the outside space we had previously

6-  I can't accept getting older. I never accepted it. I want to stay young. I don't want to lose my hair, I don't want to see my skin wrinkeling, I don't want to see my teeth wearing out I don't want to lose my sexual appetite ....

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot put my thoughts in order, which increase every day. Honestly, I have planned to commit suicide  at 50 y/o more or less, which I consider the maximum age ""enjoyable"", before you get too old to live. A bullet to the head. Quick death, and bye bye to all problems. After all, we have to die sooner, or later, but i want to live when life is still enjoyable in many ways.",StIwY_,5,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5gwm1/going_insane_i_cant_accept_that_things_changes/
"Everything is looking up for me, but my suicidal thoughts are coming back","I’m committed to a college that would be great for me. I’m going to study computer science which is something I really love. I just started working my first job which is a big step for me. I’m going to school again and even going out to lunch with people sometimes.

I’ve been struggling with socializing and even now that I have the opportunities to socialize and I am actively talking to people again I still feel empty. It feels like I’m making an effort just to be like able instead of actually gaining something from these interactions. 

All of my days feel the same still. I go to school where I feel like an outcast. I come home and play video games which I later feel guilty for. 

I feel like my parents are sad because of me and it makes me feel so fucking awful. I’m scared they are going to get divorced over conflict about me. 

They go to work then come home and make dinner and watch a few shows and then go to bed. It looks miserable and I feel so bad about it. I desperately want them to be happy and I’m scared about what will happen when I leave for college. 

I don’t have anything that is making me happy. I love my family and my dog. From an outside perspective it probably looks like I’m feeling much better. On the inside I feel empty. I don’t like my friends. I’m lonely as fuck. I don’t enjoy anything I do.

(Long rant about my life) I think god has been hating me... For no reason...,"Let me tell the stupid luck in my life that I got. First off, I'm almost 18, I currently only live at my dad's because my parents broke up almost two years ago and I can bear my mother less than my father. I was falsely diagnosed with mild autism at 10 years old, only because I'm very shy with people. They also think I can hardly make friends, but it's just that obviously I'm shy, but I also try to avoid people with stupid behaviours and all resulting in me having few friends... I'm also ugly and I only used to have a girlfriend once when I was 7 until I was 13 because we stupidly forgot each other... I was lucky to even just get one even though it was only a childhood relationship. 

Since I was 10, my parents began treating me more and more like shit until it became impossible to even have a positive thought about them, like being thankful for what they've done, or just even liking them, every time, sometimes they get really horrible with me and they always have a ""reason"" to be like that every time, and then it looks like they get nice for a while to try to make me forget about what they've done before... I have a sister and most of the time, she gets treated well and they literally have a friendship-like relationship and they all try to hide the fact that they favour my sister when it's extremely obvious... Following the next year after my so called ""diagnostic"", I got a school life assistant (not sure if it's really called like that in English-speaking countries as I'm not English), which led to me getting bullied as people thought I had a handicap for my whole middleschool years, at least now since I got in highschool, I no longer have one, which is way better since it was useless anyway, but people there have been seeming to not give a shit about me, even if they sometimes do and have to care for a moment... 

Since I was 12-13, I began questioning myself about my life, and it led to me becoming a female trans (Male to Female for those confused) almost two years ago and since I began questioning myself on those things, I felt like god truly began to fully hate me and shit even more on my life and my destiny, because of course god thought ""oH dAmN ShE's beCoMinG tRanS, tHaT's aS """"bAd"""" As bEinG gAy LiKe hOw hUmANs sTaTEd tHaT i hATe lGbTq+ iN mY BiBlE, lEt'S pUnISh hEr bY mAKiNg hEr LiFe wOrSe hAHaHa"". Since then, my life has been even worse, my grades, especially in Maths and Sciences began to get bad, the only subject I'm good in is in English and my grades are still generally the same nowadays. I've been wanting to study in computer sciences, and I've decided I'll try to become a Web Developper, but with how my Maths and Sciences grades are bad, I'm pretty sure there won't be any school accepting me to study for that kind of job...

I first came out to my best friend about me being trans and then to my sister, about a little more than a year and they both accepted me and recently, I came out to my dad, and as expected, he reacted kinda badly although he was at first silent about it, but then he pretty much acted like those parents who claim they know everything and because I have no partner and have had no experience in there, he claimed that I am not trans like if it actually had a link to transexuality and gender identities... And since then, he still refers to me as a guy and he gets very transphobic when he's talking about me and also since I'm a ""guy"", he still thinks he's allowed to be violent towards me. I can still somehow get long nails altough he makes transphobic comments on them when he notices they get long enough, but at least, I managed to get a wig thanks to my sister. I don't wanna live with my mom because she's traumatised me because she once got so violent with me to the point of tearing up my pajama top of hitting my door with a hammer once (there were holes in the door after that). My mom probably doesn't know about me being trans yet. I don't know if my dad will want to kick me out someday after turning 18...

I also kinda fell in love with my best and only friend, because he's the only one who I can count on who won't tell my dad at some occasions unlike my sister and he's the only one who's there for me...

And today... I noticed I'm losing my hair that I've been wanting to grow, guess who wanted that again? It's god of course yet again, he's transphobic, so he gotta make sure my life is shitty by making it worse by making events like that! Oh damn do I love my misery life... I have no clue if my dad will even help me recover my hair although he's kinda poor...

And now I'm wondering yet again if it's even worth it to stay alive and get even more shits to land on my face while having a very slim chance of fully transitioning, getting a normal life again, doing the kind of job I want to do, and being with the man I've known for so long... I'm such a coward I know I won't easily kill myself and I know my death will sadden my best friend and my sister, but my parents will probably not care much about it... What have I done wrong to get such a poor life?

How do you get better? I want to get better if possible,"
My life is currently so fucked I feel like doing nothing not even eating. I just sit at home being depressed af. 

A year ago life was much better had a friend group, we’d be doing stuff, partying and just hanging out. Now it all changed they either moved away or don’t really meet anymore. 

I don’t even have anyone to talk to, I messaged a friend saying I’m depressed af, and he replied couple hours later saying he was busy. A childhood friend that we’ve been bestfriends forever. But I guess not anymore. 

My life currently is so dead because I’m kind of alone and I hate being so alone. Im just about living but honestly I currently hate life and each day I dread the fucking pain. I hate being this depressed I like being happy and laughing and enjoying life. 

I want to give life a chance and my question is how can I get better? I’m supposed to start some therapy shit soon but it won’t change my life for better. 

What can I do to change my life? How do I meet friends? I’m not the best at making new friends because I have some what social anxiety but it’s not severe, but I’m just unsure how to even make new friends. I’m 22 btw so I’m not even at school anymore. 

Maybe I can go travelling? I love travelling and I’d love to go somewhere to travel and maybe meet people that way. I live in UK, but I’d love to go somewhere really foreign like for example India and meet new people from different cultures . Maybe I’d see the world from a different perspective and maybe I could meet some great people that way. But idk how to even travel I don’t have that much money I have saved up currently like £3000 and maybe I could use that money to actually change my life up as that will be literally priceless.

"I know I'm a horrible person, but it's not my fault","The only thing that is keeping me alive is how sad my parents, 2 siblings,  and best friend (who I don't get to talk to very much).

Not only was I bullied when I was younger,  but I was alienated from society.  When he left in 6th grade,  I had one friend, compared to the many I had 3 years prior.  

I had to learn how to make friends again!  How to talk to others!  For all I knew,  no one cared about me except my immediate family and that best friend
. So I just said things, when I did rarely speak, that came out and and wrong. Same thing with my few actions. I knew the moment someone noticed me, they would never gave anything good to say.

In high school, I thought things would change. They did. 
I joined a friend group, albeit I felt I was a bit intrusive. Well a lot. I dont know why they accepted me, but I just stood there while they talked. Eventually, I opened up a lot more in high school, when I thought people could accept me more, and therefore care. 
No. Today I was told I dont contribute anything to the friend group, and that I would be the only guy to show up to the reunion in 20 years of our friend group.
I smiled. I nodded. Like I always do. I didnt know, like always, what to respond. 

I hope they were joking. But I know I've said stuff that made me appear mean, stupid. I don't dress well either. 
But its not my fault! Right? 
I skipped out on 3 years of being a human. I still have to think for a while when I'm about to speak to someone. 
I
I...I really thought they thought of me a friend. Someone they valued. I feel as though they just told me that that isn't true.  I mean, wouldn't they all feel better if I wasn't here? 

I've never told anyone about this. But I know that my biggest fear is being forgotten, and rejection.. That's why I am ambitious. Why I dont ask questions to my 'friends', so I want have to hear anything negative about me. I really want to join their d and d group, but I just know they don't want me, even if they say yes. Doing it just to be 'nice'.

I wouldn't want me around. I know I'm silent a lot. I know I don't really contribute that much in my friend group. I.. I mean I feel like I could be of value, if they, you know, came up to me and initiated the conversation. And I know its a lot to ask for them to imitate the conversation...man, I just want someone to want me! Please.  I'm running out energy to carry this around longer.

A sudden shift in emotions sadness to rage,"It’s interesting when you have depression and a lot of time on your hands I spend it obsessing about everything picking existence apart. I obsess about the time I’m wasting by obsessing and not doing. 
Any anger I feel quickly breaks down into hopelessness and apathetic pain.

I recently started a new job that soaks up a lot of time so I’m back to obsessing about not having enough time to do anything much less obsess about not using my time. It’s progress since I am doing more with the time I suppose. 

The anger tho... I feel it when I wake up while I work and before I sleep. Just burning and smoldering, it comes and goes but it’s consistent.

I will never get better,"I've been depressed for a long time. I'm going to be 34 years old and the first time I was diagnosed with clinical depression with social phobia was when I was 19 years old. I have been on periods of several years with psychologists and medication. I'm still the same or worse than at that time. Always fighting from day to day. Feeling really bad, being sick, but it's something that people don't understand. Since last Christmas I have a lot of daily anxiety. I work long hours, and when I finish working I don't feel like doing anything. I force myself to go to the gym 5 times a week (I've been doing this for years). I've lost more weight than I should have, and they tell me I'm very thin, but I hardly feel like eating. The doctor has sent me orfidal pills, which leave me very sleepy during the day and leave me awful to do my job.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like my job, but it has been difficult for me to get it, and I save because I don't have anyone else to help me and I need to be able to pay for a house and not see how they throw me out in a few years to die under a bridge. Every day I get worse. Between anxiety and medication, it is difficult for me to keep up and I have to spend many hours to be able to reach deadlines and even so they have already given me a couple of talks. And I smell that the following will already be a dismissal

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to drink, and I would be drinking beer or whiskey all day, and I force myself not to because unfortunately I have had family who have traveled that road and I know how badly they ended up. So I just have a couple of drinks on Sunday nights to try and get some sleep from Sunday to Monday. If I didn't force myself not to, I'd be drunk all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends, the few that I have gotten to have I have been losing over time, either because they form their own family and continue their life, or because of their distancing from my problems. It is very nice to say that in the world there are many problems of depression or suicide, but nobody wants to be touched by any of that closely or to know anything about the people who suffer from it.

Someone I have never spoken to on snapchat told me but my own fucking mother hasn’t. How saddening is that. But she did come in my room this morning to rudely tell me to do my homework and clean my room. Even last night she was extremely rude to me and talked to me in a bad tone. She told me how she buys me everything I want when I asked her to knock before coming in my room because i was on the phone with my friends. She has done a lot more this isn’t the first time and I’m getting to my breaking point. I thought of su1c1de for the first time in a while Tuesday night. I held myself while i cried to sleep and thought about everything. I also recently had my friendship of 5 years end and this is my first birthday without her. So its already hard but even harder with how my mom is being.

I have no one to talk to so I’m gonna vent to random strangers on the internet instead,"
I apologize in advance this is gonna be so long and  chaotic i have so much bottled up and need to let it out and sorry for my englisch it’s not my first language. 

So the last time i vented on reddit was 2 years ago when i was at, i think, my lowest point in life. I’m now 17 and going on here again kinda sucks cause I’m at the same mental state i was in when i was 15. The only progress i made during that time was that i stopped worrying about my appearance as much. Of course i still get those thoughts that I’m ugly sometimes but it’s really not that serious. I even started taking pictures of myself which might not sound like a big deal but from the ages 11-16 i never took any  pics of myself because i felt so ugly and felt like i ruined every picture.

Other then that nothing has changed. I still feel like shit. I literally think about killing myself every second of the day 7 days a week. Idk if I’m weird for saying it but the thought of suicide is comforting in a way?? Like knowing that if everything goes downhill i still can escape anytime by killing myself. I wouldn’t do it tho. Even tho i might feel like im so unlovable and unwanted i know that i have people in my life who love me. And thats what makes me so mad is that i know that im not alone but my brain just refuses to really see that. Thats why i wish i was completely alone so that i can end my life. I know thats fucked because there are people out there who actually have no one but here i am being privileged enough to have family and friends but wishing i didn’t. I really hate myself for thinking that way. 

Speaking of friends: my best friend of 7 years i think has been really cold and weird for the past months. In school he didn’t even look at me, he ignored my messages and a few days ago he just blocked me and since then we haven’t talked. I texted him on Snapchat asking why tf he blocked me but he ignored it. Im not blocked anymore since yesterday but he hasn’t texted me. Idk what i did tho. It sucks when your fav person just leaves u. And this isn’t the first time someone left me like that lol. 

I just feel like I’m losing everyone around me cause im too busy hating myself that i completely isolate myself. I thought i was getting better but turns out im just really good at ignoring my problems and distracting myself because i know that if i start thinking about how much i hate myself and my life i break down. But I get so angry and frustrated at the most insignificant things and then i let it out on my family and friends. Well either that or i go completely numb. Yesterday was the first time in forever since I’ve cried but then a few minutes later i got completely numb i really hate feeling that way. 

I stopped doing the things i like. I don’t even have the energy to watch anime anymore. I just lay in bed and sleep and i always feel so guilty afterwards. Well i feel guilty for feeling like that in general cause i know there are people who have it 10x worse than me.

And i hope i don’t sound dumb saying that but no one will ever notice how I’m feeling. Because my friends know me as someone who’s always making jokes, always carefree, confident etc. and they even said im cold hearted which is just not true lol. But i would never reach out to any of my friends because well first of all i wanna keep that picture that they have of me cause maybe I’ll start believing it too and start acting that way. And second of all i don’t wanna be a burden to them. I don’t want them to think that they HAVE to do something because there’s nothing they could do thats gonna cure me and i know how frustrating that is and i don’t want them to go through it. But sometimes i really need someone. I’m trying to convince myself i can do this by my own but i can’t. At least not always. If i do open up to someone which rarely happens i regret it afterwards.

the thing i noticed it that i feel weirdly comfortable in my suffering. Like i feel weird when I’m genuinely happy for a while. It feels like something is missing. I feel like theres a part of me thats missing. And because of that i have this strong feeling that I’ll never be truly happy lol.",bellaswan12,5,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5dsw3/i_have_no_one_to_talk_to_so_im_gonna_vent_to/
Support,"I don’t mean to push anyone over the edge, just venting and thinking about my personal experience and if people can relate. 

People say to reach out and lean on others when you’re experiencing depression and or suicidal thoughts. I may be jaded but I don’t think that a a majority of people can and will lend their support or shoulder during extreme lows unless you’re on the brink of depression. People often ignore signs and cries for help and when a person commits suicide they act surprised and wish they could do more. In reality they could have, not everyone is capable of reaching out but when someone becomes isolated and hard to reach or their behavior is off they continue about their lives. When they post about their difficulties they see it and move along. People say they care and they’ll help but either they don’t care or they don’t have the capacity to. Everyone is too wrapped up in their own life and problems and most people find it burdensome to have friends or family with mental illness.

Feel as if im the only gray person in a world of color (i get it if it's too much to read I just need to get my thoughts out),"I've never written on one of these before, but I just feel maybe I should finally talk about how I've felt my entire life. I am 23 and suffer from Major Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, mild alcohol use disorder and a whole bunch of additional things on my medical record. Throughout my entire life all I knew was loss and feeling of aloneness. I never adequately developed relationships with anyone close to me until I grew older and had relationships (all never worked out). I grew up in a single parent household with my mother and brother who both weren't present because he's almost 10 years older than me and my mom worked excessive hours to pay the bills so i was always alone.

 My mother is an alcoholic and just turned 9 years sober, whereas my brother is exceeding her footsteps (i struggle with alcholism as well and fortunately have only drank twice in 15 months since February 7th, 2020). I first went to therapy in 2nd grade but ended that for reasons I repressed. From a child I witnessed my brother overdose and various suicide attempts that I would watch him become unresponsive and be dead until brought back and also witnessed my mother overdose and try to take her own life all before I was 13. I remember vividly going sleepless and proceeding going to school the next day and pretend nothing happened. The first time I tried to take my own life I was 8 years old and hung myself but my mother stopped it from finishing. As years passed by I began noticing how life kept throwing hardships at me and everyone around me would be experiencing proud moments whereas I felt I was getting shitted on no matter how hard I tried to change my outcomes. When I was 15 I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety after my girlfriend at the time convinced me I should go take the ""black box test"" because I confided in her how I truly felt. Counseling never worked for me from group sessions to various therapists i never felt adequate there. I have stuck with my psychiatrist since I was 15 and the only adult patient she has. I have also been on over 25 different antidepressants in the last 8 years. None of which worked besides giving me substantial side effects.

 I have been around drugs and alcohol abuse my entire life and told myself i would not follow my family's ways but as I got older and it became more obtainable I caved in. When I was 19 I started to get into drinking and experimenting with drugs. As my friends would casually drink I noticed it was harder for me to limit myself and my self control would be diminished. As I turned 21 and I could go out and drink i would have to persuade my friends to go drink with me and buy them alcohol just so i wouldn't feel alone

. I moved to another town for my final year of undergraduate college after my college where I had been working on getting into since I was 16 shutdown my junior year (1st year after two years of community College). Here I began drinking every day and would go to class hungover or smelling like booze just to repeat the process everyday until I graduated. 
When applying for my masters a couple days later I was arrested for a DUI and dealt with losing everything in that process that made my mental health significantly worse. My school gave me the opportunity to go into the program for Art Therapy but I am on very restricted guidelines and have a much harder time finishing things because of background checks. 

Since I was arrested i only drank twice (once was my great grandfather's death anniversary and on Halloween when my ex girlfriend and me got into an argument).  
Me and my ex girlfriend were long distance, and she was there for my legal stuff aswell as dealing with her mother's health declining and eventually going into a coma and eventually passing away from covid. I am still in love with her and i know she has moved on. I was not there for her emotionally because i couldn't due to my own struggles and dealing with health problems as well. It's one of the biggest regrets I have and i failed as a partner for her because I'm an issue myself and i need to acknowledge it. 

Within the first month or my master's program my great grandmother passed away and school was not helpful with it. My great grandparents practically raised me as i spent all my school breaks and summers with them until my great grandfather passed away in 2011 (me amd my brother were his caregivers as he was blind and phsycially limited due to a stroke when I was 2). This took a huge toll on me and shitty enough I got covid a couple weeks later. Covid nearly killed me and doctors would not allow me to seek proper help because it would risk others so IV fluids and additional services I needed to potentially help me were not allowed. This took a lot of damage onto my lungs and body physically. Since then I am now considered a long-hauler and have neurological damage as well as my mental state being at it's very worst. My hands are in so much pain and i have severe tremors which makes creating art unbearable. My right side of my body lost significant strength and mobility and my nerves and nervous system are struggling tremendously. 

I am in so much emotional and physical pain my occupational, physical, speech, osteopathic doctor, and other doctors all have subtly agreed that as a 23 year old I got ""fucked up"" to the point Ive been doing things stroke patients over twice my age practice for rehabilitation. I stuttered tremendously as a child and would get made fun of and now it has came back as well as my left eye twitching and drooping at times. I never self cut until a couple months ago and each time i notice it requires more and more to feel a relief. I went from my arms to my throat and the scars make me feel worse about myself because i get looks wherever i go but i can't help it. I would overdose on benadryl nearly everyday by taking large quantities in November, but my body would just go into shock and have respiratory struggles until id pass out. 

These last couple of months I've been more suicidal than I've been even while using substances. I feel like such a burden to everyone and have failed as a sibling, partner, friend, and person in this world. I truly wish i could give my life to someone who genuinely wishes to continue living. I left out a lot of information in this post, but all i know is within the next couple of months I will end up taking my own life as my willingness to fight left a long time ago and each day my body fails me more and more.",ShadowMuerte,6,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5ci92/feel_as_if_im_the_only_gray_person_in_a_world_of/

love is not real it's just a temporary feeling that promotes reproduction and consumerism and strengthens the divide between the have and the have nots

I am hyper sensitive to just about  everything and towards just about everyone I am functionally an extraterrestrial I don't agree with the direction human ""evolution"" is going and i never did justifiably never will I have no place in the human race the history of this species is nothing to be proud of no matter who you are or how many good deeds you do

I am bored with life human behavior is nothing new it's animals pretending to care about anything besides themselves and their genetics and ability to take place in the rat race people are more barbaric than they know 

I value truth  honesty morality decency and fairness above just about everything most humans only care about their next meal or to what degree a certain action or inaction will flood their brain with pleasure chemicals and it makes me distraught  nothing makes sense  nothing is being done to seek higher purpose

I've been trying to figure about how to make things make sense studying religion philosophy psychology science i have concluded that nobody knows anything or people are just  too selfish to help each other I have prayed to several different gods and even angels and trying to contact ghosts and demons which only left me with more confusion am i real are ghost real am I in control are they in control I have been living in a psychosis/derealization stage basically my entire life

At all. I can’t remember the past two christmases or my birthday (not the day. But what all I did or didn’t do.) for context. I don’t drink, smoke, anything. And it’s terrifying me. I’ve been having arguments with my boyfriend because I’d be upset when he insisted he told me something and I was convinced he never did. 

I’m literally forgetting conversations and today we were talking and he went “you told me this 20 minutes ago. And twice yesterday.” And i just kinda stopped because I don’t know what to do. He thinks it’s stress and I’ll be okay when we’re in a less stressful time. Which yes I have been stressed but this isn’t the worst I’ve been stressed. And I don’t THINK I was having this issue before. At least with not me forgetting super recent things. I forgot he canceled a whole flight and was convinced he was going to be leaving for it and I still remember things in general and it’s just really messing with me right now. 

I have a doctors appointment next Tuesday and I called to make one and she said I already scheduled one. I literally have no memory calling to schedule one for this. I’m really scared as to why and I don’t want to tell people without having a idea as to what and how it’s being this way. Sorry if this is badly formatted or written it’s on my phone and I don’t know what to do.",Polkadotsdesign,10,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5a2vo/is_memory_loss_a_symptom_of_anxiety_or_depression/
Medication for a lack of concentration,"A little bit of context to better understand my situation :

- I’m in the second year of my Computer Scientist apprenticeship i also do a « Federal Vocational Baccalaureate » (degree that will allow me to enter without exams in the Engineering school). 

- I altern between the periods (2-5 months) of school and those of work.

So, since the beginning of the School year I’m feeling depressed and my grades have significantly dropped. I was happy to go to my December-May work period (i thought it would be easier) but thanks to covid, I’m teleworking since February. It was already hard for me to focus at work, but it’s almost impossible at home and let’s be honest i barely work.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and she prescribed me Sertralin (antidepressant) and Temesta (benzodiazepines). I didn’t took the antidepressant because their side effects (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, loss of appetite, dizziness, excessive tiredness, nervousness) are already something I’m going through everyday. And the benzo are in case of another panick attack.

I’m going back to school the 17th,I feel overwhelmed by all the projects and assignments that I was unable to do all that time. Even if I wanted it would be useless to start taking my medication now because i couldn’t handle the side effects listed before.

I thought about asking my psychiatrist for a medication to solve my lack of concentration. I tried Ritalin today, and it helped me a lot but I don’t think she would be okay with prescribing ADHD meds for someone who isn’t diagnosed with it.

So my question is, which kind of medication can help me ? (I insist on medication or a substance to take because i’ve tried a lot of different methods but nothing worked.)",souper_sad,2,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5ikb6/medication_for_a_lack_of_concentration/

Struggling to get out of bed today.,"I’ve been suffering from depression my whole life. The majority of time my medication controls it and I am fine. Occasionally, I have these severe bouts of depression that I just can’t seem to shake. This recent episode was triggered by some family visiting. Now, I can’t even get out of bed. My children need me and my to do list is miles long. The thought of getting out of bed makes me absolutely sick though. I honestly can’t even imagine getting up and getting dressed. The longer I sit here, the more guilty I feel. My family needs me and I’m just a shell. What’s the first step? What can I do to motivate myself to get up?

It seems that high didn't lasted that long...,"It has not even been two weeks I was here happy to share about how I got a job I like and things were getting better, and then it seems everything is getting downhill...  

Demands started to pile up, and so my mental health started to take a dive. Is an obvious fact that I'm pretty average to bad at my job, but I was trying to hold on to that thought that most people are, and that doing good enough would probably be enough.  

The meaninglessness of my own existence and how I'm just trying to find a way to live just because I was never able to do some more deadlier to end my life started to haunt me again. I had a mental breakdown on the weekend (which has been the most demanding day at my job, physically speaking), which didn't helped. Just made me realize my depression is far from gone.  

Now, in the past couple of days there has been some tension from one of my bosses. He is a bit rude and aggressive, and due to some mistakes I made (nothing major really, and some of those were not even completely my fault), and today after he just reminded me that I'm still in the 90 days experience, that there is some chance this doesn't work out I just break down again.  

This is not a hard job, but I'm still struggling at it. I can't stop feeling a bit sad when I wake up every day knowing that there is maybe a chance that everything gets worse than it is right now.  

I have been flooded by suicidal thoughts once again. I could just jump from a 30.000 feet fall, but I'm too much of a coward to build the strength to do so. I may shock myself on a high voltage cable, seems way less difficult to do so.  

I wish I wasn't getting those thoughts, those urges, but I'm afraid that the longer I live, the bigger will be the chance of making a worse mistake and losing what I got for now.  

I wish some God, or Devil, or something would just take me from this existence. But it seems that if there is someone beyond this realm listening, he just decided to not care enough if not to answer my plea, to at least give peace to my mind.",theblackbarth,2,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5hr6i/it_seems_that_high_didnt_lasted_that_long/

I've been googling ""how to kill yourself without anyone noticing"" because I really don't want to hurt them. I also think about my cat. I have decided on the method but I don't want my cat to go through anything so I'll send her to a posh cat hotel and pay for a few days stay. Then I'll program an email so in a few days a friend gets the inform regarding how to pick my cat up. A couple of weeks ago I lost the love of my life and he does not want to get back together with me. I've pleaded and screamed and begged and obviously that has done nothing. I don't blame him.

This poem from my favorite show Bojack Horseman helped me in dark times. I figured I share it to the few of you who see this and maybe it will help like it did for me,"View From Halfway Down

The weak breeze whispers nothing
the water screams sublime.
His feet shift, teeter-totter
deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.
Toes untouch the overpass
soon he’s water-bound.
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
the view from halfway down.
A little wind, a summer sun
a river rich and regal.
A flood of fond endorphins
brings a calm that knows no equal.
You’re flying now, you see things
much more clear than from the ground.
It's all okay, or it would be
were you not now halfway down.
Thrash to break from gravity
what now could slow the drop?
All I’d give for toes to touch
the safety back at top.
But this is it, the deed is done
silence drowns the sound.
Before I leaped I should've seen
the view from halfway down.
I really should’ve thought about
the view from halfway down.
I wish I could've known about
the view from halfway down

My happiness is dependent on a person,"This is my first time actually using this app so hopefully I’m doing this right. The reason I’m trying this out is because a lot of times when I’m dealing with emotional stress and other issues I like to go online and find other people that are going through difficult times as well. Hopefully I can connect with someone going through a similar situation as me. Anyways, a little about me. I’ll be drinking age soon. I’m currently in college (everything’s online). I’m actually really considering dropping out because I don’t have an actual goal in mind of what career I want to get into. People always tell me that that’s okay, that a lot of people change majors multiples times in college. That’s cool and everything, but it doesn’t take away the feeling that I’m wasting my time and money on something I’m not motivated to do. I want to be able to get a good job in the future, and I know that going go to college will make it easier for me, but so far all I’ve taken are some prerequisite classes that I hate doing. I just want spring term to end. Anyways, that’s not the point of this so moving on. I live with only 1 of my parents, my other parent has been absent for about 5 years. Growing up, my parents would fight a lot. It got to the point of physical and emotional abuse; I won’t bore you with the details, but my parents tried to fix their issues and they never could, so one of them decided to leave and that explains why I only live with one. With a dysfunctional family like this, they really aren’t the people that I would open up to. I love them and everything, but it just doesn’t feel right. Growing up this took a toll on younger me. Some days I would really dread having to come home to fighting and yelling. I think this explains why as a kid, I really loved school. It was a place where I could escape from my house and I could laugh and have fun with all my friends and forget about the things that happened at home. I was probably the only kid that felt downright miserable on the last day of school. This little trait of mine even followed me into high school, and on the day of graduation, it was super hard for me to accept that I was never going back to the place where I found solace as a kid. A lot of people really enjoy the idea of “freedom” that comes with graduating, but I rarely leave my house or go to parties or social events, so to me this “freedom” is really just me feeling so incredibly bored, feeling aimless, sometimes hopeless, with no real support system, no promising future to look forward to, really nothing at all. I can’t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or if I’ve ever been happy to begin with. It was during this gloomy time of my life that started talking to someone I met online. At first I was just looking for something to ease the boredom, but as time went on I found that I actually really enjoyed talking to this person. They were funny, caring, sweet, just a really great person overall. And it didn’t hurt that they were attractive too lol. We started talking more and more and it got to the point one day where we both confessed we had feelings for each other. I always thought LDRs were weird and I didn’t see how someone could be in one, but there I was, actually getting into one lol. I actually felt for once that I could say I was happy. But like many other LDRs, it didn’t last. We broke things off and stopped talking for bit. I don’t know if the person reading this has ever experienced something like that, but when you get really used to having someone in your life, and one day they abruptly get up and leave, it really sucks. Really really sucks. If I felt hopeless and alone before, you can imagine how I was feeling then. I had someone in my life that genuinely made my days so much better and they were gone. The best way I can describe it is just emptiness. A numb feeling in your whole body that makes you lose the motivation to do anything at all. I had a hard time functioning, I had a week left at this one job but I quit early because I couldn’t make myself go. I barely ate. Grades started slipping. I felt like that for a week or two until told myself I would move on. I started talking to a bunch of new people but all that really did was make me feel worse because deep down I knew they couldn’t replace. It was around this time that me and the person talked things out between us and we agreed that we would continue talking just as friends. That was a while back. We’re still talking today but there’s still something that really troubles me. I’ve realized that my mood is really dependent on that person. If we talk normally I find myself feeling fine, but if days go by where we don’t really talk I find myself feeling agitated and anxious. I’m scared to lose them again. So basically my “happiness” depends on them, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to stop talking to them because I know that horrible empty feeling will come back again, but at the same time I know that what I’m going through isn’t healthy for me.

My mom is ruining my life,"Excuse my language, but my mom is such a narcissistic cunt. 

A few years ago, she told me and my siblings she had been abused as a girl and has depression. Having depression and anxiety, I understand how she feels. However, as the years have passed, she has turned into someone who always wants to be right, in control, in the spotlight, and the center of attention. 

She’s always made excuses for being a bitch. “I’m tired.” “I do so much for you and you are being ungrateful.” “How do you think I feel?” 

Just to get pity from others, she shares personal information with strangers to get a reaction. She posts everything about her “perfect family” on Facebook when I know we are broken. I swear she wants to be a teenager again so bad. She joined tiktok and posts everything. She never asks her kids for permission to post ugly pictures of us just for likes. 

She constantly makes comments on our appearances such as our weight and outfits. She puts us down for not striving for the life she wants. She’s pretty much forcing my oldest sibling to live the life she never got. 

I even attempted suicide because i hate life so much, and she turned the attention on herself and made sure to tell me I put the family through hell. She calls me lazy, a Debbie downer, weird, out of place, and more. Whenever I’m at the doctors office she always wants to answer questions directed to me. I want to tell her to stop making assumptions about who I am. I shaved my head and she called me a neo-nazi. She said I looked like a boy. She tells me I don’t have a reason to be depressed or suicidal because I don’t know what it is and that I’ve never been through her kind of trauma. She says I will do horribly in the real world because I have Aspergers. She treats me like dirt. She’s so two-faced. To others, she puts up and act where she is the perfect model mother when in reality she is a jealous, emotionally abusive asshole. She treats me like a baby.

Messy room messy life,"This whole post will be as unorganised as my life. I just want to rant. Thank you to anyone that reads. 

Since breaking up with my ex around September last year, quitting my job and absolutely shutting myself in, I have not cleaned my room once or even attempted to. I packed all of my things up from his house a month after I had moved back to mum’s, because I’d rather live with the clothes out of mum’s closet was than face the task. I dumped all of the bags of clothes on my bedroom floor and said to mum “I’ll pack later.” It’s now been 8 months and a lot of the bags have been searched through by me, to find something specific then leave everything in a huge mess. The only floor space in my room is the entry from the doorway to my bed. I feel so bad for my poor mother having to walk past my shit storm of a room every single day, I can’t imagine how helpless she feels because her 20 year old child won’t do anything about it. All I do is play games and sleep. My entire life revolves around my internet friends. I do keep in touch with my irl friends though I don’t talk to or hang out with them as much as my internet friends that live an ocean away. Mum started realising that I won’t eat unless she puts food in front of me. It’s not that I don’t want to, I just don’t feel like taking care of myself. I even went a month without showering when the average is usually 1 week. Everything self care related is so hard. I managed to quit smoking after smoking everyday for 3 years but I am still vaping. I’m 21 in a month and have never felt as helpless as ever. We are moving houses soon and I am absolutely dreading packing. I’d rather pay someone to do that for me but I’d be too anxious about some random person touching my belongings. I don’t know where to start though I know it will be a good new start, the feeling of cleaning up my room is dreadful. My doctor has just been feeding me lorazepam and quetiapine; knocks me out cold. I’ve been drinking 2 times a week but it was worse in the beginning, almost every day for a month. I don’t do anything to make myself better. I physically can’t and don’t want to. I bought roller skates on a whim but those were used twice then left to rot with the rest of the clutter in my room. I could never thank my mother enough for being my rock.

Situational depression,"I feel guilty for being on here sometimes because I realise there's so many people who have been struggling for longer and in worse places than me without clear reasons. My problems are all my fault, I've lost my partner, friends, my job and my house but I'm mentally + physically so low right now.

My doctor said this is called situational depression and many of my feelings are due to a lack of resolution to my problems but I have no motivation to fix or change things. I just wish I could go back to a while ago when I was actually happy but nothing seems fixable and change is no guarantee of happiness.",Matt3865,2,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n5flgz/situational_depression/

I need your opinion about a statement…,"***TRIGGER WARNING - mentions of suicide/death










So last night me and my gf got in an argument. I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and ideation. I haven’t gone as far as making a plan for it or anything because I’m scared of the pain of death. So during this argument I mention that I don’t want to be here anymore and I just can’t do it several times (having a meltdown), and she says the following:

“You’re talking about it which means you want help. I’ve been suicidal before and I just got quiet. People who are really going to do it don’t talk about it, they just get quiet.” - this may not be exactly word for word but it’s 95% accurate. 

After that, I became extremely hurt because that statement made it seem like since I’m talking about it then it means I’m not really gonna do it and I felt like it Implies that experience is not at “authentic” as someone who “is really gonna do it”. I tried to explain to her that the statement IMPLIES that my experience with suicide is not real or as important or serious as someone who has a plan and commits to it. She just kept telling me I was twisting her words when I didn’t. I believe most people put priority on what’s IMPLIED by a statement or question over what the statement or question LITERALLY says.

How do y’all get up day after day and keep going?,"I’ve been at this depression/anxiety thing for a while, and it’s wearing on me. By most measures I’ve got a pretty good life, I just don’t know how to be happy anymore. The isolation and loneliness are starting to get to me I guess, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it. I just get up, work most of the day, maybe goof off on Xbox or something for a bit if I have time, and I sleep. There’s no break from the pattern, it’s constant, and I feel like it’s slowly killing me. 

I feel selfish for even feeling this way because so many people have more on their plate. My stress doesn’t come from money, or family, or relationships, I’m just never happy anymore.

My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",pain_in_the-anus,1151,86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6kr5j/my_therapist_recently_taught_me_a_trick_that_has/

Lexapro is a game changer!,"Hey guys or gals so I’m on day 11 of Lexapro and it is a game changer. I’ve had severe severe anxiety for about a year and everyday was a constant battle... I was afraid of the dark and couldn’t sleep earlier then 7am and it was destroying my social life.. I started taking Lexapro and the first week was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. My already debilitating anxiety was like 3x worse I was having a constant panic attack for hours out of each day. I was experiencing insomnia, upset stomach, dizziness, sweats etc. But I decided to stick it out because I know this can happen. Suddenly day 8 roles around I take my pill and something was different the side effects completely went away and I slept like 6 hours. Ever since day 8 everything has been getting better and the length of sleep is increasing. I’m struggling to figure out if it was completely the pill or the fact that I’m forcing myself to go for walks etc but my life has changed almost overnight... I’m going to sleep no later then 12 at night with minimal anxiety. Don’t get me wrong I still get a little anticipatory anxiety for the night but once it’s time I’m way to tired to give a crap.. just wanted to share my story for those struggling with the side effects and who are debating quitting I’m telling you stick it out!

a helpful tip to help during panic attacks by my therapist,"my therapist recently taught me a really helpful trick to help during panic attacks and last night i had one and it actually helped me. She said to write yourself a really small note telling yourself that you’re not dying and to breathe and relax and that’s it will pass  (because that’s what makes me panic a lot of the times since panic attack and heart attack symptoms are so similar). A lot of the times it’s hard for me to think logically when i’m anxious or having a panic attack and i just assume that i’m going to die so reading a note to yourself from when you were capable of thinking logically helps a lot! You can write anything in the note that you know might help you feel better, breathe, and calm down. I wrote a small one that I carry in my wallet so i always have it with me.

Trying to find words to describe the physical 'foggy' sensation I feel when I'm in bouts of big anxiety. Anyone else experience this?,"Anxiety comes and goes, is big sometimes and small sometimes. I'm trying to learn how to identify where my anxiety is in a given moment, and my therapist recently asked ""what physical sensations are clues?""

I get this feeling of what I can only describe as 'fog'. Like my brain is underwater and needs to work extra hard to make connections. Like my eyes need to work extra hard to really see things. Like I have to remember sometimes ""these surroundings I'm seeing right now, I'm here too. I'm not just looking at things- I'm *here*"". 

I don't mean in a literal sense; things don't actually look fogged over, but that's the best way I can describe the feeling so far.

Just had a 5 minute conversation over the phone with the doctor. Worst experience of my life.,"I have just moved to a new area and my anxiety had flared up again. I decided to book a telephone consultation with my new doctor to discuss some options. As many of you know, it takes more than 3 minutes to describe symptoms.

I explained my blood pressure is an issue as I can not stand up without going dizzy and my veins pop out of my hands on a regular basis, suggesting unregulated blood pressure. The doctor snapped 'there is no way for you to know that, you need to come in and get checked' yeah I know this. You told me to do it over the phone. 

I then talked about my palpatations and he offered me a number for CBT. I explained CBT did not work when I last tried, I again explained about my issues with being social for the doctor to tell me I'm repeating myself. 

Tried telling him I do not feel comfortable in my own home and going out, he cuts me off and says he is sending me a prescription, didn't say what for didn't say the name of the meds or anything.

I feel like I have just been pushed through some machine and come out doped up. I wanted a conversation and now it's a safe bet I will never call that asshole of a doctor again.

Does anyone else dread spending time with their family?,"I dread spending time with my family. I have nothing against my family. I have no legitimate reason to. I simply dont get along with them and i dont enjoy their company, like when you are forced in a group project with students you never talk to because you dont get along, thats what it feels like. In life we usually have a choice who we spend time with and are friends with but with family its different, i cant just pick and choose who im blood related to. In social situations i feel so pressured to speak and be present. Im still young and live at my moms house, just me and her and she often goes to see her boyfriend so im alone most of the time, when she is home i feel no pressure to be social and be her company. I feel comfortable and relaxed knowing i can stroll around and do my thing. 

Tomorrow is my grandpas birthday and i happily see him and grandma to wish him happy birthday. Im okey spending an hour or so with family, but when it gets to 5..6..7 hours of keeping up i cant stand it. The fake smile hurts my jaw and gives a throbbing headeache which is probably when the anxiety is taking over. Not knowing what to say, fake laughing at their jokes, listening to their gossip, pretending im feeling fine and like i want to be there is awful. And then knowing my dad and his girlfriend is taking me to their house afterwards so i can stay over extends that even more. Its not like moms house, there i feel fine, comfortable in my bubble. Going to dads house is like im ”going to see dad” i feel like i have to constantly show face and be present and keep a conversation up and going and be entertaining 24/7. I cant help but feel like this is my last day of peace until i have to spend a full day with those people, potentially even longer because im taken to dads house. When i know times like this are coming up i spend every day feeling moody, stressed out, sensitive and close to tears because i know how emotionally draining it is and how badly i want it over with before its even started. When holidays are over i usually go in my room and cry, with thoughts of how weird, lonely, misunderstood and drained i feel. I hate to see people take it personal, i see how it looks that way when i never visit my dad for example, but its really not. I have nothing against anybody its just so emotionally draining and i have always felt like an outsider like the black sheep in my family, it gives me anxiety like the last thing i want is to be in that moment. Im sure somebody can relate to this. What can i do in situations like this, when all i really want is to escape the scene i cant just do that without looking like an asshole. I cant just leave and escape the scene but i feel dumb sitting there completely silent with a throbbing headache close to tears with a big fake smile on my face. I dont know which is worse to not show up, to deal with it for an hour just to show face and then slowly get away from the scene to sit in another room..alone, or to feel like an idiot, silent with crippling anxiety at the dinner table where it all happens but look somewhat polite and normal for blending in?

Tips to have closure in my mind for an issue that's already solved?,"I know it will get better over time, I'm only unsure about the short-term strategy of managing it. I worry that shifting my attention from the subject will hinder me in properly processing it and dealing with it.

In my case, it's about a guy who I kinda like but he loves me which caused me some pretty rough anxiety in the past week because I don't feel that much romantically towards him and didn't know how to proceed. I finally offered him to stay just friends but he said he feels too strongly about me and can't do it, so we parted ways peacefully (which I still feel kinda guilty about).

Like I said, I know I will be better soon, but I don't think it's beneficial for my mental health to just try to occupy my thoughts with other things/people. Or is it? Does it help me to heal faster if I just try to forget about him as soon as possible? We were also in a squad playing together, so now that the wounds are still fresh, it's awkward for me to talk to those who know both of us. (And I also started to worry a bit that I'm gonna react with extreme anxiety every time a guy gets close enough to me that he could be my potential boyfriend, but that's another topic. 🤦🏻)",EverblackPlasma,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n72j8p/tips_to_have_closure_in_my_mind_for_an_issue/

Just turned in my two weeks notice. My boss is being short with me. Just need someone to remind me that I'm not responsible for her feelings.,"Hey all. I've had generalized anxiety my whole life and big feels are just a part of my everyday routine. I've been job searching over the last few weeks because, while I love my current job, I don't feel that it provides me with security. 

Here's the scoop:

Even though I started out as a contract worker, my boss told me she would put me on salary by August of 2020. (That was one reason I accepted the position.) When that didn't happen, she told me it would be by January 2021. When that didn't happen, she told me we needed to wait on a few more clients to sign before she could do that. Don't get me wrong... she's tried to do right by me. She gave me a raise, an insurance stipend, and vaca pay. I truly think she's generous and is doing the best she can. But then.... a few weeks ago my paycheck bounced. (She sent me the money via Venmo, but let's face it... that's a red flag.) A couple weeks after that, she told me that she wouldn't be able to pay me the same time every month anymore because she needed to make sure the clients paid before she paid our team. Again, I get it. The world has been crazy. A global pandemic hasn't helped. Businesses go through these periods. However, I need security. I'm the only person left in my biological family. I need to make sure that I'm going to be okay. 

So, I started applying for jobs. I got an offer at a respectable company. They are starting me out at $11,000/year more than I'm currently making. It just makes sense. Today, I told my boss. I also told her that I'd still be available to help her out part time if necessary, and that this isn't personal... it's just what I need to do to make sure I'm taken care of. She responded with a very short email, told me that this is very unexpected and that we would talk on Monday.

Cue my anxiety. My people-pleasing mind hates that she feels this way. My codependent nature wants to hold her hand through this. But when I look at it from a logical perspective, I understand that I have nothing to feel bad about. I did what I needed to do. I gave her as much notice as I possibly could. I still offered to work with her and help her through the transition. I don't know what else I could have done differently, aside from not accepting this new, amazing, perfect-for-me job.

"How do you ""push through"" and get things done when anxiety gives you physical symptoms?","Since I was young, my anxiety will give me very bad headaches (sometimes to the point of migraine), extreme fatigue, tense muscles and jaw. I then feel like I have to stop working and manage these symptoms - rest, get off of the computer, try a shower, stretch etc. But this takes away from my work and I get freaked out that I'm committing ""time theft"" or just not getting work done at a rate I should, and then I get the symptoms again. I feel like I've had a headache nearly every day for weeks, because of the end of term. I've called in sick so many times, and I'm so embarrassed about it because it's just anxiety. My parents tell me to ""just push through and get it done"" because the things giving me anxiety will go away once I complete them (homework, assignments, etc).

22 years old and keep quitting jobs,"I am 22 years old. I have been working since I was 16 and never been unemployed for a long period of time. The longest I've stayed at a job was just a few months over a year.

I have had a few jobs now - I quit all of them except 1 where I was let go. I just get so up in my head with anxiety that I end up feeling miserable and needing to quit. Spend all the time out of the job crying and on the verge of tears the whole working day - feeling sick to my stomach.

I've never known what I wanted to do for a living, I just wanted enough money to pay for the things I enjoy like gaming and my pets. Every job has given me this yet I still become increasingly unhappy that now I think I'm just not cut out for the working world but unfortunately I'm not rich or famous so I have no choice.

The jobs make me anxious when I don't know what's going to happen or I don't know what I'm doing so everytime I start a new job I get anxious about learning it - it's a cruel cycle.

I started taking valerian root pills, 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening. Kinda calms me. Everything seems to be work related. I can find the correct focus to do things, not even the courage, sometimes, like if i would ask someone something, they would say ""NO WAY, F YOU"". But in reality they wont, it's just in my head.

Feeling Low: Chest Pain,"Really feeling down and of course anxious. Was having a wonderful time with my niece and her friend. We were at the mall and all of a sudden, I started having really sharp chest pains. One after another. So my anxiety of course kicks in and I’m thinking about telling them I need an ambulance. We finally get out of the mall and the pain is gone. I think alright, let’s grab lunch and head home. Of course half way through the lunch the pain comes back even worse. Like stabbing and pressure in my chest. Of course I rush them through lunch, and this is one of the last times I’m going to see my niece for a while because we live in another state. Rush home and drop her off. So defeated. But at the same time I’m just worried I’m having a heart attack. I hate this so much. I’ve been to two cardiologists wore a halter monitor, stress tests, multiple ekg’s—and the only thing one cardiologist told me was I have an extra beat less than one percent of all beats which is not uncommon. Now all this constant stress has given me periods of really high blood pressure. 

So I ruined my time with my niece. Im making myself physically ill. I’m sitting here debating going to a hospital for them to once again say I’m fine. I’m now worried that at a family dinner tonight I’ll either drop dead or spiral into a panic attack. I feel helpless. 

Has anyone ever just consistently had stabbing pains or palpitations and they just never turn out to be anything serious? How do you manage these events after countless docs say you’re fine? I don’t want to give up but this feels hopeless. Any and all advice is appreciated.",botchjob69,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n753n4/feeling_low_chest_pain/

COVID anxiety spiralling...,"My anxiety about getting the virus is really really bad and effects my daily life (takes me hours sometimes to muster the strength to leave the house for groceries etc). 

My partner and I both were fortunate enough to get one dose of vaccine but where I live the virus is extremely out of control and we are not fully protected so I’m still scared. My partner has to go to work and his main coworker hasn’t been vaccinated yet. He could go, but he is taking his sweet time booking the appointment.

Tired of anxiety and how it has isolated me,"This is a mild rant. I have had anxiety my whole life but it has always been manageable until recently. About a three years ago I was in a terrible relationship that was emotionally and physically abusive. He made me a ball of depression and anxiety. He destroyed my friendships and tried separating me from my parents the best that he could. I tell myself alot that what I went through wasn't terrible and that it shouldn't of affected me like this. It was a short relationship and I didn't end up dead like some women do in these situations. I also blame myself a lot still for what I went through. 

Its been so long since then and to be honest I didn't get the help that I should have. It felt like every relationship I had was now destroyed and my anxiety told me I would only be a bother if I tried being friends with them again. I was a terrible friend when I was with him and I couldn't get myself to even try to face them to apologize. There is a lot of shame there and fear or rejection. I wanted to try so bad but now I feel like it is to late. 

I am finally getting back on track mentally. I am feeling a lot better. I want to try and make friends again. I am lonely. I do have a new boyfriend who is wonderful and supportive. I love hanging out with him but I miss having friends like I used to. I feel like I rely on him too much you know? But everytime I want to try my anxiety shuts me down. It's frustrating. I used to be able to talk to anyone with no problem really. Now though I consistently feel the guilt of being a bad friend in the past and the worry of rejection. I do try somewhat online but it feels like I am annoying them. 

I miss how I used to be. I miss being confident and social. I miss having my friends. I want to get back to that. I know these things take time but it is not coming soon enough for me. I want to be myself again. Sometimes I don't even recognize myself. Its like I am a different person, a scared person. I hate how lonely it has made me become.

Anyone late 30s and an anxiety sufferer?,"I’m a 38 year old mum of 3. I’ve been anxious my whole life and this led to depression in my teens which means I’ve been on and off medication since then. I can’t remember a time I haven’t felt this way, but I accept that unfortunately this is who I am.

What I am struggling with as I get older is how much I’ve missed out on, the things I’ve failed at because being so anxious made me give up or not even try, and it feels like as I age this list becomes more apparent. Eg I dropped out of college (uk) because my parents kept telling me it was a waste of time and they needed rent off me, so then it was just a stream of useless dead end jobs. I’ve got no career and I know at this age my chances are few. 

I attempted getting my cbt a couple of years ago, I can still recall the sweating and panic and racing heart etc I had to give up and leave. My friend has just aced hers today and loved it. It’s just a reminder of yet another thing I’ve failed at and I feel ridiculous for thinking this way. 

I can drive but I don’t because I worry about any potential problems, parking etc. I’ve got no friends - I’m not exaggerating - I just have my husband. I’m alone all the time, I walk a lot.

I don’t know what I expect from posting, I just feel so lonely and useless. My parents neglected me terribly as a child and I hate that I’m like this as a result, too scared to do anything.

Inspirational Poem (05/07/21),"# The Wind, One Brilliant Day

*by Antonio Machado*

The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.

""In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.""

""I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.""

""Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.""

The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself: ""What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?""

Dreading another night of no sleep,"I have GAD and a huge anxiety trigger for me is sleep. Last night I slept for 2 hours and then woke up off and on for the rest of the night. I think I'm adjusting to my new dosage of Zoloft but I'm having such a fucking hard time. I should be exhausted from my shitty night, but I feel like I drank too much caffeine and am losing my shit. I can't muster myself up to take my dog out or exercise, though I know it would be helpful and would probably burn off some of my energy. I know I'll probably have another bad night of sleep and anxiety attacks tonight and it's really traumatic for both me and my partner when this happens. I'm just so frustrated because since starting medication 6.5 weeks ago it's been a rollercoaster, but last week I thought I'd finally found the right dose and felt great. It was so amazing to just feel calm, with little to no anxiety, great decision-making skills, and feel like my ""old self"" before my disorder started. I've felt my anxiety slowly ramping up over the past several days and today it's terrible. I can't focus on anything. It takes so much mental work to just get up, brush my hair, shower, and get dressed. Thankfully I'm off work until Tuesday, because idek how I'd work in this state.

I just feel like my whole life is a shitshow and every time I get a little relief from my anxiety it disappears as soon as I feel like I'm starting to heal. I have all this free time and it would be great to be able to get things done, but all I can do is think about how fucking anxious I am.

"I hate any kind of job, the thought about working makes me so anxious. I'm created to be in peace, not in stress because I have a hard time coping with it","I'm 23 F and I have worked in 10 places already. In restaurants, stores, big manufacturing companies, small family ones too.

 I hated every day working in each place. 

Just a thought about waking up every day at 6, doing ""important"" stuff on bosse's command, dealing and cooperating with coworkers makes me sick. 
I'm an engineer already and doing my Master's right now. I don't mind studying at University, I don't love it, I don't despise it, I'd rather study than work.

I know after graduation I will be forced to go to the worked by life. I need money to live. 

But every thought about working anywhere makes my body, mind and soul sick. After panicking I have to lay down under the blanket for a few hours, watch tv series and brainwash myself out of the negative thoughts by bombing my brain with TV or Internet crap.

The only things that make me happy are dancing, doing sports, painting, cooking, taking care of my house or garden, hanging out with family and friends, slowly going through life. I want to be stay at home mome one day, have a lot of kids and the care of my family. Just imagine a typical wife in 1950s that is a nurturing stay at home mother taking care of her house while her husband provides for a family. That's the life I'm made for, not the work environment. 

When I'm in any type of rush my adrenaline spikes and anxiety hits. I need to slow everything down to feel in peace. Any type of rush just destroys me. That's one of the reasons why working makes my body sick. I don't tolerate any types of stress.

Don't know what to do. Maybe there are people like me that despise working and they have found a solution for that?",Brief-Fruit6664,117,64,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n69d9u/i_hate_any_kind_of_job_the_thought_about_working/
Anxiety over living in a simulation,"I know this sounds so crazy and I never thought I’d ever say this but my anxiety has gotten so bad to the point where I feel like i’m not real and i’m a simulation. For example I thought to myself I should probably look into getting a dentist because I haven’t been in so long, the first ad I see of the day on Facebook is for a local dentist and I didn’t google it or say it out loud. I’ve never seen a dentist ad like that on fb. This has been happening so much where I will think something and an ad pops up. Also today I wanted an ice cream bar really bad and so my fiance took me to the store to get one. When I went inside they have everything you could think of, frozen pizza, frozen meals, juice, sodas. Then I look over at the bare ice cream section ‘No ice cream due to freezer malfunction’. This is the third time something like this happened to me this week. I will want something and because I want it, the universe makes it out of stock. I know I sound crazy but i’m feeling so weird inside like something bad is going to happen and I’m about to go crazy. :( whenever i’m having a good day I get rear ended in my car or close to it. I know it’s just a sequence of small coincidences in a row but it’s driving me crazy. I feel scared and this feeling of impending doom like everything is out to get me.

I keep having embarrassing public outbursts and feel like I need to move," I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life, and I'm pretty sure I have at least mild BPD because I just cannot seem to control my emotions when I get upset. I am 34 and this has been going on most of my life; I have sought treatment more times than I can remember and am on three different meds to manage my anxiety and depression.  


But I still get into these situations where I'm incredibly stressed and frustrated, and I end up completely losing it in public - usually on the street/sidewalk, but sometimes I have ""freakouts"" in stores, restaurants, etc. Most of the time I just scream at the top of my lungs and hit myself in the face repeatedly while saying crazy things - basically just an adult temper tantrum. I suppose it must feel cathartic in the moment, but it's extremely embarrassing afterward. I have a running list now of places (stores, restaurants, etc) I can no longer go because I had an adult temper tantrum in public and am too ashamed to go back.  


Even worse, this keeps happening at home in my apartment complex - just this morning, I slept through my alarm and was running super late to work, so I screamed and hit myself in the face right outside my building at around 7 in the morning. Just the other day, my smoke detector wouldn't stop beeping, and I didn't know how to turn it off, so I started screaming at the top of my lungs ""STOP!! STOP!! STOP!!"" (also very early in the morning) - eventually I just had to take out the batteries and snip the wires - now I'm too embarrassed to even put in a work order to fix/replace it. And I'm sure all my neighbors know who I am by now - ""that crazy guy with the dog who's always yelling."" I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to show my face around my apartment and have to look down at all times to avoid eye contact or interaction with anyone, since they might recognize me as the crazy guy and get into a confrontation.

Chest Pains,"Hello everyone,
Last year around October/November I had a big day recreationally using cocaine and ended up calling an ambulance thinking I was having a heart attack. 
Once in hospital they didn't give me much information but my bloods came back ok, chest Xray ok and they monitored me for around 5hrs and I was fine. 

That was enough to scare me and I haven't touched anything besides alcohol (rarely drink just socially) I even quit smoking. 

Since then I've been having chest pains on and off. Most days. As well as a heaviness in my right arm and a pain in my right leg that's sort of feels like an electric shock. ( lasts no more than 1 second)

I could be at work and happily doing a task im confident in when it hits me or I could be at home sitting on the couch watching TV when the pains occur. 

After multiple visits with my GP (I told him everything) he sent me to get an echocardiogram and that came back ok. I've also had an ultrasound and besides a slightly fatty liver (which he said isn't to worry about at the moment) everything is ok.
My blood pressure is a little elevated 130/82 at the doctors. However I monitor myself at home and usually under normal numbers.
He ended up prescribing me Mertazapine thinking I have anxiety (which I may have but im not convinced). 
I even went and saw a psychiatrist once but didn't feel like I was getting anything im generally a pretty positive and happy person, a problem solver and I feel happy. 

I was on mertazapine for at least 3 months and been to the ER 2 times with chest pains in that time. Once on my own while having chest pains at work and once by doctors orders after my description on my chest pains and family history worried him
Both times chest xrays and bloods came back ok.

While on mertazapine my pains never stopped and I was sleeping way too much, personality completely changed and gained so much weight probably at least 20kg. It honestly was not making me happy. 
I was late to work almost every day because I couldn't get enough sleep. 

I've stopped using it since I decided it wasn't for me. My GP told me to slowly dose off but I did it pretty quickly as I hated the person it made me. I've been off for around 3 weeks. 

My sharp leg pain is the one that mostly bothers me. It feels to me like a blocked artery but im no doctor. The chest pain and arm is mostly pretty dull but noticeable and it does worry me. 

Im just wondering if anyone else has been under any similar situation. Should I be pushing my doctor more towards something is wrong with my arteries/heart since my chest pain and leg pain hasn't stopped or should I be looking for a new anxiety medication?

Is there another test or something I can ask my doctor to do as the pain in my leg honestly feels to me like something is blocked up.

The mertazapine made me so unfit and has probably caused anxiety with the weight gain if anything. Weight is something I used to struggle with when I was younger and took me 10 years to loose the weight. I've gained the weight that took me 10 years to loose and keep off in a short time frame.

Anybody with any advice would be great.
Im honestly unsure if its just anxiety or if I may have a medical condition.

I’ve had the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had in my life and it’s been a cluster of them lately. I feel bad about leaving work because I feel they really don’t understand that I cannot control how my brain is firing.

What are my options?,"So I've recently come to terms with the idea that I most likely have anxiety. For years I've been frequently cold and shaky despite it actually being warm, and I never really feel comfortable - not when I sleep, not in the shower, not in my bedroom, not even on the toilet. It's the same in social situations as it is when I'm in my house. It's increased particularly due to a couple events recently where I have been threatened and physically assaulted by the same group twice.

I very much want help with this. In-person help very much ideally. I went to my GP early last year because I felt anxious, and I described to him how I was suicidal, how I've attempted before, how I always feel anxious, how I spent 20% of my time away from school in Year 11 because I didn't feel confident enough to go in. He told me to write down my feelings and burn the paper after, and sent me a text to a charity called OTR. Here's the issue - the former solution helps in the short-term but doesn't actually stop my anxiety, and the latter solution has a wait list up to, and maybe surpassing, a year.

I can talk to my parents, I can talk to my girlfriend, but neither are completely helpful. I'll be honest, I've not given my parents much of a chance to help - they don't even know I've felt suicidal in the past. I guess I'm worried of disappointing them or worrying them since all of my siblings bar one has had the same issues and I hate to see my mum worry. My girlfriend, whilst she might try her best, isn't great at comforting. I've tried to help teach her how to comfort me but it's going to be a long process.

I am in college, and so I'm sure I could get counseling there, but I'm in college 3 times a fortnight. I'm not 18 so I don't even qualify for therapy provided by the NHS. 

I really do need help. I don't want to keep feeling like this, nor do I want it to ever get worse again. I just don't know what my options are. I've tried dietary changes, I've tried cutting caffeine (I was off caffeine for 4 months over a year back after years of drinking &gt;10 cups of coffee a day most days, not even soft drinks, and it had no effect), I've tried exercise.

Propranolol really has done the job for me. I laughed hard at something funny on the TV for the first time in years.,"Personal experience YMMV

I swapped from citalopram to propanolol and prochlorperazine (for dizzyness and nausea) a few months back on doctors advice because Citalopram (SSRI) had taken all the emotion out of my life (sex, imagination, laughter, crying) even though it worked on my anxiety and depression very well. 

After switching my anxiety get really bad, crawling the walls bad and having panic attacks like you wouldn’t believe and the deepest darkest depression I’ve ever experienced - thinking about death almost non-stop, mine and others. Lockdown (UK) wasn’t helping either. But now, a few months later having taken it every morning and night I really feel like the joy of life has returned. We had a lockdown garden meet-up with friends (2 bubbles, six people) and I couldn’t stop talking and laughing the whole time. Background anxiety is still there and I do feel a bit woozy for the first minutes from waking up but otherwise it’s side effect free. Long may this continue.",itsaride,7,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6ocmf/propranolol_really_has_done_the_job_for_me_i/
"How To Recover After ""Traumatising"" Event While Waiting For Meds?","I've come a long way in understanding my anxiety, mainly because of meditation and countless self-help books and videos. I've always been prone to anxiety, but this current episode has been worse than anything before and has lasted over 6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I set myself a deadline: since much of my anxiety has stemmed from stomach problems and I dreaded my upcoming colonoscopy, I decided to only try meds if my mood doesn't get better after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though my colonoscopy went fine and nothing truly traumatising happened, it was my first experience with hospitals and I felt so,  so awful during it. I spent 24h sitting on toilet floor, panicking. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel like my ""inner child"" is still crying after it. It's been three days and my anxiety is horrible. Small things cause lots of distress, sofa is my only safe place and going outside horrifies me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed with GAD, and I think I have tendency to emetophobia, agoraphobia and hypochondria. I have a prescription for escitalopram. Since starting SSRI can cause nasty side effects, I plan to start it after the next week, since my school will be over then and I have no responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I could do to get over this experience, to feel more normal again? Anything to ease the situation before I can try medication? (and I know, it will take few weeks before even that will help, if it will at all. I am pretty confident it will though. )",Zeraharr,1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6z0dy/how_to_recover_after_traumatising_event_while/

Citalopram/ SSRIs,"I went to see a new psychiatrist yesterday for an evaluation and she prescribed me trazadone for sleep and citalopram for anxiety. I have taken SSRIs before and I don’t care for them. They wreck my sex drive and when I do have a sex drive, I cannot orgasm. My anxiety is bad at night and I have been through years of therapy to be able to cope with panic attacks etc. I haven’t had a panic attack in 6 months and given the state of our world I think that’s pretty damn good. I’m definitely not depressed. I’m not suicidal, and I’m not self harming. It seems extreme to me to be put on an SSRI when in all honesty, I feel like I’m handling my anxiety well. My blood pressure is low, my weight is healthy, I’m not having panic attacks. My biggest issue is sleep, but the trazadone should help with that. I plan on calling her back today and asking to not take the ssri, but I’m afraid that will label me somehow as being unwilling to be treated. I just really don’t want to take medications. The whole reason I did the evaluation is for a diagnosis so I can learn some more diagnosis-specific coping strategies for whatever is wrong with my noggin. Do you have experience with SSRIs and anxiety? I have read several studies showing that people with chronic anxiety often have *higher* levels of serotonin rather than lower?",joeharrissnail,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6y9p2/citalopram_ssris/

Babies, houses, moving across the county but I’m just “happy” where I’m at right now because I know I’ll never get this time back.

.25mg/day for three week of Klonopin.,"Hi everyone! I was recently prescribed a dosage of .25mg/day of klonopin for three weeks. and before I take it, I have been really wanting some information on whether or not I will have withdrawal symptoms after the three weeks? I don’t want to put myself in a bad situation considering I already have pretty bad anxiety. Anyone who has any insight or experience on this, would be very helpful cuz I don’t plan to fill my prescription after this three weeks.

Constant anxiety over my brother’s future is wearing me down.,"My older brother is a good person, and I know that. He’s never gotten in trouble at school, he’s been praised at work, he’s respectful, he’s friendly, etc. However, he struggles in school a lot, especially with the pandemic. This is driving me nuts. It seems like all I can think about these days are “is he going to be successful” “is he going to be homeless in the future” “will he be able to get a professional career”. In the past week, I’ve lashed out twice at my brother and my mom in moments of panic. Of course I’ve apologized afterwards and felt immense regret, but that doesn’t change the fact that I feel like I’m becoming a menace to my own family.

The worst part is that I’m worried about the future. Something I can’t control. I tried reading stories about people who struggled in school but were still able to go somewhere in life, but that only calms my nerves for a little bit before I go back to constantly worrying. It seems to be the only thing on my mind these days and I’m tired of it. I stay up late at night to tire myself out so I don’t fall asleep thinking of the future. I feel like they’re is a constant weight on my chest and I want it to just go away so I can breathe and relax. But I can’t. And it’s scary. I don’t want to live the rest of my teenage life like this.

It also doesn’t help that I don’t do much nowadays, so I have so much time to just think. And I really want to just stop thinking. 

All I’m asking for is some advice on what I should do and how I should make myself feel better. I hate the thought of spending my time like this.",yeehawyeetus,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6xs8g/constant_anxiety_over_my_brothers_future_is/

Should I get help?,"I’m nervous whether or not to go see someone about my anxiety, I think it has slowly gotten worse and worse but  I don’t want to be one of those people that ‘self-diagnoses’ and wastes peoples time.

Since I started Uni I think my anxiety has doubled down, I have no friends cause I’m too scared to talk to anyone, I skip seminars cause the fear of going in overwhelms me and in lectures I’ll purposely find the most isolated spot in the room to sit so I both don’t have to talk to anyone and won’t get asked questions. I keep having these horrible feelings of dread and overwhelming fear that feels like it comes from a core part of me, I’ll travel to uni on the train, walk to the uni building and stand outside in an isolated spot struggling to catch my breath and having those feelings until I eventually just walk away and wander around until the next train gets back so I can leave, and then I’ll lie to people saying I actually went in.

I’ve also finally recently got my first job after applying for ages and on my first shift I found myself in the bathroom like 6 times having those same feelings of dread and overwhelming fear, pacing back and forth breathing heavily. I stand there awkwardly while everyone around me talks to each other and I’m too scared to join in incase I mess up or say the wrong thing.

I don’t know if those feelings of dread and shortness of breath are panic attacks but I’m hesitant to label them that. But I think it’s really starting to affect my life as I’m struggling in uni and I’ve had to quit my first ever job cause I’m too scared to go back. 

Should I go to the doctors and ask about it or am I just overreacting to things that everyone has? Are there any reliable tests I can do see if I need to get further help? Any help is appreciated.",Jack-Frost09876,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6xqat/should_i_get_help/

Trigger Warning: Childhood abuse. Is anyone else intensely afraid of the dark?,"Does anyone else have a crippling fear of the dark/night's alone?

I usually have to keep the lights on and even then my mind never truly relaxes and I basically just stay awake in fear until I pass out from exhaustion. 
During these nights, I am scared of real life things like someone breaking in while I'm alone and also not so real things like ghosts and memorable characters from horror movies that I've watched in the past.

Letting it all out,"I have this feeling of impending doom / death anxiety &amp; like I’ll have a certain time in mind and it just freaks me out and I start getting deja vu and it feels like the impending doom / derealization put together and I dont know how to make it stop because there’s nothing I can really do it just comes randomly. Tomorrow is my birthday and I can’t get the thought out of my head that I’m gonna die at 12:00 and this probably all sounds stupid but I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore and I’m getting chest pains and my legs &amp; feet just start cramping. This and more of my anxiety has literally taken over my life. I don’t tell anyone because I’m scared three will invalidate me or that my problems aren’t as bad as other peoples so they’ll think I’m looking for attention. I don’t know how to feel at this point. Today I woke up feeling really shitty, in the afternoon I started getting intrusive and suicidal thoughts but I didn’t do anything (I usually self harm or do something irrational when I’m angry), then I felt productive and got my room clean &amp; now my anxiety feels like it’s about to skyrocket. I felt like my sugar was high (diabetic) and I felt shitty so I took way too much insulin and I’m probably gonna be fucked up later tonight &amp; everything is freaking me out but it’s like I’m numb to it by now. I’m used to the feeling of this and I’m honestly sick of it. I just want to live my life without overthinking, over analyzing, anxiety, derealization, intrusive thoughts, health problems &amp; and everything else. I used to be a very spiritual person so some of my anxiety comes from that or religious ocd because as a kid I was a jehovas witness and I’m seeing a lot of Christians around me. So everything’s just really confusing and I’m scared to make the wrong choice if yk what I mean. I started to overanalyze when I started thinking that every thought in my head was being judged by god or that my thoughts weren’t mine and it was someone communicating to me. Ik it sounds insane but I just don’t wanna have this in the back of my head 24/7. I’m self conscious of myself and I get really paranoid in public (the impending doom thing) and the more I try to fight it the more it consumes me and I’m in complete fear and my thoughts just take over. I don’t know if I know who I am anymore. Everything’s just changing. It’s the worst at night and the pains only add more insult to injury. My breath starts thinning and I start getting scared of my heart stopping or a heart attack or if I’ll just stop breathing. It’s always the worse case scenario for me and it’s getting really tough to handle it on my own. I told my mom about it and she tried to comfort me but I can’t rely on her every time. Plus it’s kind of embarrassing for me to ask for help, I’ve had that problem since I was in elementary school. When I start spiraling I don’t feel like I’m in the real world all I can think about is tragedy and death and it really really fucks with my head because it carries over into the day. I noticed I’m getting more violent and I have more violent thoughts. I feel disconnected from everything. My family, my friends, the world. I lost all motivation and interest in most things I used to love like gaming, basketball, working out. I‘be been pretty much heavily addicted to porn this past year more than normal. It’s slowly sucking the life out of me but somehow I still want more. Like I’m not learning my lesson. It’s forcing me to go to fetishes I probably shouldn’t even know about and it’s robbing me of my innocence. I’m constantly wasting my life and energy on it and it feels like I’ll always be trapped. Like the devil has some hold on me or something and I can t get out of a prison. NF’s Music helped me with the suicidal thoughts and self hatred / harm I was feeling but the problem is still here. For some reason I have this bad habit of running away from the problem or ignoring it or acting like it never existed in the first place but I can’t run forever. This is probably one of my more dumber thoughts but I had this dream where someone broke into my house through my window and I’m getting the impending doom feeling and it’s probably nothing but I just can’t let the thought go. I also can’t forget a dream where my sister shot me and all of this is just kinda freaking me out &amp; I just wanna stop. I haven’t been getting a lot of physical activity and that’s just me being lazy and depressed but it’s taking a toll on my body. I also have a literal chronic disease That’s why it’s so hard to differentiate between health and anxiety if the symptoms are even anxiety. I just don’t feel... safe? Everything feels off and I don’t feel good. I just feel wrong about doing everything. I start getting this feeling that I’m in a simulation and nothing and nobody around me feels real. That’s probably why I feel detached. It really sucks especially when I have low blood sugars because I start to get lightheaded and I start sweating and the pain gets worse then I start getting anxiety after that then it all just manifests into me being burnt out and just done with everything the next day. The reality I’ve come to terms with is that nobodies here for me but my family. But I’m still too scared to tell them anything about my predicament and Like I said I don’t like asking for help so I keep it all in. I’m not even diagnosed so I don’t wanna make a big deal about anything. One of my biggest fears is dying and being forgotten about. I feel so lonely and I don’t want to feel like this for the rest of my life. I just feel like through all of this my innocence my childhood and my happiness just got snatched up. I don’t even remember being a happy kid. It’s like my whole world is just getting foggy and I’m slowly disconnecting.

"I need a hug, also to vent.","I was talking to my parents about how I wanted to eat, (my second meal of the day at midnight) but I knew we were both going to be disappointed in me if I did. Because it’s unhealthy to eat that late and unregulated.

Of course it started a big argument where my mother defend herself, and my father stayed silent except to remind me to be respectful.

I tried talking about how it’s hard for me with my depression and anxiety, (undiagnosed and unmedicated because money,) to wake up at noon and only get the motivation to eat at dinner time. And then to have my desire to eat shot down by my parents because it’s unhealthy. (Really? I didn’t know!) [Edit to clarify: my dad says that eating once a day is fine because I’m getting enough calories and I have enough fat reserves that it can be considered intermittent fasting.]

So then my mom rebutted me and said all of it is my choice. I choose to let my struggles rule my life. (I barely have the motivation to do anything.) Apparently it’s all a choice that I wake up and make every day. And I need to grow up and get a job because I’m now an adult. (I would like to be stable enough to do that!)

Anyway, it all ended with my mom telling me that she never wanted to start an argument over food. And to, “shut up.” (I can hear my mom ranting to my dad about me. And now she’s laughing, probably about how unreasonable I am.) Probably the worst part is that in a few minutes she’s going to come in my room and act all apologetic for yelling. But that’s all she’ll apologize for, if she does at all. [Edit: It’s been almost twenty minutes, she isn’t going to. I can’t decide if that’s worse.]
And my father will ignore the problem and take her side like a good husband.

So, now I’m in my room crying and complaining to the internet anonymously because I can’t talk to anyone about this. And I guess I’m also doing this to block out my intrusive thoughts about h@rm that get hard to ignore when I’m breaking down. 

It will probably be “fine” by tomorrow anyway. But thanks for reading if you got this far. ❤️",that-other-one------,2,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6t67p/i_need_a_hug_also_to_vent/

Should I go a therapist?,"Hi, I figured that this subreddit would be the most helpful in finding out my symptoms, thank you to everyone in advance. 

I'm what everyone around me would consider as someone least likely to have anxiety. I'm confident, not afraid to speak up, and overall what they'd describe as ""chill."" I'd I'd say myself that i only sometimes get worried.

But when I do get worried, I would worry to the max.

I start shivering, feeling nauseous or lightheaded or throwing up, cry uncontrollably even when there's really nothing to cry about, feeling like I'm always on the go, m hands start shaking, and my mind start running with different thoughts. I'd even go on panic attacks which will last for hours at my worst. I'd even think think I might die or put myself at risk when I had my worst panic attack. 

I am so confused and am so frustrated with whats happening to me. I've seen people with anxiety before and it look like it just happens without a trigger (I'm sorry if i get this wrong I'm a stranger to anxiety disorders), but I'd always feel this without a fail whenever I get just a little bit worried, which is why I always try to be chill about matters so I won't start having a panic attack out of nowhere. 

I don't like to self diagnose but when someone suggested that I might have anxiety, I initially thought they were just being silly, but then the more I look into it the more the description actually sounds like me. I'd shake uncontrollably even when I'm just overhyped about something and one time I had to go the nurses office because i literally couldn't concentrate since I'm shaking sm.

Even one of my comments on a page got 3 downvotes even though the information I provided was correct and I provided my sources and idk it’s triggering me so much. 

The other day someone told me I “need to use commas” on my post instead of periods and I was triggered. I looked through his posts and saw multiple occasions where he used commas INCORRECTLY and it was so hard to not comment on those posts about it. I’m kind of a grammar nerd at heart so this is probably why it triggered me. I’ll admit my grammar isn’t perfect and I do get lazy with punctuation online. But that (now deleted) post he replied to was fine without commas. I’m now just realizing this happened like 3 weeks ago and I’m still thinking about it. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN BY OBSESSING! (I have other occasions where this has happened but I won’t bore you with them all.)

This also can happen if I say something I feel like sounded stupid I won’t stop thinking about what I said. But the majority of the time it’s not what I’ve said and what people say to me. 

I didn’t used to be like this, and I don’t know how to handle it. 

My therapist said to snap myself with a rubber band whenever it happens. Well, I’m not comfortable with inflicting pain on myself to stop thinking about negative things. 

I tell myself that it doesn’t matter what other people think and to just get over it, but it doesn’t work. 

Please no judgement. Since I’ve come off medication due to excessive side effects it’s really hard for me not to be triggered then obsess over things. I don’t know if this is necessarily my ocd or my anxiety (I am diagnosed with both) but I don’t know where else to post where I won’t get attacked because I’m sure r/advice would have a field day and I’d get so much negativity and people would telling me to stop being such a “snowflake”.

I’d also like to include I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2 and am on medication for bipolar. My bipolar meds haven’t been helping with this but when I was on SSRI’s because I was misdiagnosed with depression, they helped with this, but I got too many side effects from them and couldn’t function so I had to stop. 

Sorry this post got so long.

Do you have any suggestions? Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: How do I stop being triggered when people say things that bother me?

Weird little things that only get to you sometimes?,"Possible triggers. 




Does anyone else have weird little things that only bother you sometimes but most of the time otherwise they're nothing?

Example 97% of my life it's nothing. Doesn't even register most of the time.

But every once in a while the space between my big toes and my other toes bothers me.

Like my toes feel too close and I HATE it. So then I wiggle them back and forth and obviously they come even closer together when I do that which makes it worse. And god forbid if they brush or touch at all.

And the more I think about it the worse I get. Full on butterflies in my stomach, fidgeting, cant sit still or not think about it because I get just so bothered and uncomfortable. From my toes.

Have you ever forced a yawn because it felt like you couldn't breathe (and have you ever fixed the feeling)?,"Hi Reddit. This is my 1st post and I just made an account because I've had enough....

Since I was about 8-9 years old, I can recall going thru periods where my chest feels tight, like I'm sitting at the bottom of a pool, all day. The ONLY thing that makes it go away is a deep, forced, sigh or yawn. Sometimes it lasts for a week, sometimes it lasts several months. There are no related triggers and it is not a panic attack. There is nothing wrong with my lungs (I've seen 2 pulmonologists). I've seen a speech pathologist; she gave me breathing that didn't help. I've been to therapy (including CBT), and while it helped me, it hasn't helped the BREATHING issue. After all these medical visits, NO ONE, not a single medical professional I've met with, knows what I'm talking about. The best I've gotten is sympathy, the worst was being dismissed and told that I'm making it up. 

I've met two people who described to me identical symptoms and I've read similar stories on the internet, which is how I know this is a symptom of anxiety. I've found blog posts from other frustrated people and there are even medical reviews on the condition if you search Google Scholar (its called 'sigh syndrome,' 'compulsive sighing,' or 'psychogenic dyspnea'). But most studies are kinda outdated, and at least two suggest ""reassuring the patient that they are fine"" as the ""treatment.""  I generally don't feel like I have anxiety, but its obvious that its connect in other so I am not ruling it out. 

It was the worst for me in college. I was very involved and very busy, so I believe it is related to stress. But again, its not acute.... It almost seems to work like a cold: if I am stressed for too long, I get 'run-down' and it sets in for a few weeks. I did track and field in college, ran 50+ miles per week, maintained a pretty normal sleep schedule and ate a pretty good diet. This is not going away with push-ups or vegetables (but if someone replies saying eating only kale forever fixes it......... I'd try it). 

After I graduated a few years ago, I took a pretty relaxed but unfulfilling job, and for those two years, the sighing stopped. I certainly went thru periods of relationship and COVID-induced stress, but the issue was gone. Except I recently returned to grad school and last week it started again. I'm not having it. I had a taste of freedom and I know I can't do this anymore. I forgot how AWFUL it is to sit thru meetings and go about life faking a normal, blank face while inside I feel like I'm literally drowning. I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for the 1st time, but the appointment is 2 months away and I'm worried it will go away by then, making it impossible to judge whether meds help. 

So my questions for you all: 

1. Anyone out there with a similar experience?
2. Has anyone met a medical professional that was familiar with this issue? 
3. Has anyone successfully solved the issue, with medication or otherwise? 

TL;DR 

I often suffer from a sensation that I am not breathing even though I am, which goes away if I yawn. I know the symptoms are related to anxiety. No doctor or therapist has ever known what I was talking about or been able to help, but I KNOW other people with this issue are out there feeling this way too. I'm wondering if anyone has cured the dang thing!!!!",hot-chai-tea-latte,3,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6pkur/have_you_ever_forced_a_yawn_because_it_felt_like/
Imposter syndrome makes my anxiety worse.,"And then the anxiety feeds my imposter syndrome and it keeps cycling and cycling. 

Today is a tough day and the evening now is where it has ‘hit’. Night is often worse right? 

I am the office dragon of three small businesses (HR, sales, web designer, ad designer, admin, bookings, warranty, shipping). It’s a lot to cram into one day every day. And I am not perfect at it. I’ve had to take two half days a week for my health this year because of chronic illness being impacted by burn out. Which helps my body but also helps me get behind. 

I feel hampered at every turn. If I drop a ball it’s hard to collect it again in time. Client expectations are the biggest challenge to manage. 

Today I am tired. I have a couple balls I am trying to regain on a fraying string. I was able to get my first shot of the vaccine booked and while I am excited I feel like I can’t celebrate it because I ‘don’t deserve it’ and people will question why I am getting it earlier than them. And that’s not right. But that’s how I FEEL.

Why do I sometimes feel like I’m melting?,"There’s this really weird reaction that happens to me sometimes, almost always early in the morning after a really confusing Dream.

I get so disoriented thinking about it that I get hit with strong anxiety, and this bizarre melty or liquidy sensation under my skin. The only way to describe it is how the top layer of hard candy dissolves in your mouth. 

It only lasts a minute or two, but it leaves me wandering about my apartment struggling to make my brain work, and it’s come on so quickly and so strong before that I threw up.

Somebody Shine Some Light,"Hello Everyone,

   I’m looking for another point of view on my situation. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. I’ll make it as short as I can. 
   
   I’m a 35 y/o male and I have Crohn’s Disease. I have it bad. I’ve had 3 bowel surgeries, I’ll have an ileostomy the rest of my life. I’ve had a fischer, I’ve had a large pocket of infection sliced open while I was awake, I’ve dealt with a year long battle with a stricture...this is where your bowels get blocked...I’ve had and healed 6 sub cutaneous fistulas (open holes on your belly that tunnel from your intestines and make an open hole on your belly) One surgery I was 6’1 and weighed 93 lbs (due to medical mismanagement) on and on and on. 
    
   I do not posses the vocabulary for the amount pain and sorrow I’ve been through. I’ve been on very high doses of Prednisone not for days or months...but years. Twice...I’ve been put on the strongest pain medicines know to man for years...and then gotten off of them. 
     
   The last two years I dealt with another stricture which yielded over 20 extremely traumatic messy ER visits. A full grown man screaming for mercy in pain. Nurses/Doctors running down hallways to push med in to get me out of pain. I ended up having a surgery a year ago to remove the stricture...it went well. 
    
   It was time to get off the pain meds three weeks later and day three, I crashed. The vomiting was so bad it split my incision. My PCP basically told me to go pound sand...he wouldn’t talk to me personally and trotted out some nurse to basically tell me day 3 was the worst and to suck it up. I went to the ER...they billed me as a drug seeker as well. They gave me no attention for 6 hours. I begged them for a CT scan. The radiologist saw the split. The doctor rushed into my room after 6 hours in agony...didn’t apologize and pushed a pain med finally. I forcefully demanded she contact my surgeon in a nearby big city. He found out what was going on and immediately had me taken by medcu to his hospital where they squared me away. He was pissed. 
   
   Fast forward a year later to present day. I have faithfully tapered off of Ketamine, Dilaudid and Fent patches...and I’m down to 12mg of Oxycodone per day. 
   
   In my state 4 years ago I was named Crohn’s and Colitis “Man of The Year” for my fundraising efforts and for counseling other folks in the same boat. In my whole city I’m the guy people come to for Crohn’s and Colitis help. That means the world to me. 
   
  I’m getting near the end of my taper like I said...and my anxiety is through the roof. I’ve been using medical pot for help and it’s been a big help. Unfortunately, I overdid it and used edibles and got Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Three absolutely terrifying ER trips two weeks ago. I have ceased all pot use for the time being naturally.
   
   I have a certified PTSD counselor I’ve met with once per week for the last two years, I juice, I have a thriving yoga practice, I drink 3 bottles of Essentia every day, I meditate through headspace every day, I use my Apple Watch for bio feedback, I quit coffee and alcohol, I take at least two baths per day and I walk at least three miles per day and I eat primarily nutrient dense food. I have arguably the greatest wife of all time and a beast of a Father who has been there for it all and never wavered. 
   
   I am processing all of this as I come off the drugs. I cry multiple times per day. Not even ashamed. It’s how I get all this shit out and heal. 
   
   The local ER and my new PCP will RX me everything under the sun but a rescue med.(A real one) I told my doctor about how some nights I’m pacing my house for literally hours. I’ve got Clonidine, Baclofen and Bispurone(Too afraid to take)
   
   I am getting my head kicked in every single day by major panic attacks. And I totally understand there is a major crackdown in my state on Benzos. Despite all of this...I am still crawling forward. I’m winning. Full on survival mode. It sounds arrogant and I am not an arrogant guy...but I am a fucking savage. I have been dealt some very unfortunate cards...this thing has almost killed me twice...it’s terrifying...it is absolutely terrifying. It might take me a minute sometimes...or a couple of days...but eventually...I stand up...I spit it in it’s fucking face and keep crawling forward. It’s not pretty...it’s not heroic it’s fucking war. And I’ve gotten to know a side of itself most people will not. And that’s pretty damn cool. Steal sharpens steal. I’m also, letting Christ back into my life...slowly(Really hard but worth it) I am so proud of myself.

But somebody please...help me understand...why a guy like me can’t get 5 Ativan for a month for a rescue med. Give me one single pill, so I can stare at it...and at least know I could end my suffering if I wanted. There’s power in that, at least for me. A few pills for when I lock up in a panic attack that lasts for more then an hour I do not think is an unreasonable request. 

But they make me feel like I’m dirty or something or like I’m a drug seeker. They are so good at it, it’s like it’s part of their fucking training. I know what’s coming and no matter what I say I get schooled. And they make me feel like a drug seeker for asking. “Don’t want you to get addicted.” 

“Bullshit.”

These are the same cats that were filling 100 Oxycodone/Ativan with one phone call from me just a few years ago. No questions asked. There ain’t nobody that understands and respects these meds more then me. 

I have my own nutritionist watching over what I eat...I just got the local college strength coach on my pay roll...and I meet with them once a month...and I am dead serious.

Despite all this...I am on the verge of getting myself out of this (with a lot of help)...it’s not even a hole anymore...I’ve drilled through bedrock...and I’m literally about to pull myself out of it and win. Again. 

I know people that get 10 to go on vacation for flights?

I know this all sounded arrogant, I humbly bow my head and take my hat off to everyone dealing with this. Totally not trying to out suffer anyone. A panic attack is a panic attack. We all suffer....I’m just wound up. 

But is there something in my chart? Does the DEA own these guys as much as I think they do? Anyone else running into this?",Flatts1205,2,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6pj17/somebody_shine_some_light/

We got angry and she said that we had already been giving her dirty looks so this was just an attempt to start a fight and that she wouldn’t let us ruin her day while walking away giving us the finger. Everyone around us looked at us like we were in the wrong for starting an argument or being upset and I felt really gross about the whole ordeal. 
It happened hours ago but I can’t help but keep thinking about it, which makes me anxious all over again, and I feel like the whole thing has just pushed me right back into the hermit mindset that I’ve felt most comfortable in during the pandemic. 


Does anyone have any tips on how to stop this cycle of replaying bad situations to avoid extra anxiety? Or tips on how to attempt getting back out of the hermit comfort zone especially after something like this?

Relaxation techniques but ineffective?,"Hi, sorry if this isn't the right place to post, I've gone thru the subreddit rules but still don't understand where to post, here or the monthly thread.

How do I get over obsessive regret related to a crush?,"Hi all,

Chronically anxiety-ridden college student here. Today is the last day of the semester and I had to say goodbye to my crush who is graduating. We flirted on and off the whole semester but due to my anxiety I never worked up enough courage to take it to the next level, and now I will most definitely never see him again. I've been had multiple anxiety attacks and meltdowns today due to the immense regret and anxiety I feel about the whole situation. I can't help but feel that if I had just gotten over my anxiety we might have been able to pursue a relationship and now my chances are over. My meds (buspirone) doesn't seem to be working and my therapist is already off-contract for the summer (I use my school's counseling services)

Do you guys have any help to stop ruminating over this? It seems to really be affecting me mentally and physically. I'm having chest pains from my anxiety which isn't something that has happened since I started my medication.

Anxiety about taking an anti-anxiety med,"The irony! 

Long story ahead: August 2020 I herniated a disc resulting in bad sciatica. Ended up having surgery in November, and then began having pain again at the end of December. February 2021 I got an MRI and found out I reherniated. A week after the MRI I had an episode of vertigo that lasted all day. Since then I've been having weird episodes of feeling off balance and foggy and an increase in anxiety. March 2nd I had a second surgery and there's definitely a good amount of anxiety surrounding the recovery. Pretty constant fear of reherniation, and because this was a nerve injury, it's a very non-linear recovery. Nerves are sensitive and can get fired up easily, and even cause pains and sensations as they heal. So lots of moments of being like, ""what is this new sensation?!""

I saw my PCP on Tuesday to talk about the weird dizzy spells I have, that sounds a lot like Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness. My PCP had never heard of this and she figured it's anxiety related to the surgery and recovery. She prescribed 30mg a day of Cymbalta to help with the anxiety and some of the nerve stuff. I took my first pill Tuesday evening, and took my Gabapentin later that night. Woke up at 11pm and was really dizzy and my whole body started tingling. The next day I felt super off. Was exhausted, couldn't focus, felt off balance and weak and had nausea off and on. Today started off fine, but as the day went on I just got more and more anxious. I haven't taken the Cymbalta or my Gabapentin since, and frankly I'm scared to try the Cymbalta again. Last thing I want/need is to feel totally out of it and off balance. It's important for me to get out and walk as much as possible and do my PT exercises to strengthen my back and keep the nerve moving, and now my anxiety is getting so bad I barely want to go past my block. So...seems like I definitely need the assist from the Cymbalta, but I'm also really afraid of the side effects. Also to throw a wrench into this, my PCP who prescribed it left the practice this week and now I need to find a new doctor so I can't just reach out to her with my fears.",jen8978,4,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6k7ji/anxiety_about_taking_an_antianxiety_med/
Anxiety in job interviews,"I’ve had anxiety my entire life since I can remember. One of my earliest memories is being curled up in the fetal position on the family living room couch feeling lost and anxious for no reason. 

Therapy my whole life etc. my life is good.  Currently I’m trying to find a new, fulfilling job. 

I had a job interview last week that I crushed. I’m not a super confident person, but I feel confident about that interview. 

Today was interview two with the company. It was over zoom and there were two interviewers vs one person over the phone. 

I feel as if I was “good” in the interview. I did not feel confident. 

I think what gets me nervous is people looking at me. I HATE the spotlight. 

I have another zoom interview with a company I REALLY want the job for, round one, on Monday. Two people are interviewing me. 

Any tips on calming the f down? Thinking clearly and not letting my tornado of a mind take me up in a whirlwind? I am qualified for both these jobs and fit in very well with their values and am passionate about their causes. I just get so dang anxious! 

I scheduled this meeting in the morning so I don’t have all day to freak out like I did today (resulting in not able to accomplish other tasks, upset stomach, shakes) , but I’m not a morning person at all so I’m sure I’ll be anxious about that and not sleep 😖

DAE have severe anxiety around determinism and free will?,"For the past few weeks, I have been in an anxious spiral about determinism and the illusion of free will. I have had anxiety my whole life I believe. I'm in therapy and I just got prescribed a new med that I will start tomorrow.

I believe I am experiencing DP/DR (it is something I have dealt with on and off) around it but I'm not sure. I keep ruminating about free will. My every action that I take (including writing this) I keep thinking how I did not truly choose, how it was caused by some molecular process unbeknownst to me, how the whole of who I am is just a collection of stimuli. And what's odd is that I didn't think otherwise before this happened but all of a sudden, every action is terrifying because I don't experience it as mine. Just now I started eating pizza and it scared me as I didn't actively choose to do so. I know we do tons of things unconsciously but again, my anxiety makes me feel like I am a calculator. 

I've been obsessing googling on it and I have read on compatiblism (which is a semantic shift, it seems) and just accepting it is an illusion. But accepting that makes me feel like i'm strapped to a rocket hurling toward something and I am immensely afraid.

When I try to practice mindfulness and see the thoughts and feelings as thoughts, my brain fights back and says I'm just denying the truth. At one point, I didn't want to eat because I thought ""Did I choose to eat or did several seconds before I was aware, neuronal process started and I was always going to eat."" I feel like an automation and I am seeing everyone around me as such.

I know my anxiety is probably clouding my thinking and I have had moments of calm where I wasn't as bothered. But then I begin to question further, thinking how terrifying it is that my sense of self and thinking could be influenced so heavily. And the thought spiral continues. It makes it hard to do the things that I know can help because I think ""I have no control if it happens. I can only hope I will do the things to alleviate my suffering.""

She wrote me after 8 months of no contact to blame me for her pain,"She wrote me saying this 8 months after no contact through the mail and just the way she wrote it seems so hurt and pointing blame. Following this will be my side of it and it just makes me so sad because I have CLEAR EXAMPLES of how it was not the case that she wrote. I have been unpacking it once a week in therapy. 

Dear (x), I found out I was pregnant late January 2020 after we had used protection and I took a Plan-B pill. I told you that I was pregnant immediately when I found out. You instantly freaked out and told me that you did not want to have a child. I asked you why and you said that you had too much going on in your life and listed so many reasons as to why you did not want to have a child. You broke my heart and I felt so rejected by you voicing this objection. After this interaction with my you, I felt extremely alone and did not know what to do. I felt abandoned by you and I felt that I could not rely on you to take care of me and our child. I sunk into a deep depression and anxiety and thought about killing myself multiple times a day. I did not feel like I could take care of a child … I had just been hit by a truck and was still struggling with numerous physical and psychological problems due to the accident. I also had no job, no money, large school debt, and just so many other unstable factors in my life at the time. It was probably one of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make to terminate the pregnancy and that is something I will always be living with. I had an intentional miscarriage in and I hope to never be in that situation again in my life. I am left feeling hurt, angry, and sad by all of this. 

Now my part: Before reading this I must say this, it is long but for the purpose of context. I am a caring person and as you read I hope you will know that I tried to do everything with no malicious intent and just no intent for hurt. Yet she doesn't see this and that kills me because she only sees what she interpreted.

I am 26 and she is 28. 

My ex and I were together for 6 years. 

We almost never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things, those were usually civil conversations voicing issues or concerns then discussing how we can fix them together or individually.  We met in college, moved in together in secret from her parents for 3 years, then moved apart to our parents(only 15 minutes apart) as we finished college. 

Now for what happened:

My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.

She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and constantly made decisions to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Or she hid us living together for 3 years because her parents believe in marriage first. Her father - he doesnt hold his tongue. One time he threatened to divorce her mom had he not got his way with demanding his daughters boyfriend to leave the house. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 

My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.

So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021 on our anniversary because we would have had jobs and such, as well she told me I needed to ask her parents and they wanted me to have a career in place to support their daughter. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.

Traumatic Event:

We are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it had failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have had moments of horrible anxiety which she knew about. For example, my dad had a heart attack and my anxiety caused me to have a panic attack. My panic in this moment of the pregnancy is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and EXTREMELY intrusive thoughts. I normally have intrusive thoughts as my primary anxiety symptom. 

These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. But I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me since this has happened before marriage as you said before how much they value that."" ""I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all these circumstances."" ""I will be a first year teacher and that will mean I need to work a bunch outside of school to plan lessons and such and I dont want all of the responsibilities to be on you."" ""I just dont feel ready."" ""I grew up poor and I dont want you to ever deal with that."" ""I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all of these circumstances."" My panic turned into a trance where I thought and voiced ""I just dont know or feel ready to be a father."" 

She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I have always pushed myself. Its what motivates me. She agrees but still seems really sad, and she goes home then after this. Texting me how sad she felt because that was suppose to be a happy moment for a couple to experience but my panic attack and anxiety made her feel worried. (As I said nothing I was saying was false during my panic attack, it was all real issues we were facing right then. We didnt have jobs, we didnt live together, we were not engaged, and she was recovering from an accident she was involved in.) She told me she felt worried, and I just told her we need to figure everything out and it will be okay. I also would preface I was saying ""i dont know if I am ready to be a father because.... then listing reasons above (no job, not married, not living together, first year teacher would mean she would need to step up a bunch since I would be doing a lot of work outside of work to plan). 

I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast half of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby out of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 

Now, another week later, not as emotionally charged from the news of an unexpected pregnancy, I wrote her a letter explaining my panic, apologizing for the hurt she felt directly from my panic, and how I was not worried about me specifically but rather worried about how I was going to take care of her and our baby. ""My intrusive thoughts came out as I am not ready, but really I meant I dont know how I will figure everything out such as finding work, getting engaged and marrying you so your parents are not mad at you and I, and I just dont want you and I to struggle like my parents did."" As well with this letter I give my pros and cons to each option but preface with saying that whatever I say does not matter because I cannot make the decision and further, I will support whatever she decides. We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security and her being on recovery from the accident. She NEVER mentions before the abortion about my own panic and not being able to rely on me. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.

She tells me about pain, and so we go to the emergency room as she is worried about an eptopic pregnancy. I am in the room holding her hand and when they tell her its not, I feel relief and I am happy everything is fine. Yet she doesn't seem to see this. 

After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month until the abortion looking for work 8 hours a day. She didnt see this because she and I lived seperately. I would tell her I am looking, but I just assume now she felt hurt and didnt believe me and my effort since all she already took from everything was that I didnt want to have a child with her, which honestly swear to god was not the case at all. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat especially as a teacher and so I was looking elsewhere for whatever I could find.  Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.

Another week and at this point we are going together to ALL of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I WANT to keep our baby, but I also see the pros if we go with abortion we can get careers and set up our lives and not struggle financially then plan to have children, but if not, then I still want children in our future with her. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision. I tell her it kills me to be leaning towards abortion because I have wanted to have a family with her and be married to her for so long now. But finances have held me back and thus why now that we graduated I look forward to the next few years in that we can make money, get married, and have kids. It kills me to this day we went with an abortion. I tell her that I believe abortion is our best option given our circumstances but to be clear I still want a family with her in the future when we are more financially ready (both having jobs).

Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.

A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 

The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 

It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.

We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. Almost like having a PTSD episode after sex, I tend to calm her down each time and I understand her anxiety. I continue to tell her if she doesn't want to we dont have to until she feels comfortable. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs. 

Fast forward to the break up (NONE OF THIS WAS SAID BEFORE THE BREAKUP): she tells me that I was unsupportive, and that my actions were shit. She said if I cared I would have proposed to her, I would have found a job, and that my panic attack showed her that I didnt care about her. This hurt because all of this was wrong. I tried telling her but she just kept saying she cant trust nor rely on me any longer. She said that I was not the man she thought and that I broke her heart into a thousand pieces. She said that my actions showed her and this just killed me because I tried... I truly did. But she had these expectations that seemed like she wanted me to have a job, propose, and make sure we keep the baby all within a month before the abortion because ""if i did that I would have shown I cared"". Further she took my panic attack that was worrying about realistic things and even more so focused on how I would provide her with stability and happiness and said that when I panicked it showed her that none of this was right. She said ""when a baby is announced it is suppose to be an amazing moment for a couple, but you ruined it and made me feel rejected and made me panic. Had you not panicked I likely would never have considered the abortion."". As I detailed above I was as supportive as I could have been and she just lived by these expectations and when they were not met, she blamed me despite my efforts. ""Your efforts were shit. You could have done it if you really cared and you know that. But you just choose to blame it on your anxiety."" 

This ^ has been the most traumatic thing in my life. Abortion and then for her to blame me during the breakup 8 months afterwards. But not once talk about those feelings before.

6 months later after the abortion... 

Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy work schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 

Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). 

She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. 

Now to the most current thing:


We argue about her not giving me any time to see her (1 day a week and only for a couple hours) then she says that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.

2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.

A week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me/kick my brain mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. I didnt argue at all but listened and apologized.

She tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. ""Had you not reacted the way you did, I likely would not have chosen to get an abortion."" She said. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident.

Then she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. 

She removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. Then months after she blocked me. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially ""Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions"" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. 

Since our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me BECAUSE of my anxiety. I blame myself deeply for having a panic attack and having anxiety. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.

I have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. 

I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue.

I tried to communicate but it just feels like now she only listened to what she wanted to hear and only saw the actions she wanted to see, which unfortunately are the ones that hurt her. I told her I never intended any hurt, pain, rejection, or trust breaking. I realize intent or not she was hurt, and would ask how she could forgive me. Unfortunately she wouldn't forgive me and left me with chances, like ""I have given you more chances then I should and I just continue to get hurt."" To which I just felt like it was a losing battle since I never once repeated my mistakes once they were brought to my attention I tried diligently to never do them again. Panic attack - therapeutic options explored, taking the test and arguing about my family - cut off my family members, struggling with depression and not seeing her but 1 day a week and having times of negativity and crying during that day - when mentioned I got onto depression medication and started therapy and even asked her to go to therapy together. She kept score of her hurts and would not forgive me despite not repeating mistakes.

I honestly feel like since breaking up, she considers me her reason for her trauma. She blamed me a bunch during the breakup. It kills me because I am a very caring person and even just knowing this has made me contemplate suicide because it kills me to think that she feels that I did any of this to hurt her or cause her trauma.

What is your take on my story with my ex? 

TLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after her abortion and blaming me because she felt rejected, like she couldn't trust or rely on me, and blamed me for my anxiety attack. She blames me for being unsupportive and says I was not there for her when she needed me, yet I feel I was but just not up to her expectations.",EcstaticBunny,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6rn5m/she_wrote_me_after_8_months_of_no_contact_to/
My voice feels shaky/trembly every time i talk doesn’t matter the situation. Anyone else?,"I have suffered with anxiety for about 11 years roughly, i am currently 29.

I am always clearing my throat too, i do suffer with mild acid reflux but my throat can get hoarse, mucus at the back and just irritated.

I’m scared to take medicine I’ve taken 1000 times.,"Title says it all. For a year and a half I have work up with crippling anxiety that has kept me out of work, going hardly anywhere and doing anything. I literally stay home. It’s like my brain is stuck in fight or flight and I automatically choose flight everytime. It’s a battle I’m exhausted and everyday it’s just a mental toll to get through the day. As a younger kid I used to take 1mg Xanax 3 times a day. Well as I got older I eventually tapered down to .5mg one time a day. And shortly before my son was born I had a breakdown and I have been stuck like this. I hardly take my medicine. I take a literal crumble of the medicine. It makes 1/4 of a .5mg pill look massive. As to why I don’t know.  I’m sure it would solve 90% of my problems and just let me function atleast but honestly I’m scared. As stated I’ve taken this medicine for years and in large(prescribed of course) doses. So why is a single .5mg pill so scary to me now. I am just so afraid of a bad reaction it has crippled me and it’s like I not even willing to help my self. For some reason I’m just afraid if I take it I’ll have a meltdown, I’ve never had one before taking it but I don’t know. Any tips or advice. I’m In between a rock and a hard place I’ve got to do something. I can’t keep living like this I just am so terrified for no reason.  I guess I’m just afraid if I take my normal anxiety which is more than I can handle and for someone reason had a bad reaction I literally don’t know if I could physically or mentally  take it.

Worst anxiety I’ve had in my life,"I’m not joking for some reason my anxiety is extremely bad. The worst I’ve ever had it. 

It had me in the emergency room twice back to back, convinced me to be scared of taking any medication due to being anxious of somehow having an allergic reaction to them, being afraid to eat due to the fear of having a allergic reaction to ingredients in food, losing so much sleep because I notice my breathing slowing down or it feels like I forget to breathe so I get really anxious. 

This started when one night I was falling asleep and “noticed” my breathing was “off” and it triggered the worst panic attack of my life to where I ended up going to the hospital over it the next day AND the day after that. 

It’s making me focus on my breathing due to it feeling like I forgot to breathe and it just makes it harder to breathe easier!

I don’t know why it triggered me so much. I do have health anxiety and after that incident it has gotten worse. I’m even anxious to take my new anxiety medicine!

Can anxiety trigger anger?,"Over the past year my anxiety has been getting worse and worse.. and I have a lot of these moments where I get angry.. and I feel like it is my anxiety causing it. There are just times I get really really irritable when I am in the middle of cleaning the house and someone starts messing with things and moving things around that I just cleaned up or I might be working on something and I start getting frustrated. There are also many times where my anxiety will be bothering me and I just start getting angry, and at times I tend to take this out on those around me. And I recognize in my head that I shouldn’t be acting that way, and that they didn’t do anything wrong but I still will yell and get all worked up.. Honestly sometimes this makes me feel like I’m going crazy.. I just have these blind rages it seems. I just wondered if there is anyone on here who also have these issues or anything similar? And if so how do you handle it and try and get control of yourself?

I used to not believe in anxiety.,"Maybe this is what I get for thinking it’s “all in their head,” for years. My anxiety is through the roof. Specifically, I get health anxiety. I’ve been to the doctor for an ultrasound on my leg several times in a year. Now, my hands are shaking and my lip shakes/twitches/tremors sometimes. The logic in me says that I am going through a period of high anxiety, which can cause these shakes, the health anxiety me says I have a deadly disease. I’ve been doing therapy, but I think I need CBT. I was prescribed Zoloft, and after 5 days, I felt worse than ever before. I stopped taking it, and felt much better. I was prescribed lexapro, but I’m afraid to take it because of the Zoloft. But...my anxiety is so bad. Also, my tremors started the week I took Zoloft, so maybe that caused it. I saw it can take 18 months to go away. I guess, I just feel really stupid for ever down playing anxiety. It’s real, it’s hard, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

Any women here looked into an ADHD diagnosis?,"Hi everyone,

I recently converted to long-term therapy.  She suggested that some of my anxious habits sound like ADHD, which is super under diagnosed in women, and a lot of women have overlapping anxiety disorders.

I have racing thoughts, but that seems very typical to my panic disorder.  I can't focus on conversations if I'm not interested, I have to do 5 things at once, I can't stand quiet, I don't do things til last minute if they seem overwhelming, I'm incredibly disorganized, forgetful, and I procrastinate.

However I can also get in the zone, and I'm moderately successful in my career.  So I'm not sure if her assessment is correct.

“Why do you think you were anxious?”,"This is me reminiscing a bit, so ignore if you’re not into that. It happened a few months after I had gone on anxiety meds and finally started taking my mental health seriously. 

About two years ago when I was settling into my position after having been working a year, I was walking the production floor when my heart started to feel funny. Like it was too tired to really pump. To me it felt like my arms would after a hard workout the day before. 

I got through the rest of my walk and got back to the office and it still felt like that. My head felt a little spaced out, and breathing was tense. I mentioned to my coworker that I felt off, and after a series of events I got loaded into an ambulance and taken to the ER. A few hours later I was told I had a panic attack and was now good to go. 

It was my first panic attack not triggered by any mental situation, although it was a stressful time in my life. My main doctors believed that the residual chemicals of my anxiety just built up enough to actually trigger an attack. It definitely sucked but oh well. Stay the course and it shouldn’t happen again. 

I get back to work the next day and lay it all out for my manager and explained it was labeled an anxiety attack, and followed up the next week with my docs saying I was good to go. 

Well, a week later I get called into her office with HR present. We run through the whole situation again including what the docs said. 

And then she asks me what made me anxious. 

Now I’m a very literal person in the best of times, so I answered her question as literally as I could. 

“Because the chemicals in my brain were messed up.”

The story to all this is that your anxiety is not your fault. There won’t be a neat answer to everything. However, if you stay the course and listen to your med team, your symptoms can still be managed, ignorant (although maybe well meaning) people be damned.

"When you guys DO get out of your comfort zone, what helped you do it?","Basically title. In times where you have successfully done something you were afraid of, how did you think about the task in order to do it? I'm about to rant a bit but -

I am dealing with depression and anxiety. I believe the consequences of the anxiety is what has caused the depression. There were some times in childhood I dealt with depression (I remember struggling with death when I was four, trying hard to understand what happens after life), but mainly I have been plagued by anxiety more than anything – and I believe it’s negative effects on my life have caused the majority of my depression. If people deal with stress in a fight or flight way, I definitely fall into flight. I will legitimately scare myself with my own shadow sometimes, jumping in the air and getting a mini panic attack by my shadow being there (no joke). People asking me questions absolutely terrifies me. Basically, I fear leaving my comfort zone much more than anyone else I have ever met. This has caused me to not be able to communicate with the closest people in my life, losing people that mean the world to me. I can’t get to a job interview without throwing up (even if I know i'm overqualified). I'm not able to walk up to a girl, even if her friend tells me she wants me to. I appear to be lazy, but I’m really a highly determined, afraid person. I don’t know how to leave my comfort zone, it legit stresses me out much more than my car crash did (somehow I dealt with that just fine?). I do believe if I can get better at leaving my comfort zone I will be unstoppable, I just don’t know if I will get there. The weird thing is sometimes I do things that other people fear with ease (saying it like it is, accepting things that suck). But the things that do scare me (communication, commitment), are really a wall. I also fear embarrassing myself. And I actually don’t really care what others think too much. I fear looking back at myself and being embarrassed of myself. I think of old things I thought and did and feel shame, and worry that will happen again. I’m basically afraid of letting myself down. Hopefully I will get through it. But I have an interview tomorrow and I'm wondering what you guys think about outside of it to feel a bit more comfortable.

Large celebration focused on me. Had an emotional breakdown after it was over.," Over the weekend, there was a large celebration of about 50 colleagues including me, where they were congratulating me on a big accomplishment at work. Once I heard that this was happening, I knew I wasn't going to be able to handle it well. Thankfully I had my mask on during most of the hour and a half long event. All eyes were focused on me for most of the time during the event. They had me come up to the front and take pictures. At the end, many people started coming up to me to congratulate, some of whom I have never met. Thank god they didn't ask for a speech on the stage.

I wouldn't say that I'm a total introvert. I have certain small groups of people that I can really have a good conversation with. If there are 3-4 people in the group with me, I can handle it. But that was just too much. I got home and let out all of my emotions for some strange reason, which is a huge first for me. I didn't know that could happen. I can appreciate what they did for me, but it was just too much to handle all of those eyes on me the entire night.",mthc995,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6mxtr/large_celebration_focused_on_me_had_an_emotional/

Anxiety attack or med side effects?,"For the past 3 to 4 days I have been experiencing increased anxiety and irritability. I've also had some trouble sleeping, even when taking a sleep aid. Today my anxiety skyrocketed for no apparent reason and I've been quick to anger and irritable. I also started having neck, upper back and jaw pain (just feels tense and uncomfortable) the neck tension is the worst. I've been easy to get hot and have a headache. And now I can feel heart palpitations and startle easily. 

I want to note I am on Adderall, only 10mg BID. I never experience physical symptoms of the stimulant unless I don't take it with a meal, and it actually improves my irritability. I've been on this dose for over a month and never had issues before. 

I'm wondering though if maybe these symptoms see side effects just now showing up for some reason or if maybe I am experiencing an anxiety attack. I've been stressed lately due to my career (it is extremely high stress, working at a hospital), and not really being able to relax when I come home due to a child in the home who is very loud and hyperverbal.

"The dam broke, trying to build it back","After years of managing to keep my anxiety in check, the last few weeks made the wall that I build around it crumbled.

Ever since I was young  all I ever felt was anxiety, and the thing that made a good or bad day was how anxious I was. I started taking medication (sertraline) and it helped but at that point I was already starting to build a mental blockade around my anxiety. 

The thing is, Anxiety wasn't the only thing that stayed inside. Everything got locked in there. There as never been a thing that I really enjoyed doing. Everything is just kind of a pastime. I don't feel happy doing it, but I also don't feel sad. 

The only thing that could leak thought this dam that I build was anxiety, but I could manage it ok. It was annoying, but I could still function. 

Got through the first and second year of uni fine, even when covid came at the end of the second one. I made really good friends here, some of the best people I have ever met in my life, but I feel like was never really being honest with then, because, after all, all I was feeling was anxiety, I didnt know any other emotion. I knew I liked being around then, but I could never point any specific thing about then that made me like then. 

And then shit hit the fan

Someone close to me had a breakdown, very serious one.

I think i managed to help, my friend got medical help, and is doing much better now. But after the dust settled and the shock was over, my brain just completely melted.

I started having 2 to 3 panics attacks per day. I was able to manage then for about a week, but after that they were going full force on me and I couldn't do anything about it.

The dam had broken. And on top of that shit ton of anxiety I had stored over the years, every other emotion that I had never had to deal with rushed in all at once.


All of a sudden I wasn't just dealing with anxiety, I was also dealing with being sad, scared, and feeling worthless. I am now not only dealing with panic attacks, but also just crying myself to sleep and feeling like shit in general.

I think that I have never loved or hated anything. It was all just meh. And now I have no fucking clued of what to do.

I just want to build it back up. Fell nothing again, it's much better that way. Right now I'm taking Xanax and it's the only thing that is keeping me from going absolute insane.

I just want it to stop. I want to stop feeling at all.

I want to build this wall again and make sure it's strong enough to never fucking break again",saddudeUwU,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6mkew/the_dam_broke_trying_to_build_it_back/
Anxious over cleaning chemicals,"Today the drains got cleaned with Liquid Fire (contains sulfuric acid, I believe) and I have been paranoid about. I've had panic attack after panic attack. First because of the fumes, knowing that they're toxic and second regarding having had contact with it. I wasn't the one who put it in the drains. I had no contact with it beyond fumes (and the rooms were ventilated). That all happened early today and the drains have all been cleaned out since. I'm scared that I will end up touching or ingesting it somehow. I don't like it inside. The worst thing is that I know I had no contact and so this shouldn't be something making me anxious.

Looking for opinions on a strange panic/anxiety cause!,"I had a sinus infection two months ago. A week later, I had a panic attack while driving after rolling my window up. I didn’t realize it was an attack, I just thought I had too much caffeine. A week later, I had a severe sudden panic attack that sent me to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. They said “panic disorder.” I then started to suffer from DR for days after that attack and then it improved. I was constantly anxious and having panic attacks daily...I couldn’t drive, could barely leave the house. Had more intense panic attacks and went to the ER twice more. I also noticed my ears were painful, like stabbing my eardrum pain and my sinuses felt like balloons when I would lay down, but I didn’t have a runny nose so I assumed maybe allergies or just a weird symptom of panic...Cue more panic. They put me on anti-depressants and short term klonopin, recommended me to counseling. Which I started all but the anti-depressants.

The constant anxiety had me in constant fear of panic attacks so then I started having intrusive thoughts at night, especially after taking klonopin. Klonopin actually made me feel like I was just insane and would never be normal again. 

I saw my PCP yesterday who noticed my WBC has been high my last two blood draws. I asked her to check my ears...It turns out I have a pretty severe sinus infection and both of my ear drums are bulging from the pressure, with infection in one ear. We all know that ear pressure issues can cause dizziness and weird sensations in the body..Labyrinthitis (inner ear infection) can actually cause derealization which leads to panic attacks and anxiety.

I’m two doses of antibiotics in and I’m feeling from 10% to 60% better as far as the anxiety and panic. I haven’t needed klonopin and I haven’t really freaked out over my heartbeat, I’ve been able to see things around me and not feel so weird and off. I’m definitely not 100% here and do feel anxiety flare up a little when I start overthinking...but I’m not feeling so uncomfortable in my own body like I had for days. We also had a tornado hit the house I’m house sitting in Monday so that brought on some panic and anxiety all day Tuesday, but today I feel pretty good. Do you think it’s possible my anxiety and panic stemmed directly from the ear issue so now that I’m treating the infection, the secondary symptoms of the anxiety and panic should cease? OR is it possible I’ve just convinced myself it’s because of my ears and my improvement is the “placebo” affect?

My doctor is ghosting me. What do I do?,"I’ve emailed and called my doctor’s office several times over the past 9 days asking questions about my new anti-anxiety medication as well as asking if I can get a refill on my previous prescription of Xanax to help overcome my anxiety until the new medication (Lexapro) kicks in.

I’m panicking because I leave in 4 days and will be out of town for a few weeks so I’d like to get some resolutions before being on the road. I also don’t have enough time at this point to try and find a new doctor to administer medication. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like my doctor is ghosting me.

Feeling anxious and stupid,"Hi everyone

Tomorrow I go to get my 2nd and final vaccine shot (Pfizer). The first one went well, I had a sore arm and a swollen lymph node (that I didn't even know existed - doctor confirmed it was a normal side effect and would go down, which it did, I can still feel it if I prod and poke but I'm now accepting this is probably normal)

I'm quite young (29) but have been vaccinated early due to medications I take for Bipolar disorder. Alongside my bipolar I suffer with Generalised anxiety. Frustratingly my moods are stable through medication but anxiety is a constant battle, although I have managed to overcome panic attacks for the most part.

I keep worrying and fretting almost to the point of panic that I'll experience anaphylaxis or I'll have terrible side effects (I have anxiety over raised body temperatures and fevers) I was very lucky the first time around, so surely this time it's gonna hit me like a bus? 

I just feel... stupid. And I'm sorry if this post seems like i'm ungrateful, I'm absolutely not, and I do want to be vaccinated fully because the COVID anxiety itself was awful. But now I have anxiety over this?!

Just wanted to share my thoughts in a space where I'd feel safe to do so, and won't feel judged. I hate anxiety, and I AM going to get the vaccine so in one sense I'm not letting my anxiety control my actions, but I still can't shake off the feeling.",scrplvr,3,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6dedt/feeling_anxious_and_stupid/

-Lexapro 10mg and 20 mg
-Pristiq 50 mg
-buspar 15 mg/day now 30 mg/day (currently taking) 
-Remeron 7.5 a night now 15 mg a night (currently taking) 

I am also on Naltraxone 50 mg a day for my cravings for alcohol and depo Provera shot for birth control. Both of these I like being on and as far as I can tell give me minimal side effects that I can notice but I don't know if they could be affecting my anxiety CPTSD or depression.

This sucks because I didn't even want to do it. It's a good job. I love my coworkers. I enjoy the work I do well enough, and I'm good at it when I'm not like this. And my coworkers all apparently think I'm doing great (although they REALLY don't know how untrue that is. Good luck with all the fires I left.). 

My poor boss. One of my coworkers also gave informal notice today and it's a tiny office, so all around, not a great day for him.

Anyone else get anxiety from worrying they will never stop having anxiety?,"Recently I started to get bad anxiety again, nearly having a panic attack about a week ago. Recently I've been having more anxiety, but this time about my anxiety. And I did have a panic attack last night.

My thoughts go like this:

""My head feels so out of control, I cant relax, and I cant get a break, I'm exhausted.""

""What if this never stops? What if I cant sleep? What if it goes on for days and years? What if I'm like this the rest of my life?""

""What if I go insane and kill myself? Why am I thinking of suicide. Will I be pushed to that? Will I have to fight this every day for the rest of my life?""

The thought itself is repulsive and irrational. I dont think I will go insane, I know the thought is irrational and if it went away I wouldnt have to worry about it. But my mind is telling me it's a real threat which triggers the panic. 

A few years ago I had a really bad year for anxiety, almost constant the whole year until I read something that almost suddenly fixed it. I'm worried that will happen again, but this time there wont be such a fix.

Just wondering if anyone else shares this. That's what helped me before. I was getting intrusive thoughts and had no idea they were common and not very serious. When I read that they were it was like a storm cloud went away. 

I've had this particular anxiety for about a week now, I know it's not me and not normal. But I'm afraid of it becoming normal because my idiot brain is having a crisis. Then I start worrying about developing a disorder and spiraling out of control.

Freeway Anxiety,"I have had my driver's license for 2.5 years. Ever since I got it, I've taken residential roads everywhere. It takes me up to an hour of driving to get to an appointment 20 minutes away. When my dad would take me driving on the freeway, my heart would race and my vision would blur and I felt unbelievably anxious and unsafe. I completely gave up trying for a year and a half.

Finally, I decided I couldn't live like this anymore. Because of the safety risk (to myself and others) that I would cause by just exposure therapy-ing my way out of it, I started really slow. First I got comfortable with large, multilane residential roads. I got comfortable with changing lanes. I tried to improve my driving skills as much as possible and take risks/drive in new scary areas whenever I felt ready for it. I took friends with me so they could help advise me if I got too scared. I continued this process for a few months. Then, I started to transition to taking highways (faster than normal roads, but not controlled access). I got comfortable with the faster speeds over the course of a few more months.

Last week, I asked my dad to accompany me on the freeway for my first try since I gave up. As we sat in the turn lane for the entrance ramp, I felt my heart start to race. I questioned if we should just turn around and go home, maybe try again another day. But I knew that if I allowed myself to do that after all the work I had done, it would only make it up to be even scarier in my head. So, I did it. It was scary, but I did a really good job and after a few minutes I began to feel relaxed. People had always told me that it isn't scary because you are completely in control- but that's exactly what terrified me. This time, I understood. I felt in control, and that allowed me to relax. A couple of days later, my roommate offered to drive with me- nailed it again. Today, for the first time ever, I drove on the freeway alone. I was so nervous, but it wasn't that bad! The only mistake I made was getting off at the wrong exit, but I got right back on and saw it as an opportunity for more entrance ramp practice, which is the scariest part for me.

It seems like a weird thing to be so proud of since millions of people do it at least twice every single day, but it has been the source of so much anxiety and self-loathing for me. I just wanted to share this because over the past 2 years everyone has just told me to get over it, but that wasn't an option, and it isn't for many people with anxiety.

Am I being really stupid?,"(This turned into kind of a long post. Tl;dr below.)

I've recently had my depression and anxiety come to a head, so to speak, and have been trying to take steps to address those issues. However, I can't seem to get past pretty crippling anxiety when it comes to my job. The annoying part is that it's a really good job. My company is super understanding, pays me incredibly well, has amazing benefits, and has a ton of flexibility. 

Unfortunately it's a sales job, and though I've somehow managed to work my way up in my career to achieving this position, I've never wanted to be a sales person. It does happen to be selling a great product, and not even in a high-pressure way (most of my job is account maintenance really), and also is in an industry I really love (though I feel pretty burnt out with it), which has made my job bearable and sometimes even enjoyable up 'til now, despite working in sales. 

I just can't get myself to do it. Every day it gets worse, and then I feel guilty for not doing enough when they've been as understanding as they have been, and that makes my anxiety even worse. It's gotten past the point of being acceptable though. I just physically can't get myself to do my job unless something happens that I absolutely have to address. It makes me feel physically sick to think about trying.

I feel like I'm being really stupid. Why can't I do this job that isn't even that hard? Am I being an absolute baby about this and just need to suck it up and try harder? I feel so worn down by trying to clench my teeth and just grit through life with a smile plastered on my face, but when I look at this objectively I feel like I'm just throwing away an opportunity that other people would be so grateful for and work so hard to do well in if given the chance.

I'm looking at stepping into other things that are lower pressure, but I've been in the same industry and in sales so long, it's extremely difficult to sidestep into anything that would pay me similarly. I interviewed with a place today that would be practically making half of what I am now, but I know I would be able to do it and not feel like I'm going to have a melt down every day. Finances would obviously be a lot tighter, but I think I can just barely make it work and be slightly financially stressed.

I have an appointment tomorrow morning with my PCP to talk about something specifically for my anxiety to add to what I'm taking for depression at the suggestion of my therapist and ranking as severe on the general anxiety disorder test she gave me. I guess I just need someone outside my life to be honest and tell me if I'm just being an annoying priveleged jerk for throwing away a super stable job that treats me super well. Thank you for reading if you got this far. If nothing else, it helps to vent about it a bit.

Tl;dr: I have a good, stable, easy job that pays well and has amazing benefits in an industry I like, but a job that I don't, but my anxiety is making it almost impossible to do it so I think I might quit.

Self inflicted,"Okay so let me start by saying that I already think of myself as a piece of actual garbage, and I totally understand if after reading this some of you feel the need to remind me of it. With that being said, I never really dealt with anxiety or panic in my life up until about 5 months ago. I’ve been in the same relationship for almost 6 years. We live together and have 2 beautiful children. In the past, we were not very healthy in our communication. There were times where I would break up with her and go out and chase women, just to get back with her in the following days. I justified it in my head because we were “broken up”. This repeated itself for a few years. Well, 5 months ago I came clean about everything I had ever done. She was devastated naturally, but chose to give me another shot (she’s so fucking good and kind). Since that time, I’ve had terrible anxiety and panic attacks that come in waves. My self esteem is gone and I just generally hate being in my own head. I have lived exclusively for my family, started eating healthy, stopped smoking and drinking, got back in the gym, and anything else I could think of to lead the life of an honest and committed father/boyfriend. I feel such extreme guilt and shame for what I did in my past. My girlfriend wants me to move on and be present, but I just cannot get over this mental block. I was in therapy for 3 months, and I always see short term results. My headspace is like a crypto currency graph, up and down.

First Panic Attack,"Hi folks!  I have had a recent bout with anxiety for about 2 months...and it has gotten worse over the past few weeks.  Last night, this culminated in a full blown Panic Attack!

I just wanted to share my thoughts as I hope they can be helpful for me to type out, and for others to read.

The attack came on slow, and may have been due to taking my first very small dose edible (which I now realize was NOT a good idea).  So starting at about 6pm the questions of ""am I walking straight?"" ""do I sound normal?"" started happening.  My wife said I seemed totally fine on the outside.

When it really started getting worse was around 8pm when we met up with her mom at a restaurant and we ate inside.  Ever been super anxious, inside a restaurant, feeling stoned from an edible for the first time ever?  It's not fun.  It came in waves, but the whole time I was unable to eat anything...just staring at the food on my plate knowing I wouldn't be able to eat it.

  
Eventually it got so bad I had to remove myself from the restaurant and head home separately.  Getting home was no issue.  That night, at 11pm...BOOM.  The panic attack hit and it was probably 45 minutes of pacing, drinking tea, and talking to my wife before I was able to calm down enough and my nervous system calmed down.

Today, the anxiety I am feeling is ""will that happen again?""  I just want you to know that Panic Attacks DO happen, but they will not kill you and they WILL end.

Happy to hear any tips on managing attacks.",pinkflyd25,2,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6dsc6/first_panic_attack/
Screwed up something simple now I’m freaking out,"I had to give stool sample I was instructed before being handed the samples kit to take home that I would need to put my name and Date of birth on each sample, so I wait a few days to collect the samples at good time, when it felt right, when I had some free time and there wasn’t gonna be any interruptions. Come time to do the deed I get ready to write my name on each bottle but each bottle simply asked for name, date and time. Being an idiot I interpreted this as putting the date and time the sample was taken, so that’s what I write.

My story,"Hello!

I'm fairly new to this sub, even though I have been struggling with anxiety for the past three years. It all started Somewhere in 2018, a period where I have been drinking alcohol heavily. I have literally spent that entire year drinking, partying, etc. every single day/night. Had marriage issues and work was very stressful (funeral director). Then one day I got home, cooked some food, went to bed and woke up to rush to the bathroom to kiss my porcelain prince. From that day on, I have developed emetophobia and it has been haunting me ever since (even though I rarely, if ever, V\* - can literally count three times I did, and it was all alcohol induced), but it has also triggered severe anxiety (social mostly) and depression. I have lost quite a lot of weight, even though I have reduced alcohol consumption to a minimum, quit smoking and switched to vaping. Also got an amicable divorce because wife and I thought it was for the best (it was a very toxic relationship/marriage), and got left alone with a child and a fairly large financial debt, and everyone thinks that triggered my anxiety.

I currently consume an anxiolytic in the morning (Eglonyl 50mg - sulpiride), and a Xanax alternative (Misar 0,25mg) when shit hits the fan or before an ""important"" event, which is actually not that important or stressful.

Anyway, I have tried everything - read self-help books, meds (which only put me in a zombie-like state and make me feel sleepy which also triggers anxiety), therapy, etc.   
I really don't stress about finances, being alone with the kid and so on. What really bothers me is nausea because I keep falling into this fucking loop of:

Emetophobia -&gt; anxiety -&gt; nausea -&gt; repeat

It took me 3 years to finally come to the conclusion that emetophobia is the cause of my severe anxiety. It's on my mind 24/7. Slightest sound or sensation in my abdomen triggers an attack, even though my mind is rational and I KNOW it's nothing. But it triggers a chain reaction which in turn makes me super nauseous and drained.

If anyone can help me out, I will be eternally grateful because my quality of life has been reduced to dragging miserably through days. One day I'll be okay, but I'm panicking for the next three.   
Thanks in advance and stay safe!

Scared of rabies from potential dog scratch two years ago,"Odds are no one is going to see this, but god I need to vent.

So, about two years ago, I was on a run, and I encountered a bunch of dogs. The dogs were under the shade of some object, and I saw them too late. (English isn't my native language, and I am not quite sure what the term for the ""object"" would be).

Anyways, I made a run for it, the dogs chased me and got to me. Now here's where I'm not sure what exactly happened due to adrenaline and panic ... I remember one of the dogs basically bunting my back/butt, and I fell down (leaving cuts on my knees, elbows and hands). I don't think there was a scratch, but fuck my memory is fuzzy. I am pretty sure there wasn't a bite, as I think I would remember that.  I also don't know what happened to the dog...

I went to a doctor to get the wounds cleaned up and told him what I remembered, but he was dismissive and said I would be fine (which to his credit, I am). For some reason, I'm still scared, especially after reading cases which have shown of rabies resurfacing after 4 years, or 8 years or 20 years or so forth.

But I do have many times when my anxiety will peak and I will hyperventilate, perspire and have heart palpitations (my primary symptoms in my anxiety experience). I heard panic attacks are much more intense and have no particular triggers... as compared to my OCD which is pretty much in the background all/most of the time...",SlipInternational593,1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6i91k/anxiety_attack_v_panic_attack/
Anxiety about speech issues making them worse,"I really don’t speak that poorly but I notice a couple really small issues with how I speak.

Another is whenever I make an M sound followed by a K or G sound (example: I’m going), my lips pop. You know how you pull your lips in and blow to make a pop sound? That’s what happened with mine.

Support groups can make me feel worse,"My gosh, I tried this online support group for depression anxiety. I shared a painful experience with my abusive mother. Lots of helpful people, but all it took was one tough love statement about “well, we’re adults now and your mom had a mental illness. Feel compassion for her!” For me to just break and cry. And then all of my problems just rose to the surface. My new health issues caused by a seizure, the false rumors that where spread about me, the job that keeps me so isolated from everyone that they literally forget about me.

What's the best SSRI (or other medication) for anxiety/OCD that doesn't have bad side effects?,"Is there an SSRI (or other medication) that calms anxiety and stops you from feeling uneasy and mentally fragile from things that happen in your life and from ruminating too much?

I understand that everyone's different etc but I'm wondering if there are ones that have been proven to do the job better than others, without giving side effects like erectile dysfunction, lack of sex drive, or taking away the natural vibrant part of your personality if that makes sense.

I've come out of an emotionally/psychologically abusive situation 6 months ago that's made me even more anxious about everything. I've thought for a long time to avoid SSRIs but after what's happened my emotions are just always so raw and on a rollercoaster, I just need relief as it's horrible. I need something to block it out.

I keep getting headaches from cognitive dissonance and I'm affected by everything and feel so bad from having no certainty/closure in even little things that don't even matter. Like I wasn't sure if I ate cereal yesterday morning and I was panicking so much due to the uncertainty of not remembering and not fully knowing my perception of events.

My OCD is affecting me a lot and I'm getting obsessed with lots of things like what I've just stated plus other stuff, like people being passive-aggressive IRL which is massively triggering for me and affects me badly as that's how abusive friend was a lot of the time, not knowing what was happening or what he was thinking etc.

Someone who I barely know was passive-aggressive to me and gave me something like the silent treatment because I said the wrong thing due to social anxiety and that's giving me headaches and making me feel physically ill and uneasy. I'm so affected by how other people treat me or think about me, I just need it to stop and need relief.

Thanks for any suggestions.",ParadiseCity22,1,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6hu2g/whats_the_best_ssri_or_other_medication_for/
How do I describe anxiety?,"Just before I start I would like to say my Mam knows about my anxiety.

So yesterday I got so overwhelmed and was having a panic attack in school. The stupid teacher decided to tell my mam. Once I got home she kept bugging me to tell me what's wrong. I told her that it was kinda chained up inside me. After a while, I finally told her. This is what I said-

'I keep really badly criticizing myself over and over and I can't stop the thoughts!' 

Stupid me worded it wrong, as expected I got yelled at. She said I needed to toughen up bla bla bla.

She said I needed to calm down, relax. And then started comparing my problems to hers.

Caffeine Withdrawal vs GAD,"So, I recently had a full on panick attack (the day I decided to stop drinking caffeine) which led me to believe I was going to die soon in the most painful of ways. I have been suffering for almost 4 days and even refusing to take anxiety medication because of the side effect. Tuesday night was my breaking point for feeling like shit, and was determine to overcome this without medication. Yesterday was a struggle but was able to keep my anxiety attack to a tolerable level. Today is better, I still feel anxious but at a mild level. For some odd reason I decided to look up caffeine Withdrawal symptoms, and anxiety is one of them.

So my question is how can one tell if its anxiety by nature or Withdrawal from caffeine?

Limbo anxiety depression limbo anxiety repeat,"I don't even know where to start this or why I am even writing this. Excuse the predicted typos and grammatical errors I am typing this at 2 am drunk. I semi apologize in advance for how stupid this all might sound but i am genuinely fucking HURT. I am just lost as - as you know what. Well let's start with 2019- Literally the best year of my life, I had a nice group of friends, i was always going out, i lost a bunch of weight , i was happy, healthy and thriving. It seemed like everyday got better and it did, i ended up meeting my now fiance on a vacation in southern France ( a vacation i worked my ass off for a whole year working min wage to go to) 3 days after coming back in August I landed an amazing job with Chanel ( Literally do not know how i managed that ) &amp; I got accepted to university the same day as getting the new job- me and my dysfunctional ass family were finally good for once i literally had it the fuck all. (i was freshly 19 at the time). I don't know where it all went wrong, i literally do not. It came crumbling fast. The Chanel job was AMAZING, i was surrounded by new social people everyday, I made a bunch of new friends that were my age, everyday was a surprise, something to look forward to- It was the first job I was wholeheartedly was happy about and exited to go to. School started off pretty good too, i was just thriving - best i have ever been in life ( I put that on everything i love) My boss was really type B (type B on crack) she had a son my age and she started out very warm and motherly the first month but then became a micro managing, breathing down your neck, judgmental , always side eyeing YKW. She would always pick on the little things ( me not wearing enough makeup, one strand of hair being out of place, even saw a MAC lipstick in my pouch and shook her head at me) I honestly think in the beginning she was trying to help me, help me succeed with the brand , help me match the image of the company i was working for, etc. I did some stupid shit in the start of my working there, I was fresh back from a 2 month long vacation, newly in love, I was just high on life. The vacation me did not wear off, i was always smiley and chatty , texting my fiance constantly when i shouldn't, etc etc. When she had a conversation with me about that i did a complete 180 and snapped back into reality asap, i was no longer on my phone on the floor, i stayed in my section at all times, i was always on time, my sales were THROUGH THE ROOF, every single day, i was always booking appointments until max capacity, had a clientele within 2 months of working there , made 8 close close friend, the place felt like home, it was my home and safe space. Then January of 2020 things began to fall apart, i was working overtime at Chanel and couldn't keep up with school and ended up withdrawing from school, then my best friend and i ended up having a nasty nasty fight which almost got physical and we stopped being friends and did not talk ( Until now but it's not the same at all) , my boss became passive aggressive towards me, would almost ignore me and i felt uncomfortable af, my District boss was getting multiple multiple ""client complaints about me"" about things that NEVER EVER happened, i genuinely think my boss was filing them anonymously or having her friends do it because i swear on my life that i poured my heart out and gave it my all when it came to the actual work and clients, I ended up being fired the last day of January for another ""customer complaint"" a fake fucking customer complaint. My boss had worked there 14+ years and had a lot of power and sway, i don;t know what i ever did to her. I admit i was immature and high on love and life at first but when she checked me on it i straightened up the same second. After being fired everything went downhill, covid quarantine started, I lost contact with most of my friends, i ended up being kicked out from my house , didn't re-enroll in school( still haven't), gained all the weight back and more, got diagnosed with an physical illness, got put on strong ati anxiety/depression meds that did not work, and did not work for a year exactly due to being in a state that was heavily impacted by Covid. I started working again 2 months ago and things are getting better i guess or though i thought so but i still feel so empty, i feel so lonely and depressed, i see a couple friends here and there but it doens't make a difference on how i feel, it just isn't the same, my fiance and i haven't seen each other in almost 2 years ( will be 2 years in August) because of Covid, I don't think I will be able to see him this summer in person either France is closed off. I am grateful to have a job and make money ( i was in bed crying everyday for a whole hear) but my new job is so fucking miserable, all i do is stare at a computer and everybody is 40 years older than me, every day is the same. Everyday is predictable. I miss my Chanel job so much, i miss having a best friend i would see all the time, i miss the excitement of the beginning of my relationship i miss my fiance flirting with me and being in awe over me ( we've been together a couple years now long distance and it feels like we've been married for 10 years) , i miss the happy beautiful me who had spark in her eyes, my eyes have no life in them now, i don't feel excited about anything, everyday is numb, i don't get pleasure from anything. Nothing to look forward to, even when i make plans i feel nothing, i feel like a part of me or all of me died this last year and a half. I miss the person i used to be i miss my life, I turn 21 this month and i just feel nothingness, is it really just downhill from here ? Am i crazy? What happened? I am back with my parents and i am happy to be around my siblings again, my parents and i's relationship was never good it was mostly abusive and it probably will never be good, i am going to restart school in the fall i hope but i dont know wtf i am going to do - i was planning law and fiance but that just seems like a dreadful career, good money yes but fucking boring. I love my fiance but i wish he would just man up sometimes and take some of the weight off my shoulders at time just like i do for him. I don't know anymore. I'm sorry for rambling i just want my life back, the old me back, my old job back. I am fucking dead inside. Is this just life. is this just adult hood and i am just stuck on the life i had at 18/19.

I want to change jobs but my anxiety is making me struggle,"I’m a security guard, it’s exactly as the title says, there’s other jobs I feel like I would be qualified for but I’m so scared of failing I don’t even try. Not to mention that I don’t even know where to start with resumes and cover letters and what if they want a video interview or even worse an in person interview and I have to dress nice. I started off loving my job, everything was fine, the pay was adequate for the job being done and I thought the company was great. It turns out the company is in fact not great and also had a very long USA Today article written about it and how it wasn’t so great but I was noticing things before the article came out. In my 4 years of working here I’ve only been given one raise and one bonus in the form of a $50 Amazon gift card. My boss is terrible. My fellow supervisors are also terrible, one of them has been letting another employee sleep on duty because she says he’s a good worker. There’s a literal hole in the floor where I work and we have it covered up with a piece of plywood but that was also getting a hole in it so we covered that up with a plastic cover but that also got holes so we had to cover the holes up with duct tape. 
I want to apply to be an Escrow assistant even though I have no experience the job listing says they’re willing to train and that would be a $4.50 an hour pay increase and I think I could get the job but it’s a mental battle with myself whether or not I should even apply.

i had my first anxiety attack this week thinking about how to talk to my ex who we started a sexual relationship with. i want to talk to her about where the relationship is going but i always have a small anxiety attack whenever i think about it. please i need help on how to talk about it with her,"i been in contact with my ex for about a month now but we been "" friends"" for 2 years but we messed around on again and off again during it. but ever since we started to talk again and well kinda start a sexual relationship to. ever since we had phone sex 2 times  its been starting to get in my head. i have all these anxious thoughts about what i am doing wrong, how can i be better. she knows i have anxiety and its caused us problems in our past before. but i am getting help ever since i was diagnosed with social anxiety and OCD about a year and a half ago.  

she told me that it meant something to her and that she does not do this with just anybody. so that made me feel a little better. but i always have had very strong feelings for this person ever since we dated. she was the first and so far only girl i have actually been in love with so far in my life. we are both 23 years old and she is a nurse so she is busy at nights but only works 3 days a week.  that is the background of well the whole situation. 

what i need help with is that i have all these anxieties building up in me and i wanted to talk to my therapist about it. but he canceled because he was sick. so that made me feel even worse.  like i actually had my first anxiety attack this week and it made me feel horrible. it's just everything with school, my friends and her my ex. i know i am a better person then i was in the past and she obviously sees that too. because she has been doing this with me for the last 2 weeks. i mean she even got jealous when she asked me about who i been with since we broken up. its been a long distance relationship. i know people say they don't work but i mean we still talk to each other a lot over the past 2 years.  so i mean that has to mean something right? 

i am just really nervous and extremely anxoius to talk to her about how i am feeling because she dose not like to talk about feelings. and i don't want to push her away either because of my anxiety. i just feel like there is something wrong with me, like i am doing something wrong and like when i think about what i want to ask her and tell her i begin to cry out of either anxiety or frustration with myself. because i fee like if i was just a little better things would be different. like i want to aks her about this relationship we have, the anxieties that i feel due to it, but i don't want to make it seem like its her fault or use this as an excuse because i hate using this as an excuse.  

its just this relationship means a lot to me and i really can see a future with her its just i am scared to go about it and talk to her about everything. it just makes me so anxious. like a sense of fear and dread almost when i think about how to talk to her about it. i just really wish i was normal and i could go about doing this without it getting to me like this.",trapasuoris_rex,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6h6ic/i_had_my_first_anxiety_attack_this_week_thinking/

What to do about near constant anxiety in a period of many new social inputs,"Weird title. So let me (19m, 124p, 5f 9.5in) explain. Whenever there’s something in my life that is related to a lot of risk or I’m just trying a bunch of new stuff in my life, I get anxious and it disturbs my life a lot. 

Fall of last year I met a girl and for two months my sleeping and eating was disturbed. When we got together and things seemed right my sleep cycle was easy to control and I didn’t feel awful everytime I had to eat.

She broke up shortly after and all the problems returned. Started a new job at that time and I felt awful for the first couple months. Couldn’t eat enough to feel strong and fresh. Just felt weak. Couldn’t eat lunch at work because I couldn’t fully relax. 

Things got better. But my job was a covid related job. So had to get a new job sooner or later. That kinda stressed me. And the eating problems came back a small bit. But nonetheless, I found a new job and had two weeks holiday in between which was really relaxing. 

Then, now, I started the new job. And there is so much stuff to learn (barista). I really enjoy it. It doesn’t stress me in the moment. Look forward to my next shift. And so on. But it’s just draining me so much. And as a beginner I have, of course, a lot of insecurities and such. And now I really feel my anxiety and eating problems coming back hard. 

My friends always kinda jokes that I can’t eat that much. But it’s never like I can’t eat. I’m super hungry. I just feel sick and loose appetite after a few bites. Or, like now, feel sick just thinking of food. 

But I have to eat. I’m already underweight. And not eating makes me so exhausted. I just can’t. And that makes me so sad and annoyed. Like, I feel helpless because I don’t know what to do. And I really hate feeling like this. And I just know it will get worse (or stay the same) for the next couple of weeks. I don’t know how to deal with it...

Could this be related to anxiety?,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had problems starting new tv shows/movies. I’ll delay watching them for as long as possible, or even never get round to watching/finishing them despite being interested in the plot/storyline. Also, whenever my friends/family want to watch a movie I am always the difficult person who doesn’t want to watch any of the suggestions other than something I’ve already watched because I feel more relaxed and less tense while watching it. Usually watching a new movie/show triggers a weird kind of panicky feeling where I feel really uncomfortable and it’s typically uncontrollable. When I was younger it got the point where I would argue with my siblings and get myself into tears when my siblings wanted to watch something that I knew I would enjoy but unexplainably couldn’t watch. It feels almost like there’s a blockage in my brain. I wish I could understand the origins of where this has come from but I don’t really understand it. I’ve suffered with (specifically social) anxiety for about 6 years now but I don’t really understand why it would be related this but I saw a video recently saying that watching things you’ve already watched and avoiding new shows/movies can be related to anxiety.

This was because I ended up having a conversation with a conspiracy theorist about the vaccine, pandemic, and how those and other things are connected.

After using sources provided to me by some really nice comments on my first thread, I did some more research on the vaccine and managed to debunk many of the conspiracies told to me. Having done so, I decided to stick to my original decision to get my first shot today!

It was still a little nerve racking because the anxiety the conspiracies gave me never went fully away, but I was able to power through it and get it! Thankfully the process of getting the vaccine happened fast enough to where my anxiety wouldn’t created any last-minute second thoughts.

How do I deal with people at work who criticise me just because it’s me?,"So I may be getting semi promoted at work and some other girls have too. I’m a 22 year old guy and in the exact same position as this other girl.

For some reason the light and attention of what I’ve done or haven’t done is always on me.

If someone else has made the exact same mistake as me; nothing gets said. But if it’s me, they have to shout about it to everyone but not in a respectful way where I can improve and be professional; it’s more of a manipulative swipe attempt at my reputation and credibility; which has been ridiculed and mocked since the first day I walked in 5 years ago. People just *don’t like me* for whatever reason. I literally do my job like everyone else. This is why I complain about physicality of looks playing a huge role in this sort of treatment. If I stand up for myself people think I’m some kind of asshole but if I don’t people walk all over me.

Some of the others also getting the job say “you need to do the work” as if I don’t? It’s like they make the same or *worse* mistakes than me; it doesn’t matter but as soon as I made a mistake it’s the end of the fucking universe.

It’s toxic and I’ve wanted to leave for a while. It’s been in the back of my mind for years now but the problem always has been that I kind of got the gold dust of positions for minimum wage and there’s not a lot better than that until you start progressing career wise. *which can take years*.

1 year of paresthesia !,"Hello everyone. 
So I have been dealing with major stress last year and since last summer I have been experimenting a lot of unexplained physical pain in my chest and lower back and anal pain too, and tingling/pins and needles sensations in my legs and feet, it's there almost tge whole time but it feels worse in some positions like when I'm laying down or exercising the tingling become very sharp. 
Went to the doctors +10 times but always the answer is the same, nothing is wrong, no vitamin deficiency or anything else either, it kept getting worse and worse until I started taking antidepressant five months ago (Cymbalta) 60mg then after two months all the physical pain is gone except the tingling, it's really driving me crazy and I can't ignore it especially the fact that it's been going for a long time, does anyone here have a similar experience?  And if yes did it go away eventually?  Thanks for reading and hope y'all a happy and healthy life :)",Arabian-Shwarma,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6fblj/1_year_of_paresthesia/
Reasonable adjustments for job interviews in the UK?,"Hi guys, 

During the job application process, I would always enclose that I have a 'long-term mental health condition.' Usually, there's no option to expand on this.

What do you ask for in terms of reasonable adjustments at the interview? I would really love to ask for the questions beforehand but I'm not quite sure if this is allowed.

I've been on the job hunt for four months feeling really down and just going through motions and feeling numb. I don't know if it's self-sabotage, lack of confidence/impostor syndrome or what but I always mess up on the finish line.

Today, I received a 'no' from a big firm two weeks after my final interview. I have two interviews next week so really hoping I get my shit together.

Debilitating panic attacks.,"About once a day or so, sometimes more I will go into a state of sheer panic. My throat gets super tight, my limbs tingle and my chest hurts. I’m terrified that my throat will close, which I think stems from some trauma that I have from having gone through anaphylaxis before (bad peanut allergy). As soon as the thought comes up, it’s like a runaway train and no amount of box breathing, distraction or anything else seems to work. I have been taking Benadryl to try to calm myself down, as that used to help me when I had similar but less intense anxiety. It isn’t really working though and I just sit there terrified waiting for either death or for the feeling to go away. My therapist (not a psychiatrist) suggested that I try to get a Xanax script, but I have never been on anything that strong before and I’m not sure how I would go about doing that. I have insurance through my mom (I am 23M). Any suggestions that people might have would be very welcome. This is starting to control my days, and it’s strange because I felt like I was finally starting to work through some of my addictions and depression before the anxiety started.",Memesaretheorems,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6f1ny/debilitating_panic_attacks/

Roommate moving out,"My roommate is moving out after 5 years. When I'm in this apartment alone I think I won't be able to cope without her here. I need extra life in this place. I'm meeting strangers from craigslist but they're strangers...they're not my best friend. I just..when she's not here and I'm alone in the apartment I just feel like..like without her around I'll be trapped here, I won't leave. I won't get ready. I won't be motivated.

I've been posting all morning, crying some. I treat it like journaling...I don't know, it makes me not feel so alone. I haven't eaten or showered or dressed. I made my bed at least but fuck. I'm so scared. It's happening in one month and I don't know what I'm going to do to survive it. If I find a good person to move in, that'll help. Just having different energy around the house... but I just feel terrified.

She works in the morning and I don't work til noon so every morning I get a taste of what it'll be. Kind of. She still hugs me bye and sometimes brings me coffee or something but like...I wake up and cry and journal/post on reddit and try to feel out the feelings a bit. And I try to cope with the loneliness by reaching out to people, keeping my schedule pretty busy. I don't have a very robust social life so that's challenging but I joined Bumble BFF and met some people that now I guess I have people to go do things with..

I'm trying, but a moment ago I got up and walked in the other room and immediately felt like when she leaves things will get so rough for me mentally and I'll feel so suicidal.

This isn't the only source of stress in my life at the moment - our dog and my dad died 5 months ago and the grief is part of why she's leaving. My grief has triggered some serious abandonment issues and she couldn't deal. She needed space to grieve but when she took it I would panic internally and she couldn't be around it.

My feelings are so big. I guess I can't worry about what will happen in a month. I can only take it day by day. I loved living together but we grew too close, codependent, and I know I stopped some personal growth emotionally because I could count on her to help. Now I'm being dropped and I'm really struggling to manage my feelings on my own.

How do you deal with anxiety when it flares up?,"Hi everyone glad I found this forum. So a little about myself I am a 31-year-old male that has been dealing with in anxiety  for a couple years now. My anxiety is mostly focused on hypochondria. I would be good for a while and then I would have random flareups if I have a symptom or something along those lines. For example I was doing yardwork the other day and I think I may have gotten bitten by a bug. My fiancé looked at that little mark on the back of my neck and said that there is no bite marks it isn’t raised or inflamed it just looks like a little rash. I feel a normal person would put some Cortizone cream on it and see how it goes since I didn’t even know there was a mark there since it was in itching or anything. Instead I jumped to the conclusion that I got bit by something bad and that I’m going to get sick and I should go to urgent care. 

Seems like random events in my life flare things up and I will on things like for another example I went out for a few beers and a burger for my engagement and felt nauseous and upset to my stomach later on that night I automatically thought I had stomach cancer or something along those lines.

So I guess my question is what have all of you found helpful to help deal with flareups like these? What have you done to help not dwell on symptoms and try and move on with your life?

"After 5 years of suffering, I’m finally going to try anxiety medication, and I have anxiety about taking the meds","First time posting here, so my apologies if I’m doing anything incorrectly! TL;DR is essentially what the title says ^ 

I (25f) have dealt with what I now know to be anxiety since college, but for years I didn’t put two and two together. I tried therapy a couple different times but it never seemed to do much. It never crossed my mind that I might actually have a condition that requires medication. Well, after weeks of having daily panic attacks over extremely minor things, I finally admitted to myself that I need to try medication or I won’t have anyone left in my life to help me through those episodes. I went to the doctor, and got a 5mg lexapro prescription to start, with the goal of increasing it to 10. But here’s the problem... I’m really anxious about taking it for the first time. I have bad nausea problems already (likely partially due to my anxiety) and I’m worried this will make it worse. I’m also really really scared to become dependent on it, and then if I ever go off of it I won’t be able to function in the world. To be fair, I’m barely functioning now, but because it’s all I know, I’m able to do it. I am so so so scared that once I’m on it, I won’t be able to live without it. Did anyone else experience these feelings when you first started taking medication for your anxiety? How did you move past it?

Sense of Self Outside of Anxiety?,"I just wanted to know if anyone else have felt that fear of not knowing who you will become after you learn to manage your anxiety. If so, how have you overcome it? 

Recently I have realized that many things that I attributed to just being a part of my personality had a lot to do with anxiety. I’ve struggled with it for most of my life (I’m 23F now and the earliest I can remember dealing with anxiety is when I was in elementary school) and I thought I knew the difference between things my anxiety caused and things I just didn’t want to do because of my personality. Now looking back I realize just how much I’ve been held back by this. I want to start changing myself, but now a new worry has entered my head: who am I outside of my anxiety?

How to stop being idealistic and overthinking? Mothers day anguish looming.,"I (39f) have 2 kids (7&amp;5) from previous relationship and my bf (38m) has 1 daughter who's 3. We've been together 2.5 years so I've known her since she was a baby and am very close with her.  We have a great bond. She absolutely adores me and it's become a bit of an inside joke when I'm around that dads invisible as she always wants me to do everything like get her dressed, put her to bed,  read stories etc if we're in a restaurant it always has to be me that takes her to the toilet.  it's very cute (and tiring haha).
I spend 2-3 nights a week at his place every week when I don't have my kids .

Tonight his daughter was showing me the presents they got for her mum. Lots if stuff, a foot spa , candles , a book , chocolates and a card. I instantly felt my anxiety rising. But its stupid because I appreciate that he's like that . If he didn't get her gifts on mother's day I'd find it weird.

But it got me thinking about my relationship with his daughter, I know he must appreciate the bond we have and he has said in the past that im good with her . But I had this thought pop into my head that he might do something for me on mother's day as we will be waking up together on that day with no kids (my kids get dropped off later in the day). I'm not expecting expensive gifts or anything, I just had this passing thought that he might acknowledge the effort I go to with his daughter.

But the problem I have is once the thought enters my brain it stays there like it's cemented in. And now I can't stop thinking about it. Its like an unwanted intrusive thought. This post isn't so much about wanting validation about being worthy of a step parent gift or gesture but more about wanting to stop being idealistic about situations?
I'm 90% sure he won't have organised anything at the most he will roll over in bed on the morning and say happy mother's day. And I'm afraid because of the way my brain latches onto these things I'm going to go straight into fight or flight mode. I'm fairly certain I'm going to be triggered . I'll either cry in bed right next to him or I'll act weird and distant until he leaves and burst into tears later until my kids arrive. Then my stupid anxious brain will probably start sending him messages and it will end up out of control.

So sick of rabies anxiety. I don't know what to do.,"15M. Country: Georgia.

Everything started about 1.5 months ago when my puppy bit me. I didn't get rabies from her because she is still alive an well. But after what I have read about rabies, completely destroyed my life.

Everytime I touch something, my mind keeps telling me that I will somehow get rabies. If I touch something, I immediately wash my hands. I even avoid touching my family members. My hands are irritated and dry from washing them frequently. 

About 25 days ago I noticed 3 dots on tip of my finger with very very short distance between them(1mm), thinking that bat bit me without me noticing. I still have these dots. I know it is so rare but I can't get rid of that kind of thoughts. I also have never seen a bat in my entire life.

I also have fear of getting rabies from stray cats in my backyard without them biting me. 3 days ago I left a water bottle outside and after drinking from it the first thing that came to my mind was that what if a rabid cat licked it and then it got into my cuts on my lips(I always have chapped lips).

Yesterday my neighbor's dog attacked my puppy. The dog is usually put on a leash and lives outsiders but my neighbor released him yesterday. The dog came into my backyard aggressively and chased my puppy. The dog couldn't manage to bite her but I am worried if the dog's saliva got on my puppy's fur and then I petted her with my irritated hands? 

My life has never been like this before. When I tell my family members about this, they say I am going to be okay and sometimes laugh at me. Getting rabies is worst fear of mine. My mom doesn't take me to a doctor thinking that I will be okay. I don't know what to do anymore. I am crying inside.

A small writing on my relationship with anxiety,"I’d been walking on a ship for the past two weeks, a skipper that navigated rough, depthless oceans where unseasoned passengers spent days bending over the side railings letting themselves bring up what needed to come up. I was one of those passengers in the sea of my dizziness and on a good number of days a phantasmagoric mist would radiate off the water’s surface, shrouding my vision beyond the ships edge. All I could look out into was a gray void in which faces of loved ones and friends would sometimes materialize for a brief moment before disintegrating into the expanse. I would sometimes be sick in my despondency and isolation, sick with fear which sent me rolling in my sheets in a half wakeful delirium where the moment stretched eternally in both directions, consuming my whole past and future in that instant. Usually upon waking the hard grip of all these things would have slipped and gave way to a fading red claw mark, that healed quickly under the morning sun and welcome events of the day. But for the past two weeks I’d wake after a night of these torments and find that the scaly claw of anxiety, fear, panic, dizziness, and brain fog was still clutching my arm and sometimes I’d trace my eyes along the length of that claw to the arm on which it turned and saw something a bit more hideous and grotesque. Every once in a while I’d even continue looking up till my gaze met the nightmarish many faced head of that creature. Once in a blue moon I gently kiss that monster on the cheek and hold it tight in my embrace.",countofsaintyves,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6ccs7/a_small_writing_on_my_relationship_with_anxiety/

should I take the summer off to better my mental health?,"Hey everyone. Ive been going through a really rough 3 months with some severe depression and anxiety, especially depression. I have had MDD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years. Both of which are really bad. I took off the fall semester from school hoping I would get better and just worked, and then planned to return to school for the winter term. I tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that I unrolled from all of my classes, quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents. 

We thought things would have gotten better by now, but they’re only seeming to get worse. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high where I can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy. I feel like I can cry for hours which never used to happen. My anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with Xanax until my antidepressants start helping. 

So far in my life I’ve been on 8 different antidepressants and none have worked very well. I have just come off of Lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell. Now I’ve started taking both Wellbutrin and Sertraline, which I’m trying for a second time. 

I’m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy, I was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two, so I’m now talking to her twice a week. 

I’m having a really hard time if I should work this summer, so from when lockdown ends until end of August when I’ll move back to school. Or if I should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better. I have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me. So the money aspect isn’t a huge issue. The only part I’m struggling with is at the current summer job I have, I’m guaranteed full-time hours this year and get 3 days doing the job that pays the most in tips, and I’m concerned that if I take a year off I won’t get that next year. I’m just having a really difficult time deciding. 

I also do feel suicidal every day but not to the point where I figure out a plan to do it, more just wishing it was something I was brave enough to do &amp; then hating myself for having those thoughts. 

Any advice would help, thank you.",c4tluvrrr666,8,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n60not/should_i_take_the_summer_off_to_better_my_mental/
Sick stomach feeling,"Hey, everyone!

I’m currently going trough therapy and I’m struggling hard with mental health now. I suffer from intrusive thoughts, obsessive, they don’t leave my mind. They could be about a thing from my everyday life like a mistake that will replay 24/7 or dark, disturbing thoughts. And i worry constantly. Since i started going to therapy I feel much better, many things and traumas from my life came to the surface.


However, since yesterday I have been feeling this horrible, tie knot in my stomach. It makes me sick, it causes me pain and even sorry for saying but it caused me diarrhea, it’s that hardcore. But I won’t be seeing my therapist until next week, and I don’t want to call her, because I already did a few days ago to see her earlier than scheduled, and I don’t want to become dependent on her for every little thing. 

Anyways, the main trigger was a date that I arranged with a guy that I’m seeing. Since we arranged the date, this sick feeling appeared. But I have also so many thing happening in my life like the mental health, stressful job. I don’t know what’s the trigger exactly?! 

How do you deal with this? Please, tell me!

When I am busy and into my things it stops.. But when i’m watching a movie, or laying down, it’s driving me crazy! And most importantly because I can’t find the reason.... 

Anyone, please if you know how to find the reason  through a technique or how to relax for a bit, I will be very thankful for the advice.

Switching from Zoloft/Abilify,"Was diagnosed with depressive disorder, GAD, and PTSD after my son died back in September. Doc put me on Zoloft 50mg and slowly went up to 150 after a few months. Never really noticed too much of a benefit being on it. Did nothing for my anxiety. Started seeing a psychiatrist a few months back and she put me on abilify 5mg to take with the Zoloft and it made me feel like an absolute zombie and also made my anxiety worse. I have since stopped the abilify and went down to 100 Zoloft. I have an appt next week with my psych and want to discuss a medication change.
Has anyone had a similar experience and have you had success switching to another combo? I have a script for Xanax as well but I don’t like taking it if I don’t have to. I’ve heard good things about Effexor.

Serious FOMO/fear of losing friends,"So I (23M) have not been diagnosed with anything but this past few weeks I've been having some really bad anxiety. Every now and again I have really low points and constantly overthink, become incredibly self-conscious etc and I'm in one of those low points now. Recently it's mainly been around social situations and constantly feeling like people I work with and who I am great friends with don't like me.

Anyway I am just beginning to get past all this but one thing still lingers. I have an assessment thing at work in a month, and I am on the rota to be working that day anyway. However, the others that are doing this assessment are not on the rota so get a day off after the assessment. These are also the people I consider close friends. They have decided to go out for drinks after which usually wouldn't bother me, I would be a bit envious but would move on. However, this time after being told they were going out after I felt sick and almost wanted to cry out of the anxiety that I am not wanted, or I am being pushed out of this friend group. I know this is ridiculous but no matter how much I tell myself this I still have really bad FOMO and my mind wanders to thinking that I am going to be ditched as a friend.

To make things worse I can't stop overthinking the situation and coming up with scenarios that this was all done on purpose, I am annoying them, they actually don't like me etc.

Has anyone got any tips for getting past this? I am really trying not to let my anxiety show at work and influence my decisions but sometimes it can be really hard. I am close to tears now just thinking of losing great friends and being alone.",supersoftmattefinish,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n6a13c/serious_fomofear_of_losing_friends/
I have a tendency to over explain.,"Just to keep it brief.

I have GAD and I struggle to differentiate between my anxiety and reasonable consideration. I don’t know whether I’m just being cautious and thinking about things that maybe should be thought of more often, or if I’m over thinking things.

I sometimes find myself rambling a bit too much trying to explain my thoughts and actions, or if I’m giving directions to another, but I fear that it could come across condescending. I just feel like I have the responsibility to make sure others have all the information and if I haven’t provided them adequate information and they end up doing the wrong thing, it’ll be because I’ve failed to give them the right information. 

How do I stop doing this? I’m not intentionally meaning to be rude or anything but it could come across rude as I’m making the assumption that I need to spell it out to others. I have tried to pull back on this and be more aware of my tendency to over explain but then I feel like I’m being blasé and giving shit information. Is there ever a happy medium with anxiety? Why is it always two sides of the coin.",anonpumpkinpie,9,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5yuhl/i_have_a_tendency_to_over_explain/

Sure, I try to exercise daily, get as much sleep as possible, and eat healthy food on top of drinking a lot of water, so it’s probably a combination of all these things, but I find that whenever I start feeling a little anxious, I drink a few big sips of water and try to, breathe, calm myself down, and I think it helps.

I feel defeated and frustrated, like no matter what I do this won’t stop. And the embarrassment and guilt. The hospital had better things to do. I have better things to do. My family shouldn’t have to sit in the waiting room. My kids should be in bed. My boyfriend didn’t sign up for any of this, and I don’t want him to think less of me.

Mirtazapine 15mg and CBD?,"Hey guys, just wanted to get a better understanding of these two and how they interact with each other, if they do.

I've been on 15mg mirtazapine for a couple of months, doctor suggested going up to 30mg, did that for two weeks, worst two weeks of my life, now I've been back on the 15mg for the past three weeks, feeling better than I was on the 30mg but still incredibly anxious and having some bad panic attacks.

Lots of people suggested CBD, and I used to smoke a heap of weed during my early twenties and never really suffered from anxiety until I stopped, so it's intriguing me that it could be a potential help to ease the anxiousness.

But I just want to know if I can take one whilst also taking the other, for example I take mirtazapine before bed, could I take the CBD capsule during the day? Everywhere I look I'm seeing mixed answers, some people say it's absolutely fine, some people say it messes with your liver, some people say it can give you a heart attack, does anyone have a concrete answer on the two, anyone on here take both and is fine?

I really want to try the CBD cos the mirtazapine has caused me nothing but shit since I started taking it, I'm trying to withdraw but I just want to know if I can take them both together and it just seems there's all kinds of opinions.",Mac_Backwardz,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n698hb/mirtazapine_15mg_and_cbd/

Basically I have generalized anxiety disorder which we been knew but i’ve been struggling with a new trigger for the past year (ish).

How do I help my girlfriend manage her anxiety?,"My(33M) wonderful girlfriend(32F) gets anxious and stressed often and I would like advice or resources to help her or to help me help her overcome it, please.

Her biggest stressors are people in semi-official or authoritative positions- DMV, doctors, mechanics, veterinary receptionists even. She gets trapped focusing on the myriad of ways an interaction could go wrong, “what if they don’t like me”, “what if they yell at me”, “what if I say something stupid”. If she has time to think about the interaction beforehand she sinks.

But she is also a badass. Wildland Firefighter, Park Ranger, ass-kicker lay-down-the-law when some does something stupid in her park. If she doesn’t have a chance to wallow in hypotheticals, she’s incredible. She’s unstoppable in a crisis that needs a trained, instinctive response, or when helping someone else.

A current example that prompts me to write this: Our dog needs to go to the vet to get a routine heart-worm/flea/tick pill prescription. No procedure, no surgery, no commitment to this vet at all. We just need to get a prescription. She’s stressed and scared and all worked up over picking the right vet, calling to make the appointment, bringing the dog in. “What if I do it wrong?”. 
This is where my dilemma comes in: I want to be supportive and help her, but I also don’t want to enable this spiral into a paralyzing anxiety by simply doing everything for her: I can’t just be her crutch while she hides under a blanket(sometimes literally). Where is the middle ground? I feel a bit frustrated by her wallowing in the stress of what seems to me a preposterously simple task and my impulse is to give her a bit of tough love here. On the other hand, this anxiety is real to her, so I have to be understanding of that.

r/anxiety, what do?

Oh, food definitely plays a part. She’s much more capable of she’s eaten well recently. Hungry girl is stress girl, fair enough. But when that mood kicks in I can’t get her to eat anything, or if she does it’s junk food. Food- cheese, carbs, chocolate- is a huge crutch and comfort item when she’s stressed.",1971CB350,2,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n633pe/how_do_i_help_my_girlfriend_manage_her_anxiety/
Thanks for nothing,"TW: suicide. 

I'm so fucking tired. 
I've been trying to get help through the health care system in the country I live (not US), and today I went to an appointment that they booked for me, to get help with anxiety.
It wasn't a psychologist though, which I would've wanted to talk to, more like a counsellor type person. 
Anyway, I thought I give it a try anyway, if it's not the right fit maybe they can refer me to a psychologist?
(I can't afford to pay for a private psychologist.)

Well, no. While I've been thinking about how nice it would be to just be gone forever, the person gave me some advice on an mindfulness app. 

I feel like this appointment now makes me feel even more like shit. If the healthcare provider doesn't take it seriously, who will? 

And no, I didn't talk to the person about these thoughts, because it felt stupid and ridiculous to sit there and tell her about how bad I feel when she doesn't seem to understand what the problem is at all. She basically interrupted me when I answered her questions too.

how i deal with my negative thoughts,"hii! this is my first post on reddit so i hope i'm doing this right .. i recently got on this app because i started experiencing symptoms of anxiety, and a lot of negative thoughts more frequently than usual. and i'm glad i found this community as it makes me feel less alone :-)

i'm not a professional, but i've always been determined to experiment with different ways to cope with my anxiety and deal with my negative thoughts. so i just wanted to share a tip that works for me, in hopes that someone out there will find it useful too!

-

🌻 THE TIP: Keeping a Notebook of Positive Affirmations
[ things needed: notebook + pen ]

-&gt; whenever you think of a negative thought, pause; take deep breaths. try to think of an affirmation that you wished someone would assure you with, or one that would help calm you down.

-&gt; then, write down that affirmation in your notebook. you can type it out in your phone, but i highly recommend having a physical book! i'm a student, and i often get sudden negative thoughts throughout my day. we're not allowed to use our phones during lessons so this is where my notebook serves as a ""first-aid kit"". it's easy to reach out for my notebook any time i'd like - so whenever i think of an affirmation to counter my negative thoughts, i can conveniently write it down.

-&gt; if it's too difficult to come up with an affirmation on your own, feel free to surf the net for positive daily reminders/uplifting quotes! you need not write it down word-for-word, you may always rephrase them to suit your situation :-)

-&gt; however, i personally found that coming up with my own affirmations was much more effective for me, as some quotes feel very cliche .. &gt;&lt;"" which is why i found that my own affirmations were more relatable to my own life ^^~

-

i understand that it may get really difficult to think of the positive side of things to counter your negative thoughts, especially when things get really tough. hence, this tip may not be helpful for some. however, i hope that everyone will hang in there. not all things will be easy, but not all things will be difficult - you're going to be okay! i'm rooting for you :-)",miko0q,2,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n62w0l/how_i_deal_with_my_negative_thoughts/

"Journaling has helped me with anxiety. My most recent entry- “My anxiety is exactly the same thing as what it is not, all the time. “","My anxiety is exactly the same thing as what it is not, all the time. 

My anxiety is selfish. Trust me, I know the way it likes to make things about itself. Trust me, it told me so. I know the way it likes to slip this way and that, the way it slumbers all the time while it oozes into dinner conversation and shifts the mood. I’m already thinking up the apology text I’ll send you later. At the same time, I already know I won’t read your response. I’ll tell you I was tired. I was stressed and stretched thin, more than I realized. I didn’t mean to be so negative and self-absorbed. 

Even though you didn’t think I was listening, I’ll tell you my thoughts on everything you were saying. I know I am not the only person with a lot on their plate. I’m sorry if it seems like I already had my fill, I just haven’t eaten in days. And I’m hungry and scared and I’m grasping at empty air most times so when I see you I am desperate for any scrap of normalcy I can get. “Please please please hear me out and let me relate and let me try to process anyone’s problems but my own. Mine are too big and I am too small. And I can only process so much. But I’m drowning your thoughts in my own while mine are already drowned by me swallowing yours.”

But I don’t really say that. I’m smiling, asking about your new job (and praying you don’t think it’s weird I said new when I know you started 6 months ago and now I’m sweating you might believe I’ve been neglecting you for just now asking). “Oh, glad you like it! These potatoes are great! Can you pass the gravy?”

Deep breath. Forget about that, it was nothing. 

That’s when my anxiety makes my stomach hurt with self-imposed guilt and distorted memories that are the wrong color. Memories that I share with others, only mine come with annotated, highlighted split-moments of me fiercely blushing, moments that others have long forgot. That’s when my anxiety likes to remind me that maybe, and I emphasize maybe, they remember.

My selfish anxiety is the sound of my ringtone. The notification of another missed call and an unheard voicemail. Every time it rings and bings and dings it somehow gets louder and harder to ignore. It’s the same sound of my heartbeat. Can everyone hear that too?

Missed spam calls bringing me missed voicemails so now I’m missing them all. And it’s all because I’m anxious about what I missed. Talk about the ultimate FOMO. 
 
It’s funny though. I don’t think I’m selfish. I overthink and I oversleep or don’t ever sleep but it’s not because it’s in my best interest. I’ll find myself in any horoscope you say is mine. I’ll even give you a good reason why. My anxiety disrupts my daydreams.

My anxiety is selfish but I am not. It tries to take myself and make it about itself. Not me.",justanotherliz,4,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5xkjb/journaling_has_helped_me_with_anxiety_my_most/

Is this a part of my anxiety? Because it's actually debilitating.,"First time poster - hopefully I did this right. 

My anxiety has steadily gotten worse over the years, but one thing that I've always ignored as a part of my anxiety is freezing (for lack of a better word). Using a recent example, I was editing a photograph to post on my photography Instagram, and my friend suggested dodging the hair to accentuate the highlights. 

Often when I try a new thing like this, I wont even be capable of learning it properly. In this instance, it was something simple, but I felt a tightness in my chest and I couldn't comprehend how to do it, let alone even try. My brain screams *""I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it!""* and I am so debilitated I cant even attempt the thing I'm doing. Drawing, photography, any skill where imposter syndrome can take its hold, or even new mechanics in games with friends sometimes. My brain wont even let me try to learn what I'm trying to learn, it just screams ""I don't get it"" and shuts down.

Has anybody experienced something like this?",Mt105,8,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5vbak/is_this_a_part_of_my_anxiety_because_its_actually/

Shortness of Breath,"Hi friends,

I was wondering if anyone else suffers from shortness of breath when it comes to anxiety. Usually, it happens at night for me but it's now happening all day and causing my chest to feel heavy.

I'm not letting my worry think this is some other kind of condition because I saw my doctor yesterday and listed my symptoms. They didn't seem too concerned so I won't be either (this is very hard, but I can manage).

Why?? Why does this keep happening??,"Man, I get random bouts of extreme anxiety all the time for no reason. Like, I'm just trying to have a good time - I'm watching old anime, browsing online for information about the movies I might have missed watching as a kid, thinking about working on a piece of art.. and *bam*! Out of nowhere, just the worst feeling - my stomach is in knots, my heart is racing, I feel nauseous and jittery.

So I stop doing everything, and just sit there focusing on my breathing. Eventually, the anxiety calms down and we're back at lowtide. Just the usual, quiet buzzing of nerves in the back of my head. So, I think - ""Okay, we should be good. I should be able to look at art, or start on that sketch I've been putting off,"" when **boom**! *Again*! So I think, ""Alright, maybe no artwork. Maybe art is stressing me out."" So I put that idea aside for a moment, and just start browsing online and then it happens again! I have opened a single tab and there is nothing in the tab, but for some reason I am now severely anxious again.

Alright, alright. Maybe I should relax, right? Maybe it's browsing the internet late at night that's stressing me out. Maybe it's seeing the computer screen, or something. Never mind that generally speaking, I enjoy being awake alone at night, working on one kind of project or another. I guess today, my body just can't stand the internet. So, I look out into my room (a clean room, since I finished cleaning only an hour or so ago)... and it hits me again. 

It's like today, my body just doesn't want me to be happy. I'm not in a bad mood, I haven't looked at *anything* stressful, I've been *trying* to relax, but my body will just **not work with me.** My whole life, people have told me ""it's all in the way you think, Iyo!"" ""It's just a matter of regulating your emotions and your habits, Iyo!"" ""Just drink more water, Iyo!"" All of which is perfectly valid, but is apparently completely useless when it comes to this specific kind of situation. 

Comfy? **Check**. Hydrated? **Double check**. Did I eat well today? I tried to eat healthy, so.. *I think so?* Did I sleep? I actually *overslept*! I even tried to move around a little, set up for my workout routine for when the sun rises, lit some candles, put on a cute outfit.. nothing. It's just not working. I'm perfectly content with what I'm doing right now, but my body - my heart, my stomach, my hands - they're pounding, twisting, shaking.

 This happens so often, I can barely do anything I enjoy. I struggle with going on walks, talking with friends, painting, reading, writing, watching anime, gaming - literally everything I enjoy doing seems to freak me out. It's driving me up a wall, and then back down again!

Usually it’s the center of my eyelashes, my eyebrows, and in certain parts of my scalp which has caused my hair to be way thinner. it throbs unless I pull out my hair and I try not to and be conscious of it but no matter what that doesn’t help because it hurts unless I pull it out. and the worst part is i know i’m just making myself look worse but that’s how much the sensation takes over.

I have been struggling with anxiety for a couple years now (i'm 14) and its become so stressful, I'm always avoiding conversations and constantly worrying about the littlest things during a conversation that someone else would forget in minutes.

I have my finals in 5 hours and haven't been able to get a good amount of sleep this week because my anxiety just won't let me. Its constantly been a burden on my shoulders, if im enjoying my free time and suddenly remember someone's negative response to something i did/said like 3 weeks ago, it will immediately make me lose all enjoyment in the moment and then take me hours to get over it.

I cannot do phone calls, or any form of 1 on 1 conversation with anyone I don't know, Its just the expectation that I feel to either keep the conversation going, start it, etc. It just gets so stressful and I hang up almost immediately.

generalized anxiety and poor social life,"I am really starting to worry about small things (a good chunk was health-related) over the last couple of weeks.

I think i'm becoming too paranoid and it's scaring me,"Sometimes i watch the news and see these girls getting kidnapped and being sold/forced to become porn actresses etc. and to attract these girls they usually tell them lies like ""i'm gonna help you become a model/actress"" etc. and that's how they end up there. 

I actually have an agency right now (although i didn't do much work yet) and when i see news like that my head is always like ""that could happen to you!"" which doesn't make sense to me. I knew about all these stuff beforehand so i did my research to look for serious agencies and the one i'm in was part of a bunch of ""best of"" lists. Famous models started from that agency. If they wanted to kidnap me they had plenty of chances already. But my mind won't stop. At night it gets much worse! Worse to the point where i feel like giving up on my dream and locking myself up at home and never leaving. My mind puts doubts in my head like ""you probably didn't do your research well enough"" or ""what if they made you sign a contract that you weren't aware of?"" or ""do you remember what was written in the contract you signed? I bet you don't and i bet you consented to a bunch of terrible stuff and you won't be able to leave without paying them a huge amount of money"" and it keeps going like that. I fear that someday they'll offer me a job where i'll have to go to another country and i won't be able to accept it because my anxiety will get the best of me. 

And that's not all. I'm usually pretty paranoid about other everyday life stuff as well. Like going out at night, laptop cameras spying on you, being recorded without consent and stuff like that. I suffer from both, anxiety and OCD and i think these are definitely playing a part in how i'm feeling.

I have had them ever since my landlady announced that he was popping in to do a *second* inspection this month... the day before she was actually going to do the inspection. Anyway I was really stressed out because even though my apartment is pretty good cleanliness wise, there is still some stuff lying around like my laundry basket for instance and my bed is unmade. And I have dishes in the dishwasher. And I haven't vacuumed in 2 weeks. And surfaces are clean but not sparkly. And the issue here is that they want the apartments to look perfect at all times. Like a hotel room. Even though these places are extremely cheaply made but enough for me. Anyway I was already stressed out enough because I was having difficulties with my friend and I was also stressed out because I was sick and then management just dropped the fact that I have had my apartment perfect-looking in less than 24 hours and once I was done with the vacuum bag and everything else and I decided to take off my clothes and take a shower I noticed that there were hives all over my body.

Super stressed out about exams,"Life has been a mess for me lately and the amount of panic and anxiety I'm feeling right now could light up at least three cities, one of them being New York. 

Let's start with what caused all of the emotions I'm feeling right now: me starting at university, a pandemic and a break up. 

I started university last year in mid February. I was a big-eyed kid fresh out of high school and couldn't wait to finally start studying Law. You see, I decided I was going to Law school when I was 10 and have been hyperfixated on it since then. Whatever I did for school I did with Law school being my end goal in mind. Everyone in my life knew of my dream and said it was a match made in heaven. 

Since the academic year started in September, I missed out on a lot of coursework. It didn't matter to me. This was what I always dreamt of even if it meant studying all day all night. 

That dream got shattered real quick when the pandemic hit my country 4 weeks later. Suddenly I was pulled out of my dorm and had to follow online classes. It was crazy and I lost the support system I managed to create in those few weeks. Miss Anxiety was doing some overtime back then but with the help of my boyfriend I managed to pass two of my five June examens. This was obviously not enough but I got a second chance in January exams to prove myself.

Well, boyfriend of two years broke up with me right before those January exams. I was devastated. I cried for weeks and could barely move. Sadness and angst hit hard and I genuinely lost whatever little motivation I still had. I know I shouldn't have let it affect me as hard as it did but he was my everything back then and I just saw another part in my life go to sh\*t. It took me six months to get over it. January had long passed and my grades were once again not so stellar. 

Now I have one more exam season to prove myself. If I don't pass for all my exams I will not be allowed to sign up for another year. I feel like I'm prepared for the exams. I watched every online class and have read the books. I still feel like I won't succeed. That I'll fail like the first two times. Like anything I do won't be enough. That I'm not enough. I also feel like I'm running out of time. I know this is Miss Anxiety talking but I just can't stop panicking. I have three more months to prepare for my second chance at the January exams that could still save my butt. Still got the feeling I don't have enough time.

How to validate someone else's emotions without invalidating yourself?,"Any time I talk to my partner about my anxieties, a lot related towards fears of the future and fears of intimacy, I try to take ownership of myself as the source and cause of my emotions. However, my partner tells me frequently that by talking about my fears and anxeties, I make him feel like an awful person and he hears that he can't do anything right. I don't think this at all, I'm not directly saying it, and I'm trying hard not to imply it- but somehow this is what comes across. I want to validate his emotions without agreeing that I have said things I didn't say or intend. I think I'm responsible for my emotions, he's responsible for his, and by misunderstanding me he's hurting his own feelings. But is that fair? Am I unduly burdening him by talking about my worries and insecurities around relationships? Either way I want to apologize for the hurt I've caused but without needing to be a bad person for bringing up the topic at all. He feels awful but I never said or intended to make him feel that way.

What you NEED to know before tapering off psyche meds,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a few people asking about withdrawal symptoms coming off antidepressants. Indeed it's frequent to get withdrawal effects while cutting down on the dosage, and in fact discontinuation syndrome can be very potent. However, one risk that people are not aware of and that can make your life a living hell if your taper is not managed appropriately, is the medical case of **'protracted withdrawal':** if you taper off too quickly from long term treatment, **you can cause chronic damage to your central nervous system, which may not be resolved by going back on the med.** This is something doctors never mentioned, and has only recently been recognised in medical circles. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's what happened to me over the winter. I had been taking Amitriptyline (AMT) for about a year after being diagnosed with chronic insomnia in 2019. Also took Lyrica for a while and came off that easily (almost cold turkey) last year. I had an unsuccessful attempt at tapering off AMT last year but everything came back to normal when I reinstated the original dose. However , when I tried to come off again last winter, it was an absolute disaster: overnight, I developed horrendous anxiety (on the 8th of February), and when I reinstated the original dose of AMT a few weeks after, it did not subside. I'm now at a higher dose of AMT than I was originally and still suffering all day every day (3 months after the onset).  It is debilitating, exhausting, and there is no saying how long it will last. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although this happens in a minority of cases, and most people are able to taper off over a matter of months, my message to anyone on psyche meds wishing to come off is please, really do take your time. **never more than 10% of the dose per month,** and towards the end of the taper, slow down to 5% of the dose per month. The risk of a protracted withdrawal really isn't worth taking. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For people on here who may already be suffering please feel free to find support on the forum below (also includes Benzos withdrawal advice): there are some doctors and many experienced withdrawal veterans who know how to help.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.survivingantidepressants.org](https://www.survivingantidepressants.org)

&amp;#x200B;

Some more advice I wish I'd known:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The reason why it's important to leave 4-6 weeks between dropping dosage is that withdrawal symptoms don't usually appear over night. It usually takes days and sometimes up to a month or so after. if you have decreased the dose again in the meantime you're just fucking yourself over even more.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As soon as you start experiencing withdrawal symptoms, or symptoms that you had never noticed before, stop the taper, and go back up one dose. If you wait and see, it may go away, but if it gets worse, the longer it goes on for, the lower the chances reinstating the med will actually work again.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A successful taper isn't 'I got off this med in X weeks' - it's a taper where you don't suffer. take your time, look after your mind. Listen to your body: if the quality of your sleep deteriorates, your sex drive goes, you lose your appetite, something is not right. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Don't move too quickly when you have stabilised. Just because you don't have withdrawal symptoms anymore after reinstating the dose doesn't mean your mind is fully repaired. Give it a few months without any symptoms before you continue with tapering. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely think Moderators should stick a permanent post on this (will leave up to them to write but happy to help a bit if needed).

Dating? How?,"Well I made a whole post that dissappeared and the fact of thinking I might have posted it somewhere else gave me more anxiety.

I've posted before and I need to say: I do therapy and English is not my first language.

My story is like this: I've suffered from TCAs for the past 12ish years and anxiety disorder.

Never had a boyfriend until I was 26. I felt unattractive and not mentally prepared to do so.

My first boyfriend wasn't a good experience. I told him everything (which I probably shouldn't have) and he used that to manipulate me. He made me feel bad with myself, doubt everything I said, he was mean and destroyed the little confidence I had built over the years. When we broke up he said: you should have known and trusted your instincts.

But I know better, if it where for ""my instincts"" my friends think I'm a burden, I'm not pretty or smart enough for anyone, I say more things than I should and I'm usually wrong. But my instincts are controlled by anxiety.

It took a year to heal from that and I sarted seeing this guy, that I really like. But now I don't know how to deal with my anxious thoughts, I ask him if he really wants to meet me or if he doesn't dare to tell me he doesn't want to. And other things like that. I'm scared of pushing him away, because I can't stop thinking he might not like me and I'm terrified of someone breaking me again.

Today I feel extremely anxious thinking he is distant because of something I said and I'm not sure if he is distant or I feel like that. I feel like I have to guess what he is feeling or I should trust my gut. But do I?

My question is: how do you manage anxiety and dating? How can I tell what's reality from what my brain tries to convince me of? How do I not push people away?

Absolutely exhausted after doctor's visit,"Does anyone else have MASSIVE anxiety around going to / being at the doctor's office? My heart rate was 150. Then 143. Eventually 128. But they kept threatening to send me to the ER because my heart rate and blood pressure were so high (143/98). There went my BPM back up again with the threat... It was like a unrelenting circle. It terrified me thinking of being hospitalized. I've had a lot of autoimmune issues pop up, and was only in the office to talk about aching in my feet and hands. Turns our I have a condition called Raynaud's.

The nurse kept telling me stories about how one girl post-COVID has a seizure. I was absolutely flipping out. They gave me apple juice and water. I felt so vulnerable taking my mask off because we still have COVID cases actively going around, made me panic even more. Understandable they were worried about my BPM, but seriously. What an experience.

Does anyone else get anxiety / panic attacks like this, where their heart rate and BP skyrocket? Mine are so physical that I cannot control them. I even pull muscles in my neck from the tightness, feel the ache in my muscles after it's over. I've gone through the ringer of EKGs, stress tests, echos, (1 day, 1 week, and 30 day holter monitors), etc. Nothing but sinus tachycardia shows up. I'm exhausted.

Recurring anxiety attack(?) lasting a couple days,"I've been trying to Google about this terrible but hard-to-describe feeling I've been going through for over a day now. My brain feels, like, tight(?). Not my head, per se, but like my actual brain feels like it's being compressed in molasses or something.

Anyway, this came out of nowhere. About four nights ago my roommate yelled at me but then apologized later the same night, and that's been the only bad or exceptionally stressful thing that has happened to me in a couple weeks. I'm just saying that besides my last couple final exams I'm wrapping up tonight, nothing \*bad\* has happened to me. I'm not in any danger or in an abusive situation.

It just came out of nowhere. I was sitting there trying to relax and watch an anime, but as fast as you can snap your fingers, I get this sensation that takes over my body. Another Redditor described it as ""a sinking feeling in the stomach, like when you were a very little kid and believed something was lurking in the dark"".

Then I felt as if nothing was real. I switched to trying to watch SNL but couldn't because it didn't feel real. It was really weird. And the realization made me feel like I was losing my mind and so things only got worse from there. I got a blanket because I was slightly shaking, and I had to start slowly pacing because sitting still or laying down made it all so much worse...

I called a hotline. Eventually it mostly subsided but didn't completely go away. She said that I was coherent and making sense, so I wasn't ""losing my mind"" or having some kind of psychotic break. She said that based on what I was describing that it really sounded like I was having a panic attack, and that because I said my symptoms were slowly getting better, that I would be okay if I could ride it out. That's what I did, until I got so exhausted that I didn't care I still had some residual symptoms. I just went to bed.

This morning though after sleeping for over TWELVE HOURS, I still have some of these crappy feelings in my head and in my mind. I'm not asking for a diagnosis; I'm asking if people here on an anxiety sub can relate to some of what I'm describing, and if it \*sounds\* like I am right about thinking this is a recurring anxiety attack. Obviously I would need to go see a doctor.

"[24M] I feel a relief, a sense of self-awareness, and an inner peace by self-diagnosing as autistic","I had brought it up with my family doctor. She said it was possible. Got sent to a psychiatrist, and after one conversation, was told I probably wasn't autistic; yet, I have autistic ""tendencies"", characteristics of someone with autism. The main reason which I was given was essentially that I was able to comprehend/understand everything they were saying and capable of holding a meaningful conversation. Also, I was a little ""too smart"" to be autistic (paraphrasing) considering I was identified as gifted as a child. On a side note, I've read that that often correlates with autism...

So, I wasn't told ""no"", I was told ""I don't think so"". I was also told that they couldn't diagnose me as autistic in one visit. Was I invited back? No. I felt dismissed. But I left that place with an answer, right? ......I'm not autistic.

*That* is what confounded me. I imagine for many, being told they *are* autistic is hard to hear. And those feelings are **completely** valid. But I think mine are too - it was hard to hear that I'm *not*.

If I'm not...

Why does a change in plans become unbearable for me? Why do I need to know every detail of every plan to placate my intrusive subconscious? Why do I get so anxious and frustrated when something doesn't work out as I imagined it? Why do I remember THE MOST random-ass facts about certain topics. Why do I have such a hard time identifying a joke? Why am I so easily the target of having my ""chain yanked"" (because people know what reaction they'll get out of me obviously.) Why does sarcasm often befuddle me? 

The list goes on.

Hey, what if I say that I am?

Self-identifying as autistic helps me explain to myself and others why I have these tendencies. ✅ It gives me a diving board to jump off of, searching for the best way to live my life in spite of these tendencies, and the best way to tackle them. ✅ It allows me to participate in this community which shares tips and resources that help me greatly. ✅ Me. Someone who is ""not autistic"". Why would it help me then? 

I feel at peace. I don't feel disabled or pigeonholed by the label. I feel self-assured. I feel confident. I can conquer the world despite (because of?) autism! It's not a bad thing. That's why it doesn't bother me; moreover, why it takes a weight off my chest.

""Ohhh, that's why I always do X."" 

""Y and Z make sense now. Autism!""

Having a really hard time.,"I'm very new to posting to reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. (I'm also sorry if this is long) I feel like I'm going through a mid-life crisis at 22. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression back in middle school. I feel like I can't really talk to anyone. I have been recently unemployed amidst the pandemic (as of Feb 2nd, 2021)  and my partner of almost 6 years works at a hotel. I have a very high anxiety about disappointing people around me or people being mad at me. During this pandemic I feel as if my partner has become completely uninterested in me and doesn't want to be around me and that terrifies me. I feel like a loser even talking about all this. At home they have headphones in most of the day and I feel bad trying to talk to them because I'm so scared of making them angry at me but I also don't want them to feel as if I don't care because I do very much. We don't go out much at all anymore (other than to their work and back) Most of the day I end up just scrolling social media mindlessly. I just want it to go back to when we went out and goofed around and they enjoyed my company and I don't know how to bring this up to them because I just don't want to upset them because I love them. 
    
  Another thing that makes me feel incredibly anxious is the fact that I can't hold a job. Things always start out great but in the past two years I have been in a vicious cycle of getting a job, getting incredibly anxious about said job within a few months and having anxiety attacks before or during work, causing me to miss a lot, and then quitting or getting fired. This time around, even looking for a job online is causing me dread because I kinda feel like I'm in limbo and have no idea what I even want to do. 

While I've been incredibly low energy for weeks, I can't  seem to get any sleep either which is really annoying since I drive my little brother to school and my partner to work every morning and have to wake up at 7:35 a.m. 
 
I just feel like everything is going way too fast and I have no time to catch up.

Need help on how to alleviate anxiety since I'm a bit stuck,"Half ADVICE NEEDED/VENTING because I can only do one flair

I realised a few weeks ago that everyone thinks about themselves more than other people, and that helped me to be more comfortable (as I thought everyone saw my mistakes beforehand) but now I am faced with more problems, probably an inferiority complex and anxiety at school. It's one of these things where you can talk about it for hours and still not feel satisfied.

I heard some girls in one of my classes talk about how they're getting part time jobs and how they're going to be responsible and make money, and that got me thinking that even though I thought of myself as mature, these people are clearly actually doing something and profiting from it. Even my friend who is introverted manages to do a lot of things better than me, he's a master programmer and I (literally) have no redeemable qualities compared to him and other people. I know quite a lot about game design and development but even then it feels very minor compared to things that other people can do.

People of my age are probably already losing their virginities, getting significant others and while I'm not actively searching to do that (I did nofap because I thought it was the reason behind my anxiety - and it was, but it wasn't the only reason) I do feel left out because of it. I also overheard a conversation about a group of people my age having a house party and drinking alcohol, and another conversation about people doing drugs and recording their friends doing it because its ""funny"". Again I don't want to do either of these things but part of me just feels that I'm missing out on something, I won't be able to experience some of these things the same way they did.

I also can't speak normally, at home I'm fine and everything but when speaking to people I barely know at school my voice goes super deep and I keep having to repeat myself just so they can understand what I mean, followed by awkward silence. It's not even that I'm saying anything weird. I tried and tried many times with different methods to try overcome this but so far quite literally nothing has come out of it.

I feel that the potential to be better is just there but something is blocking me from doing it, and I need advice on what to do next. I've already tried talking to someone close (no good results), building up my willpower helped somewhat but the problems still persist, I don't want to try therapy because that would mean my parents finding out and no matter what they must not know, I don't want to worry them or make it awkward.

I thought that the solution would be having a close person hug me, tell me that everything will be alright and say the perfect words (not fake, not saying that everything will be fine just for the sake of it and to cheer me up) but I realised that it is no good dwelling on fantasies that won't happen, because the problem will just get worse. 

If anyone is still interested on giving me advice after that eye-jarring wall of text, please tell me something more practical to do, something that will actually help and not these fake reassurances that it'll be fine/problem will be fixed on it's own, because I am seriously f\*\*\*ing tired of being this depressed and wanting attention, I never used to be like this and I want to revert back into that state or improve for it.",Axonn368,2,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5sksn/need_help_on_how_to_alleviate_anxiety_since_im_a/

What to do about it?...,"I’m suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, started seeing a therapist half a year ago.

I told my therapist about it last week and when he realised how I was doing he proposed seeing a psychiatrist and asked if I could imagine myself going into a clinic and if so he suggested putting myself on a waiting list. 

Fast forward I had the appointment today and got prescribed some meds. 

And here comes the problem...surprisingly the last three days have been a little bit better or at least I believe they feel like that and now this thought started creeping into my head “what if it’s not that bad overall, do you really need the meds or are you just taking them to go the easy way or to overdramatise your situation and be able to tell people that you had to take meds”...

I don’t know, but this thought just rumours my head all day long and even tho thinking back at some of my recent worst days, when I really knew for sure that I needed some help like medicine to continue, right now I feel like I can’t allow myself to take them without feeling or believing that the above might be the truth...it’s like I would need to be at rock bottom again to allow myself to take the help",licensed_overthinker,2,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5s46l/what_to_do_about_it/
Vaccine anxiety? Panic attacks won't stop. Don't know how to cope.,"This might be long. It's my first time posting anything on a subreddit, really. I feel like my friends and family are tired of hearing about it or just don't have anything else to add so I don't know where to turn.

Brief history: I have GAD and depression, I've tried several medications over the last decade. I don't have much of a history with panic attacks, or at least not as I understand the term. Looking back, I do wonder now if some of my episodes were panic attacks, and that I just didn't *really* know that's what they were like until now. My first obvious panic attack with physical symptoms began as I went under for a surgery. I remember reaching for someone and saying something was wrong, then losing consciousness, and it continued the very moment I was conscious again in recovery. I thought something had gone horribly wrong and/or I was dying. I could not breathe, except I obviously could. It felt like endless minutes that I desperately fought for air while clearly getting enough air to freak out. After I left the hospital it didn't happen again. 

Fast forward a few years to April 2nd of 2021. I'm in a clinic about to receive my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I'm actually super excited, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. And I'm not scared of shots, I've had many medical problems and have been poked and prodded and humiliated and in debilitating pain, a needle is nothing. Except when the needle goes into my arm it feels like someone grabbed my heart with their hands and tried to crush it. It was over as soon as it happened, but still alarming. I manage to walk into the observation room to wait out the 15 minutes before I can go, but something doesn't feel right. I'm lightheaded, my chest starts to feel tight and hurt, I fear I'm going to drop dead at any second. I flag down a nurse and she assesses my condition and very kindly tries to assure me, catching on that it's probably anxiety long before I even consider it as a possibility. All the other patients are staring at me, unashamedly interested, or maybe paranoid that it's some sort of reaction they're witnessing. The nurse hovers over me a little too much. I know she means well but this is all making the anxiety worse, so I lie that I feel better and I go home, thinking it will stop when I crawl into my own bed. It doesn't. It lasts for several hours with small periods (under ten minutes) of feeling like it might end soon in between. The next day I'm fine.

I'm fine for about two weeks, and then it happens again. For a full 7 days. If it stops, it doesn't feel like it. It's day and night of heart palpitations and lightheadedness and fear. I listen to TED talks and read dozens of articles and cry and feel like I'm going crazy. I get my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 2nd, expecting it to be even worse because now I'm living in fear of what will happen this time, and my symptoms finally just...dissipate. There's no scary jolt in my heart, and the lightheadedness and tingling and chest tightness subside over the course of the day. I assume this weird episode in my life is over. I feel incredibly stupid, especially considering I wasn't scared of getting the vaccine in the first place. I'm ashamed and think all my friends are probably thinking I'm a hypochondriac. 

I talk to my primary care physician and she suggests we rule out anything heart-related before changing my medicine, because I've always had a fast heart rate. EKG is normal. I still get an appointment with a cardiologist. I go on May 4th, yesterday. Everything looks fine, EKG is normal there too. The doctor wants to schedule an echocardiogram and order a heart monitor to wear for the next 30 days, just to be sure. My good mood goes swirling down the drain because I don't want to do all this. It's taking too damn long. I'm starting a new job on Saturday and I just want to change my meds before it strikes again. I get in the car to go home and start feeling tingly and light headed and I get pissed because, really, honestly? Why? I was fine, and now I'm not? After a low stress doctor's visit? I get through it and tell myself that it will pass, that it WON'T last for hours because I simply refuse, and after an hour or so I feel somewhat okay again, and gradually feel normal. 

This morning I take my little sister to school, eat some breakfast and lie down watching Youtube videos. I'm a little tired so I close my eyes. Light suddenly dances behind my eyelids and my face feels weird, so I open them again. I get the familiar wheezy feeling in my chest (sometimes it's pressure, sometimes it's like I'm short of breath without actually being short of breath), my limbs feel tingly and go numb, and of course, I feel like I'm about to die. I grapple with it from 8:30ish to 11:30ish and manage to fall asleep. I wake up at 2pm still feeling on the precipice and fight my way through it until almost 5pm as I'm typing this now. It's mostly subsided but I'm still lightheaded and anxious. I don't know when my echocardiogram is yet, my next doctor's visit with my PCP is in a week and I start my new job in less than 2 days. I'm currently taking Wellbutrin and Buspirone and it's felt like they were doing nothing for me for a while now, but I haven't had the time or the money to search for an actual psychiatrist and therapist, and weaning off meds and starting new ones is such a PAIN that I've been putting it off, so this is the prize I won. 

How do I get through this when it seems to be happening purely out of fear for the next one? How do I not freak out when I start my job? I'm so afraid of it happening at work, right as I'm starting this job I fought so hard to get all throughout the pandemic. I do all the grounding techniques and tell myself it'll end soon and it can't last forever and it still happens, it's never over in 30 minutes, it always takes an hour to several hours to calm down.",murdermuffin666,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5rz0h/vaccine_anxiety_panic_attacks_wont_stop_dont_know/

Help moving past an anxious dating experience,"I've been struggling with social anxiety for much of my life.

Recently this flared up while I was dating a girl after I met her friends. I got pretty into my head she wasn't interested in me because of it and didn't communicate any of that with her or that I'm socially anxious.

The last time I saw her in person I was so anxious and convinced it was going to not end well that I told her in a sort of weird way that I was in my head and anxious before I left. We texted about what I meant the following few days but ultimately decided to go our separate ways. 

I was really in my head about how much anxiety I had and how out of control my thoughts got. We had a nice time together but now I feel a bit jaded from the experience and am also feeling a bit depressed.

I don't feel like my usual self and don't know what to do. I feel like my self esteem took quite a hit from how anxious I got and how I communicated it. I really like to know where I stand with people in relationships and feel anxiety and rumination just derailed it. 

I'm trying to move on and regain my confidence but am also ruminating and feeling detached and in my head.

I'm having an Illness/Death Anxiety relapse after six years,"I'm sorry this is so long, but I don't know where else to turn. I can hardly function anymore. 

This started with pericoronitis over an impacted wisdom tooth. It was excruciating, and the many doctors I saw were slow to diagnose it and treat it. In fact, the oral surgeon I saw insisted the wisdom tooth *wasn't* the problem and told me to come back in 3-4 weeks for a follow-up. The antibiotic I was on ran out, and then, four days later, the infection was back. The second time around, it was even more excruciating. I had the tooth extracted a month ago, and because I got dry socket, there is this gaping hole in my mouth still. In the meantime, I also had to have a root canal and two fillings, all on the bottom-right side of my mouth. 

All I think about is the infection coming back. This hole in my mouth is like an open wound, and there is so much bacteria in the mouth. I clean the extraction site with salt water in a syringe three times a day. I use a mouthwash for dry mouth. I brush my teeth. But I still have three of my four wisdom teeth. They feel like ticking time bombs. 

I am also seven weeks pregnant, and if the remaining teeth get infected like the first, they will be unable to remove them until the baby is born. So what then? I'll have an infection and excruciating pain for nine months? The infection will burn me out? I have another child and a husband. I cry all the time when I think about dying and leaving them. Not seeing my little girl grow up. Not being here with them anymore. Our lives were perfect before this. Sometimes, I feel like my anxiety is ruining our life.

The pericoronitis caused a terrible taste in my mouth as well as pain. I am so afraid every time I drink water that this taste is going to be back in my mouth. There is a metallic and sometimes sour taste in my mouth, and I think, ""Well, what if that is the precursor to the other taste? The gross, infected taste? What if tomorrow, I wake up, and my mouth is full of that taste? And the infection is back?""

Today, I looked at my bottom-left gum in the back (the opposite side, where I still have a wisdom tooth), and I thought it was separated from the back tooth, and that leaves a pocket. I am so afraid bacteria and food are going to get in, and it is going to get infected. Plus, my gum back there now feels sensitive, as do my teeth. I have trouble opening my jaw all the way because I grind and clench my teeth all night long and because I've had so many procedures done in the last two months.

Plus, the anxiety also hits me at the same time every day: between 3 and 4 PM, when I have to get ready to eat. Eating was so painful when I had the infection. Plus, by 4 PM, all doctors' and dentists' offices are closed for the day, so I can't get in for an appointment if something flares up over night. The ER won't treat tooth issues except with pain management, and I'm pregnant so it's Tylenol only. The weekends are *horrid,* because no dentists' offices are open. The only place to go is the ER, and I've already been twice. They suggested Tylenol and essential oils for pain and Benadryl for sleep. 

I am seeing a therapist twice a week. She suggested affirmations, and in the mornings, those work. In the midst of a panic attack, nothing works. I try to read or play games or watch TV just to get my mind off of it, just to make the anxiety stop, but it's always there at this time of day (4 PM ET), and it just *hurts.* Not only me, but my family, too. 

None of the dentists I've seen can agree on what is causing me all this pain still. One said I need another root canal, and the endodontist said no way, he's not drilling into another tooth for no reason. I've burned through all my goodwill with the oral surgeon because I was in there almost every day right after the surgery, asking him to check for signs of infection. Plus, I went to another surgeon in his practice for a second opinion because I told them straight up that I felt he was missing something, and I needed someone else to look at it. I've had more X-rays and exams done in the last month than I can count. I told myself, ""If there's no swelling, no pain, and no fever, then there's no infection."" Well, I have minor swelling in my cheek, and I still have pain, but I have no fever. But I've read that some dental infections don't cause a fever, but they can still spread quickly into surrounding tissues, which makes them particularly dangerous. 

I'm not even me anymore. My husband and I tried for six months to conceive this wonderful baby, and I can't even be fully excited. I am so afraid of something terrible happening. Another infection. A miscarriage. I can't play with my daughter all day anymore, because the panic just knocks me down. 

Has anyone dealt with anything like this? How did you cope? I just want my life back. 

Tl;dr- I am struggling with the worst bout of Illness and Death Anxiety that I've had in years. This was triggered by a recurring infection, a surgery, a painful recovery process, multiple dental issues, and ongoing tooth and jaw pain.

Heightened anxiety after vaccine,"I got my J&amp;J shot on the 8th of April and I’ve been having a rough time since then. 

I think I’ve been dealing with head inflammation or neural inflammation. My head feels swollen and then I get sharp pains and brain zaps and my neck gets stiff. It triggered my anxiety really bad and it didn’t help that when I went to the ER they misdiagnosed me with a thrombosis in my brain because they misread the CT scan. My doctor told me head inflammation is fine and to take some ibuprofen but it seems to make it worse. I think the inflammation is worsening my anxiety. 

How long did it take for anxiety to go away after your vaccine? I’m really on edge and I’ve been through this before from meditation and I’m afraid it’s my new normal.

[TW: Panic Attack/Family Stuff/Trauma],"My sister and I live in a very toxic environment. My dad harasses my sister and I both but this post is about my sister.

The effect of the harassment has reached a breaking point for my sister where she has panic attacks because of him. She’s barely able to function. Crying constantly, on edge, easily scared, nauseous, not eating, not sleeping. It’s only recently developed as far as I’m aware. I’m looking for advice on what to do here… I’m trying to help her best I can by reminding her it’s gonna be ok, it’ll get better, encouraging her to breathe deeply, helping her out with getting food and being available and near her.

We mostly stay in her room. We don’t feel free to leave it because of my dad. We only go outside of her room if we hear my dad isn’t and even then, tip-toe around so as not to make our presence known. But I am the person to go out there if needed because it’s too anxiety-inducing for my sister.

She feels there’s no end to her suffering in sight. She feels inconsolable and not able to be helped because it is endless anxiety and panic. She can’t relax and hasn’t been able to for a week. But even then, it is impossible to fully relax here. We cope through distraction and isolating ourself in every way. But that only helps so much.

Our home life has always been rough. Damage recovery and survival mode is the norm here. My mom and my sister have been a target for him to insult and degrade and belittle and harass for as long as I can remember.

But despite all that, I’ve never seen my sister like this, the point of barely functioning. She doesn’t seem well at all and I just really need help. I don’t know what to do. How can I help her to feel better? She’s in pure survival mode. She needs to eat and sleep. Every thought about our dad and every interaction is so anxiety-inducing and panic-inducing she almost throws up.

She keeps it really loud in her room so she doesn’t hear my dad shouting at my mom or if he knocks on her door but I feel like it isn’t helping her. She says it’s made her feel more anxious because it’s so loud and I would guess it doesn’t help her sleeping either but she keeps it, and the loudness must stay because she can’t be able to hear what’s going on outside her room. The loudness helps her feel protected. So she hates the loudness but also feels she needs it is what I’m trying to say.

Talking to my dad about this is not an option. I’m not going to go into too many details because it is simply just too much and too triggering and just generally so exhausting and feels like a waste of energy to talk about him. But just know it’s like dealing with a child bully and so talking to him about basic decency is not an option.

What can I do? How can I make living here better for her? I need help. Please help.",wringer03,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5ud1x/tw_panic_attackfamily_stufftrauma/
I swear my long term friends are losing interest in me,I'm just not interesting. I don't talk about anything but moping around about all of my problems and NOBODY wants to hear that so most of the time I don't even talk at all. I've had my friends for years and it seems like they're slowly backing away from me as I fall victim to depression and anxiety. I can't make any new friends because I'm so bad at socialising. They would just not see me as having enough to say. I have a lot of things to say but when I get too comfortable and do that then they see me as weird. I don't want to be lonely but it feels like I'm just a weirdo to my friends and none of them actually ever want to hang out with me.

And I got little waves of derealization (best I can explain) and started thinking about death again  and I had a lot of caffeine so tonight isn’t gonna be fun. It’s my fault but i just don’t wanna feel like this. Like always on edge and anxious. I’m also getting really lonely. I stopped talking to my friends and I barely talk to my family even though I’m around them a lot. I just don’t feel like i fit in anywhere and I get really self conscious about everything. At this point I’ve given up in school. I’ve lost motivation and I keep self sabotaging myself &amp; overthinking about everything. I’ve basically been like accepting the anxiety at this point and I don’t really feel it as intensely anymore so it’s really just physical symptoms like chest tightening shortness of breath and pains/cramps. Idk it just sucks and idek if some of it is anxiety or just health problems in general. I been getting mood swings and shit like that and it’s messing with my head because I’ll just get really angry and that’s how I ended up cutting myself or really depressed and I’ll just lay in bed and do nothing all day.

Replying to messages,"Hi guys, I’m wondering if there’s anyone else that has this same problem, or if not maybe someone could give me some advice. I find it really hard replying to messages and emails. It all started a couple of years ago when I had a big fallout with my family, It happened around the time I moved out with my girlfriend. My mum didn’t like my girlfriend and convinced most of my family she was a bad person, anyway it’s a long story I won’t get into. I received many unpleasant texts from her and other family members and I still get the odd one. Before all of this occurred I would generally reply to any text the same day, now I sort of shut off and subconsciously avoid opening texts from anyone, I reply to my now wife frequently as her chat on iMessages is always open when I open the app, but I avoid ever checking other messages and I feel like this anxiety has been caused by the long term array of unpleasant messages from family. I wouldn’t call myself an introvert, although neither an extrovert, I have no problem making conversation in person and I’ll even chat to people I don’t know if a random conversation starts, but  when it comes to messaging I just seem to shut off.

I also seem to have developed this same problem with emails. When we both moved out together, we went through a year of financial struggle. Bills kept coming in and I’d usually have to call the provider to ask for extensions etc, and when the bills were paid there usually wasn’t more than $50-100 left for the week which quickly became absorbed by food and petrol etc. we’re now much better off financially, we have no problems paying bills on time and we’re even saving money now. Although I seem to have developed this anxiety when it comes to checking my emails as I used to be so scared of that surprise bill in my inbox that would wipe out our bank balance, or often even worse when there was no money left. A couple of times I’ve avoided checking my inbox for so long that bills have ended up overdue and I didn’t even know until I receive a call from the provider telling me I need to pay. 
Is there anyone else that has this same problem? I now just try to force myself to do it and I’m improving but I still really struggle and I hate being like this.",throwaway1643788,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5u0ji/replying_to_messages/
Dropping out of medical school due to anxiety,"Hello,

I started my first year in the medical school of my dreams after years of hard work but I’m now looking into the possibility of dropping out.
My anxiety has worsened and despite loving the degree, my anxiety is becoming a very big barrier and it is sucking out every inch of enjoyment . My engagement in the classroom has been abysmal. I don’t think I ever spoke more than 2 sentences in the last two semester. At the beginning, I did try but my attempts at becoming more social and less anxious were futile, so at the sight of any problem I would hide which has left me looking like an outcast. This is not the kind of behaviour you’d like to see in a doctor and feel so incompetent. I truly don’t think I’m equipped anymore. 
Within my cohort, we are separated into groups of 10 and I am the one who doesn’t speak at all. It is downright triggering seeing everyone on one side of the room whilst I’m on the other trying to figure out how to engage with them after so long. My anxiety is triggered by abandonment issues, so feeling isolated and separated is a concoction for an anxiety disaster. 

I am Dropping out. However, I know for a fact that down the line I’d hate myself for making that decision and can see myself falling into depression. On top of that, I have no back up plan and my parents would be greatly disappointed at knowing their daughter couldn’t handle it because of anxiety (they find mental illness quite trivial - old school peeps).

She’s not giving me a reason not to trust her or anything but no matter how much I try my mind always thinks the worse and it controls my life.

Impostor syndrome anyone? (Analogy used might be triggering),"The school curator is going to call me this week and it looks like I'm finally going to get some help with my anxiety.

But now I feel as if it's not a problem anymore. I know I still have my social anxiety and I'm fully aware of the depressions is causes. 

But I feel like an imposter.

Everytime I've started getting serious about getting help in the past I've started feeling like an imposter which has caused my to back down from getting help.

Yesterday I had a rutine year one health checkup at school. And I talked about my problems. First time I've ever opened up and I had no issues talking about my feelings.

But now, I feel like I've lied. But I know I haven't.

Think of it like this.

Bob is a cop, he thinks ""I wouldn't have any problems shooting someone to save a life.""

Next thing you know, Bob has to shoot someone to save a life. Bob never mentally recovers and eventually quits the force.

I feel like everytime I start thinking of getting help. I become the Bob before he shoots someone. I minimize my problems to the point where I cannot even relate to myself.

It's like I keep shooting people to save lives(could've picked a better analogy), but as soon as I've gone through that hell, I forget it, and repeat it. Making it difficult to open up.

I had no issues knowing what I felt yesterday, but now, I'm clueless. It's like trying to explain how someone else feels.

Advice for Starting Therapy (Again),"To be brief, I've had a really hard time managing my anxiety and depression within the past several months for a number of reasons (COVID, college graduation/job hunt, friendship struggles, etc.) I am finally coming around to the idea of going to therapy after my parents and a close friend of mine have recently recommended that I go. I have gone to four different therapists in my childhood (last time being at age 16, I am currently 22) and never really felt that therapy was something that was helpful for me. I dreaded going for a while during this time and never felt completely comfortable with the idea of opening up to someone like that. It's getting to the point though currently where I feel like my life is seriously being impacted by my anxiety and depression and so I am willing to possibly give therapy a try again. 

For those who have found success in therapy, do you have any advice you would give to someone who is nervous/hesitant about it? Those who have had similar experiences (going to therapy throughout childhood and as an adult) have you been able to get better experiences out of therapy now?

ADDITIONALLY, just in general, since I had only been previously while I was a child, I never had searched for therapists myself. Any advice on good ways to find a therapist?

I feel like a finally conquered anxiety nausea!,"i made a post a while back, and i mean a *while* back, about how my main anxiety symptom was anxiety nausea and vomiting. it seriously was debilitating and i was avoiding situations that triggered it. i did a few sessions of talk therapy and was given some tools to combat it and thought i’d share: 

(note: i am in no way saying that therapy is a cure for anxiety or that everyone needs to seek therapy. it’s not one size fits all!)

my therapist told me that the nausea and vomiting from anxiety is rooted in a “reset pattern” my anxious brain was trapped in. so when i’d feel anxious, my brain and body would try to purge to reset, like advanced fight or flight. but the anxiety does that because it feels like it’s reacting to an actual danger. i’d get anxious, puke (not willingly), feel better for .02 seconds because my body *thought* it had made itself safe again, but it’s a cycle. my brain was being trained to think that the nausea and vomiting was a necessary part to calm myself down. (insert clown emoji here)

it took work, but i had to manually change that step and talk myself down instead of accepting that i had to feel sick in order to get through the anxiety. so i chose breathing exercises. 4 second inhale, hold, 5 second exhale. until i felt the nausea pass (so however long i needed to do it). i was told that you can really choose anything that you know will get your mind off of it: reciting the alphabet, counting, doing push ups, wall sits, planks. anything that requires some sort of mental/physical focus. after a couple times doing that, i felt like i was able to break back out of the nausea creeping up instead of letting it consume me. now, i feel like i don’t experience the nausea much as a main symptom because i’ve retrained my way of picturing the “reset”. if i feel anxiety starting to build, i take a moment to step back and “reset” and where, before, it’d be dry heaving and feeling sick until i could calm down, now it’s taking a break and doing several rounds of breathing, maybe even focusing on different sensations in my body, to reground myself. 

*ANOTHER NOTE: i *really* don’t want this to come across like “i did a breathing exercise and now i’m cured!”. this is just what helped me with this specific symptom, not my anxiety as a whole. it takes more work than breathing and boy do i know that.",acidaciliegie,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5tbjj/i_feel_like_a_finally_conquered_anxiety_nausea/

Needing Support Badly,"I apologize if there’s any triggers in this, I’m not sure what all is considered a trigger.

Monday morning probably around 1 am I was trying to fall asleep and I’m not sure what happened. I don’t know if I truly did have difficulty breathing or if my anxiety caught my breathing slowing down because of trying to fall asleep. When I noticed, I had the most major panic attack. Probably the worst one I’ve had in my life (and I’ve had billions lmao) it made me feel like I was dying of a heart attack. 

So, later that day I went to the emergency room. They ran a EKG on me which the result came out normal. Chest x-ray also came out normal. Of course, my anxiety was not satisfied with the result. I was still anxious they missed something because they didn’t do no blood tests or even a urine test.

Yesterday I ended up being anxious/paranoid about a possible blood clot due to me remembering how my legs have been sore lately for the past 2 to 3 weeks and how a certain spot on my lower right calf is tender to the touch. It sent me to a panic mode so I called my insurances nurse hotline and she suggested to go back to the emergency room again.

After waiting hours and finally getting seen, they did a ultrasound on both of my legs. You’d think I’d feel better after that, but I don’t (the results came back good; no signs of blood clots) I was so anxious if the lady who was doing the ultrasound missed the spot on my leg where it was tender (even though I pointed it out to her. It didn’t feel like she went over it but I wasn’t paying too much attention and I wasn’t looking) nonetheless she did the entire leg from the front view and the area where I was having tenderness. I think my anxiety was just being an asshole to me.

Now I’m anxious she missed the spot and that they missed a blood clot because she didn’t do the specific spot. Honestly at this point my anxiety is getting so out of hand. I have my next psychiatrist appointment this Thursday and I’m really hoping she figures out what I can do.

I just really need support... to know that I’m not crazy for being on edge about my health. I grew up watching family members have severe illnesses and pass away on us.

Dentist anxiety (trigger warning teeth discussed),"At the beginning of April I had a badly infected tooth to the point that I could barely open my mouth. For the oral surgeon to see if they could remove it he had to forcible open my mouth. This was very traumatic. Cut to last week I have part of a tooth crack and turned out I had a giant cavity. I have a root canal done and have a full break down before the procedure. Like gasping for air and crying. So I went back today to get a crown put on but my blood pressure was too high so the dentist wouldn’t do it. This of course this sent me spiraling once again. 

I go back next week to try again, but I am terrified ya just going to happen all over again. Has anyone experienced something like this and been able to “concur” it? I feel that it is now getting into ptsd territory. (Not looking for a diagnosis just so stating how I am feeling.)

Am I being stupid?,"Hiya,

&amp;#x200B;

Been really overwhelmed the past few hours over what I'm sure is a very stupid reason, so I thought I'd post here to see if someone could just say whether I'm needlessly worrying or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a driving lesson tomorrow, but my girlfriend has asked me to come to a flat viewing with her (she's been looking for ages and it's the first one she's found), she is worried as it's in an area she doesn't know with people she's never met so she wanted me there. Problem is that the viewing directly clashes with my driving lesson, so I have to choose. The other issue is that I've already had to cancel 2 lessons over the past 3 weeks (1 time I paid for the lesson, one I didn't have to). I'm wanting to cancel my lesson tomorrow but I'm really worried that my instructor is going to turn around and drop me from lessons with her. I'm prepared to pay for the lesson still.

Had to leave work because of a panic attack and my boss was NOT happy,"So I have awful anxiety as well as a panic disorder. Sometimes I get spontaneous panic attacks for no reason. I work for a RV dealership and occasionally we rent out a large football stadium and have an RV show. My job is to wash and detail RVs, so my work sent me to the stadium to wash and detail our RVs. We use a work truck fitted with a power washer and I drove this truck almost 30 miles to the football stadium.

About 3 hours in I had a huge panic attack and tried to fight it off. I could not calm myself down, so I decided to go home. When I panic, my social anxiety reaches it's peak and I usually cannot speak to anyone. Therefore I left our RV show without telling any of my managers. I planned to arrive at home and then call HR and explain what happened.

Of course, coincidentally, my boss began calling me over and over the moment I arrived at home before I had a chance to contact anyone and explain anything. My manager is someone I respect and is very chill but he was FUMING that I left the RV show without telling anyone.  Apparently they needed the truck really badly as well (which is something I was not told).

 I said I left because of a medical issue and my manager immediately asked what happened. I explained that I had a panic attack and could not speak to anyone so I went home. I asked if he needed a doctor's note and he said yes. I called my doctor's office and they said they would call me back later. I'm now freaking out because my doctor's office takes forever to do anything. I don't know what to do if they don't call me back today and I'm concerned I will be fired because I'm frequently late (due to anxiety).

Overall I feel like absolute and utter shit. No one takes mental health seriously these days. I have made immense progress with my mental health and this job is the first job I've held for over 5 months in a very long time. I've also been clean for over a year. I've made so much progress but my mental health always fucks something up. I honestly don't know what to do, I'm sure my manager thinks I'm lying about everything.

TL:DR I left a work outing because of a panic attack. I drove the company car to the outing and then parked it back at my home store. My manager called me, fuming, asking what happened and where the company car is. I explained what happened and he was still super mad.",keepmovingon69,2,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5n47z/had_to_leave_work_because_of_a_panic_attack_and/
Participants needed!,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

We are conducting a study as part of our Master's degree at Lund University. This study aims to investigate relationships between emotion perception and different forms of anxiety, and is very important in gaining more knowledge in this field. The study consists of some questions prior to a fun reaction task!

This study has to be done on a **computer**, since it cannot be performed on a mobile phone. The study should take about 15-19 minutes to complete.

If you have any questions or feedback on the study, please feel free to reach out to either one of us! Are you interested in helping us gain more insight in the mechanisms of anxiety? Then click the link below:

Boyfriend not getting vaccine,"I have been so anxious lately about the fact my boyfriend does not seem to care about getting the covid vaccine. I am a healthcare worker with a high risk population and got vaccinated in February, but I’m still terrified of my boyfriend possibly getting sick and me possibly spreading it on my unit. I have tried to explain to him why it is a big deal, especially with him going to the gym more and going out to eat more, but he just doesn’t seem to think he is at risk at all. It’s not even that he is against the vaccine, it’s just he’s too lazy to go, which is what he told me himself.  It’s so frustrating and I can feel myself getting more anxious to the point where I’m afraid this will cause a breakup if he doesn’t decide to get it soon. I know it’s his choice and I will admit I’m being pushy even when I am trying to explain as calmly as possible why it’s important, but I have a lot more at stake if he gets sick and exposes me.

Cold Turkey off zoloft,"I’ve (30f) been taking Zoloft for almost two years- it has been amazing in the sense that I kept going to the ER several times a week truly thinking I was dying. I was dx panic disorder and went on Zoloft. It helped TREMENDOUSLY with my anxiety, me thinking I was always dying and just gave me that little pep I guess. I stopped worrying about dying every 5 seconds. I took it right for the majority of the time but the last month or so I’ve been really inconsistent. 

For a sleep study I have to do, they want me off all of my meds for 3 weeks for a sleep study to be “purists”. I’m also on midodrine for my POTS, but I absolutely can’t and won’t get off of that. It’s my lifeline currently. Since I’ve been off the Zoloft completely for the last 9 days (I stupidly went cold turkey because I’ve been so busy I hadn’t thought about taking it) and I’m in *so* much pain. I’ve had headaches, anxiety is rearing it’s ugly head back. I’m in constant body pain, moreso after I stopped. 

Today I had such unbearable stomach pain in target that I kind of dissociated in the middle of the aisle. I didn’t know where I was or how to get out, I was just trying to breathe through the pain- I didn’t remember the last 5 min. I just booked it and left. I was wearing kind of tight high waisted leggings. I got a severe pain above my belly button, nothing has ever been found but this occurrence was the worst. I wasn’t able to say “did you know it’s cinco de Mayo” but I heard myself say something out loud that didn’t make sense with what I thought I was saying. I felt SO weird, like spaced out thinking I was dying.

Judgement Anxiety...I think...,"LSS: I am in my late 30s, 1st time in a Sales Job (I have worked in Tech Support for a CRM Tool, Project/Product Manager and Programmer, and other odd jobs), and I have several ideas for generating my Own Leads...but they All Involve me selling Myself, and most of them involve me sitting and letting people come up to me.

When I was a kid, I felt like I was talking about things on levels that nobody else would even try to understand...they would just talk above me or come to their Own Conclusion about what I meant; which would be disheartening and annoying and caused me to act out in my own ways. But that is the root of what causes me to have a lot of trouble selling myself.   
Even now, i am thinking of ""why I should not be complaining"",...like talking about my Anxiety is an Inconvenience on the Anxiety Forum.  


ready for a running sentence...I am pretty sure that since I was hired and figured that a large part of my job would be selling, something I have Actively Avoided to this point, that means I would need to be able to sell myself as someone Person X would want to talk to about Product ABC...and even now, I am thinking to myself how smart I know I am and how fast my brain works, but also how much that can be a detriment because I will literally think of several things to say and my voice gets caught trying to say anything...  


Which can lead to a Self-Doubt spiral....frickin vicious gd cycles of fear and self-doubt...I mean...WHAT IF I don't know the Answer to a Question??? Their image of me as a Salesperson might be tarnished...oh no.../s

Sending messages in groupchats makes me feel sick with anxiety and I so tired of it. But i dont know how to stop it,"I was added to a groupchat because I'm on a university society committee next year (I joined in an attempt to help my social and generalised anxiety but I'm already regretting that decision big time) 

there were already messages in the group chat when I noticed I had been added talking about when to hand over between new and old committee cos everyone is busy with exams. Everyone (both old and new) had put in when was ideal for them. 

This was a few hours before I had even seen the messages but I thought I should let them know when I was free, most people have read my message but nobody has responded. 

Part of me knows this isn't a problem, if was the other way around I wouldn't feel the need to reply to each person and would just wait till   everyone had given dates and then decided when to hand over. 

But I can't stop checking my phone to see if anyone has replied or posted in the chat at all. I feel sick with anxiety that I've made a fool of myself somehow.

 I keep thinking 'what if they didn't need the dates you were free' or 'what if you've read the messages wrong and they were organising something else' even though I know this is completely stupid and irrational. I'm 20 years old, I shouldnt be feeling like this over a bloody groupchat

Because of lockdown I havent needed to leave the house or socialise that much and as a result of havent felt this level of anxiety for a while (though I knew from day one that it would be temporary and as soon as things started opening back up again the anxiety would comeback) but almost immediately after sending I'm feeling really anxious and stressed to the point I've just decided to go to bed early.

I can’t go more than 50 feet from my house without gagging,"A little bit of context, I have been struggling with an overactive gag reflex for as long as I can remember. I have always had trouble at the dentist, and for many years that was the extent of it. More recently, about a year and a half ago, I started struggling with gagging under stressful situations such as running or working out at the gym. Sometimes I would even gag just by thinking  about a stressful situation or or the feeling of gagging itself. This specifically has become a lot more common. It’s gotten to the point where I have needed a water bottle or just water in my mouth if I was going more than 50 feet from my house. Sometimes even this doesn’t work as well, and I have to turn back and head home.

Please I need help,"My story: I moved from Orange County, CA to Las Vegas, NV September of last year. I got a new job teaching from home. About 4 months ago I started experiencing anxiety, insomnia, and depression. I have no idea why. I don’t necessarily like living in Vegas, but I wanted to stay for at least a few years because most of my family lives here. I’ve tried SO many things: meditation, supplements, CBD, no electronics 1 hour before bed, get out of bed if I can’t sleep, etc etc. I’m seeing a therapist, but I’m not sure how effective she’s being. My doctor put me on an ant-depressant (Zoloft) but after just 4 days I got off because the side effects were too bad. Then the anxiety/insomnia got worse from there. I’ve gone whole nights without sleeping and it scares the shit out of me. My anxiety goes up when it’s close to bed time. Xanax is the only thing that works now, but I know I can’t take it for very long. I’m planning on getting a different job outside the house as I’m wondering if part of the problem is being inside all day by myself without any social interaction.

One strange thing I noticed is when I visit my dad in Orange County and stay a few nights, much of my anxiety disappears and I can sleep at night. Then when I drive back gone my anxiety immediately goes up. I don’t know if this is a case of home sickness. But I don’t want to move back nor can I afford to. I’m so tired of dealing with this.

When does it happen?,"Hi, I’m very new to this Reddit community and I’m hoping this question isn’t in violation of your guidelines.

Maybe it has to do with being more self aware, but I think that I’ve had anxiety for so long that I recognize the build up as a normal feelings or bodily responses. I’m also aware of how anxious I get about certain things, but it never prepares me for the explosion because I’m not sure of how to process it yet or look for the buildup.

Can health anxiety cause real pain and how do I help my partner if that is the case?,"Content Warning: Emotional Child Abuse (briefly) and various illnesses and injuries.

My partner has anxiety, though not diagnosed, a lot of it is focused on her health. She also comes from an abusive family where she was made to feel as though her genuine health problems, such as a hernia, were hallucinations and that she was crazy.

A few times I have noticed that she will begin worrying about something, and then later that day or the next day, will complain about said problem.

Most recently, she went for a run on Sunday morning, first time in a while. On the day, she said she had to stop the program of eight 1 minute runs a little early because she forgot to take her asthma pump before running. Later that evening she said she had a slight ache in her legs, and that was it. Last night she mentioned an event about 2 months ago where she had twisted her ankle and it was very painful. She was talking about how that pain might be caused by muscle problems, weak bones, some type of cancer. Then today, around midday, she tells me she is getting that same pain in her ankle though only the beginning stages so its not that bad yet. She hadn't mentioned feeling that at any time prior to midday Wednesday, since running Sunday morning. Ive done a fair amount of running in my life, and Ive never had a pain take that long to develop after a run.

That isnt to say I think she is making it up. Not at all. I'm just worried it could be caused be the anxiety somehow. Could worrying about it make her feel the pain? Could it be a mild twinge that she perceives as much worse? Could it be that by worrying, she unconsciously altered her gait to ease off the ankle, but in doing so has caused pain in the ankle? At the same time, it could very well be a physical problem causing the pain. Whether from running or something else. 

I don't know what to do. If it is caused by the anxiety, would going along with it be enabling the anxiety? (Which my research says is bad). But if it is a physical problem, questioning whether it is anxiety related brings up a lot of stress from the abuse from her parents, and also doesnt help fix the problem.

There was a service that allows you to just talk about your emotions and stuff you been dealing with to .. hear me out.. your crush you've always had, censentually but I mean like think about it, when I've talked to someone about my feelings when I had a big thing for them, it's the most breathtaking experienc :P they wouldn't even have to talk back, just listen to you so you feel known

Sometimes THERAPY isn't just having some coaching it's just being heard by someone listening to you 
And sometimes it feels like who you just want to listen to you, is someone you've liked and when you tell them your feelings it can also bring together a bonding friendship 

They couldn't say anything bad in the service if anything just listening to you And telling you it's alright, sometimes that's all you want is that special someone you always liked to just tell you.. it'll be alright  :)

I feel so guilty for not talking to my parents much,"I'm 22 and still live at home. My parents are super nice to me, too nice in fact. If they were horrible, i'd at least have an excuse for spending my life hiding away in my room. But they're not.

I feel so guilty for not talking to them much or having much of a relationship with them. But every time I go down and try make an effort i'm just so socially awkward and it makes me even more depressed so i just avoid the pain and spend my life in my room.

Social anxiety is just awful.," I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder a little over five years ago, at the age of 16. I had already strongly suspected it since throughout my childhood and early teenage years I was always shy and scared of social situations. I could never make friends unless someone talked to me first and it’s still like that to this day. 
 
 I strongly envy those who can talk to others with ease, who can make friends everywhere they go, who don’t feel sick during social situations. People have often told me that they thought I was a bitch or that I didn’t like them at first simply because I didn’t talk to them and/or during our initial conversations, I would speak in a quiet monotone. 

I truly wish I wasn’t like this. I wish I didn’t come across as a bitch, because most of the time, I’m just having anxious thoughts that are preventing me from acting how I want to. From being able to actually engage in good conversation and come across as someone with a friendly personality. If I try just a little bit to step out my comfort zone, I feel almost as if I’m going to pass out. Sometimes I mess up on my words or I stutter. It’s so embarrassing. I think so much and I say so little. :/

I just want to overcome this. The only things that help are alcohol and some other substances, but I know it’s not healthy to be doing those every day. It kind of sucks when I meet someone while intoxicated and meet them again when sober and they see this anxious, quiet individual who was nothing at all like the happy, fun girl they met. I wish I was that version of myself all the time and that I could find a way to bring out that part of me when sober. I’m currently in therapy for this, but it hasn’t been much help yet. 

I just think about too often how I could’ve had a bubbly, outgoing personality but instead was born with this one. I’ve spent far too much time envying those who have the personality I desire that it’s taken a significant toll on my mental health overall. Social anxiety is goddamn awful and I’ve missed many opportunities because of it. 

I just truly want to overcome it. I’m still young so there might be a chance but damn, I get anxiety simple thinking about attempting to work on it more. I don’t want to look like a fool and I don’t want people to think I’m weird. Idk.",moist-giraffes,26,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n54hc7/social_anxiety_is_just_awful/
Really want this shit to happen,"Well for the next 3 weeks ill be writing 3 tests per week and because I really want to raise my grades Im working my ass off , and really have that urge to work.Thing is that the plan behind this studying so hard and wanting to have good grades thing is that I really really want to study abroad.And universities abroad really want you to have good grades every year of high school.Something which really stresses me out because every bit matters here.Im also in the most praised high school in my area , where everyone is a straight A student and was a place I really wanted to get in just because I wanted to be in the same environment with such students.But while I study for these upcoming tests I tend to get enormously anxious about everything , I overthink and compare myself to the other students (Im dyslexic too so that makes it easier for my brain to find a niece way to make me feel bad about it when comparing myself to others).And just cant seem to make it stop.For the past 2 weeks of easter holiday I just feel this blend of confidence and self doubt all at once while thinking about the universities I really want to attend and get accept to and being really happy and thrilled by that feeling , and at the same time just completely crushing myself with self doubt.And im just so tired.",KruoSaligkari92,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5oeaa/really_want_this_shit_to_happen/
"It's very hard for me to even explain this symptom, but have any of you ever felt like you can't help but draw your visual attention to your peripheral vision for no reason?","Usually happens when I see something in my peripheral vision that's either shiny or moving ever so slightly. I first started having floaters in my vision and ""white dots"" in my peripheral vision about a month ago, I checked with an optometrist to see if they could see anything wrong with my eyes but they seem to be completely fine. 

Should I worry? It's kind of annoying, but the reason why I even brought it up in this sub is because I notice these symptoms go away once I'm focused doing something or talking to someone or whatever, and I've had many many weird physical symptoms of anxiety before, though this one would surprise me a bit since I haven't been anxious for a few months I'd say.",cratera666,1,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5oat7/its_very_hard_for_me_to_even_explain_this_symptom/
Post therapy session thoughts on my journey,"Hi! I just had a very good therapy session yesterday and I felt like reflecting a little on my journey. I thought I could share it here and check if anyone relate. Maybe it can help someone? I don't know ahah. 

I have an anxiety disorder. Diagnosed a year and a half ago, but I struggled with myself since puberty. I am 28, so while mental health was starting to be more known, I was raised by parents that didn't have all the tools to identify that I needed help. Since then, both my parents were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and my family now talks openly about this, medication, therapy. I have younger brothers and sisters (the yougest being 16 years younger than me), that seem to also struggle but are getting help right now. Which I find amazing!! 

I have always been fighting against myself, and trying to reach MY ideal. Someone who is happy most of the time, balanced, sexually active with my partner (I have a low libido due to my issue, medication, etc), the best of friend, the best sister, an accomplished professionnal in my field, etc. 

I saw (and still do to a certain extent) my anxiety as an obstacle to be the best version of me. I have lost friends and isolated myself at many different points in my life because it was too much. 

So, a year and a half ago, I get my first medication prescription. I started therapy last year. The initial goal was to get rid of my anxiety, work on who I want to be. 

I think that the biggest surprise for me was to get to the point where, yesterday, I expressed to my therapist how proud I was that I was able to now accept that the «ups» were not a permanent thing. That my mood is cyclical. In the last year, instead of becoming this person I want to be, I started getting to know myself better, be able to reflect on what happened after a bad month (by exemple). I started appreciating the good times as moments to be more social, be a more invovled partner, etc.  

I stopped talking about what I could be, who I will be, with my partner. I focus on how I am right now, and what I am trying to do to be at peace with myself.  I don't feel like fighting against ME anymore, I want to know me, I want to take care of me, and I want to love me in the moment. 

In the end, I am not becoming who I wanted to be. I am becoming much more counsious of who I am, what helps when Im having an anxiety attack, what are my limits, how to be patient with myself when I can't perform my many roles as well as I wish I could. 

Instead of clinging to the good times and be scared about the next bad one, I appreciate them much more.

Maybe I will always struggle with my mental health. Maybe that's a part of who I am. And that is okay. I am not meant to be the strongest, funniest, most involed and professionnal woman. I am me, and I am worthy of love, especially my own. 

Have a good day everyone :)",belleivresse,6,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5e4se/post_therapy_session_thoughts_on_my_journey/

The heat humidity constantly saps my energy.

has your anxiety ever validated the things it makes you fear?,"So today I was pretty much fine all day, but suddenly as I was looking through my notifications on my phone, I started to feel super sick to my stomach. I have emetophobia, so this caused a spike in anxiety in me and I started feeling very on edge and generally unwell. I tried to shake it off and went back in the living room to be around family members and distract myself. I continued scrolling through my phone and then learned about a passing of an acquaintance. My whole mind and body went from that panicky state to one of total numbness. I felt frozen in time, and all the sick feelings I had were replaced by this numbness. It was as if that sudden and random bout of anxiety was preparing me to learn about this awful news. Has this ever happened to anyone else before? And does it kinda freak you out? Because in a way it proves that there’s some type of rationality or reason behind my anxiety and that’s scary because every time I think my mind is just making me believe something bad is going to happen, there is a chance something bad has actually happened. I don’t know if any of this post made sense, but please let me know of your own experiences if you’ve had any!",Medium_Macaron_7933,12,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n59578/has_your_anxiety_ever_validated_the_things_it/
Does anyone else have health anxiety?,"I’m 19F. 

Whenever I’m very stressed in life, I tend to obsess about anything or anyone around me, including myself. 

There’s been times I thought I had gastritis, apendicitis, PCOS, hirsutism, every STD that has every existed, COVID-19, and rabies. 

I even thought my ex was gay (I’m all for LGBTQ+ and have no problem, I was just afraid of not being loved). 

I used to be scared to be a lesbian (which I’m not, I turned out to be bisexual) as well. 

It’s also happened where I was worried that I’ll have a family one day and that my husband would be a closeted pedophile and harm my children. 

What I’m trying to say is, I basically obsess about everything! It drives me nuts and won’t let me sleep at night. I’m always hungry for research and evidence to prove me right or wrong. My latest obsession is that my bf could have a personality disorder. Thankfully I caught myself in my tracks and noticed I do this type of thing every time I’m stressed. 

I’m an alcoholic and I stopped just this Sunday and hope to remain sober as well. I just want to know I’m not alone on how I feel and I hope you guys can give helpful advice on how to stop these thoughts from flooding my head.",binkidink,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5o568/does_anyone_else_have_health_anxiety/

Help! I can’t get my words out.,"So, I’ve come into an issue recently where I’m finding myself really struggling to speak/express myself (especially during work meetings). I find myself either stammering or unable to get the words out entirely. I have a slight stammer when stressed or nervous but it’s never been this bad. It makes me worried that people won’t be able to take me seriously/think I’m not being honest/think I am confused because I’m just struggling to speak when that isn’t the case. Sometimes I just decide to be silent/not chime in because I’m terrified of randomly not being able to get any words out. I actually still have a lump in my throat from a meeting that just ended about 20 mins ago because it was so hard for me to literally say “bye” to leave the call. I don’t know if it’s social anxiety or what. I’m thinking about maybe turning on my camera for work calls - that might be able to help me at least see myself (if no one else has their camera on) which may lessen anxiety. Speaking into a screen for over a year now may be taking its toll. 

Any advice would be helpful.",Royal-Improvement-33,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5ncxy/help_i_cant_get_my_words_out/

Anxiety has taken over my life,"My anxiety has gotten so bad to the point where I feel like I need to leave society and become isolated somewhere in order to stop all the panic attacks I’ve been having.

This morning was absolutely terrible. I was struggling with logging onto my laptop for work (work is a trigger!), I work from home. It took an hour of me painstakingly sitting there messaging the charity Shout and speaking to a friend that I only managed to load up my work calendar towards 10am, I didn’t know what to do, other than cry and feel like it’s never going to get better. You can give me reassurances but I feel like I need someone to physically hold me and tell me it’s okay. 

I ended up telling 2 of my colleagues if they can cover some of my work this morning as I’m not “feeling well”. I have to log in at 2 for meetings and some work that needs to be submitted by 4:30pm.

what i have learned,"i have always struggled with anxiety. whether it was when i was eight and worried about not sleeping, 10 and scared about throwing up, or this past year when i was crippled by my own thoughts of my health. this past year, i have suffered from worried about many health issues. heart attacks, strokes, tumour ect. the worst was was a fear of anaphylactic shock and my throat closing. i barley ate anything for weeks because i thought i was allergic. that was in the summer and now i have been on the journey to recovering by medication and new strategies. laying on my dads carpeted floor at 4am on my hands and knees saying goodbye to my family members (i thought i was suffocating) shaking and turning white in the face was really a wake up call to get some medication. some things i have learned is breathing is so so important. realizing something is wrong and breathing slow and deep is helpful. talking, a lot is helpful for me. realizing other people struggle with this also has helped me not feel alone. seeing my father go through this same thing broke me, and made me think of how upset my mother was watching me go through this. learning to be more realistic and to think “rational thoughts” as my mom says. thinking these thoughts are okay, and you just have to ride the wave untill it passes. taking my mind off things when these thoughts pop up suddenly. of course, they never used to be just thoughts. they used to spiral, and cause me into a raving panic. i couldn’t do it alone anymore. medication has made my life feel like a life again. my family, my boyfriend; the people i love most got me through it.

I'm a loser," 

I (27F) am feeling more down than usual.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so here I am.

I work at a call center for a bank. I make less than $50K a year. I get cursed out, screamed at, and called the most disgusting names, but I cant quit. Its all I have. Its enough to barely support me and my cat. Its getting to the point where after each call, I'm hyperventilating and on the verge of tears. My only friend moved to Japan 3 years ago, and our relationship has been hard to maintain considering the time difference and the fact that we both work 40 hour weeks. We are at the point where we send each other random tiktoks, or like each others FB post but that's about it.

I have a twin sister, but every time we talk she just likes to brag about how rich her husband is and how she doesn't have to work. She's even told me to try getting on dating sites to find someone who can take care of me like she did, but dating sites don't work for me. My anxiety has gotten worse from this job. I tried to find hobbies but they never really stick. I wanted to stream online because i like video gamming, but I cant afford the equipment. Of course i mentioned this to my twin sister, telling her my ideas, my aesthetic and how i wanted to have my stream set and, she immediately went out to buy the supplies to rub it my face. Now she streams online for twitch making almost $700 a month using the EXACT aesthetic and methods i mentioned to her. Now I'm unmotivated to do it. I cant top what she's done with my ideas. I don't see her of my niece and nephew because she lives an hr away, and refuses to come see anyone.

My other sister (23F) is a dancer. She's beautiful, skinny and can easily make $1300 a night, which has opened so many doors for her. She's traveling, appearing in music videos and is even getting booked for celebrity parties. She always jokes that i can do it too but I'm fat, and again- severe anxiety. I don't see her as much because she's always booked.

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. This job sucks, its killing my mood, and giving me crippling depression and anxiety, but i cant seem to find another job with the pay that'll support me. I don't have any hobbies to busy my mind, or any extra money to invest in a hobby so i usually find myself crying, sleeping and working. OH- I've also picked up drinking. hooray, i might be an alcoholic too.

Some things i am proud of is the fact that I've been able to keep this job for as long as i have without either 1) quitting on a whim and 2) finally cursing out one of the customers and getting fired. I've noticed that the depression and anxiety is getting worse. I've dropped 30lbs in the last few months, lost a pretty good amount of hair, and i stopped caring what I looked like. I don't have anyone i can talk to but my cat and I'm sure he's tired of me at this point. My mom and i have never been close and my dad left us when we were younger. 

TBH im very lonely and depressed. I self harm sometimes and I've thought about killing myself but didnt want to be a burden to my landlord for smelling up his unit with my corpse.

So I discovered a mistake the 3rd party made and sent what I feel now is a condescending email expecting corrections today on their part.  Yes,  SOMEONE in their organization made a mistake but my email is not my normal tone and in the past they’ve bent over backwards to help us (their client) out.  I’m regretting sending that email out &amp; in my anxiety mode will apologize profusely if they call.  I really hate blaming others.  I also hate my boss who would fall on a sword rather than admit fault.  Am I becoming my boss?

Anxiety when a family member gets a phone call,"Hey beautiful people,

so I tried to find discussions to this topic but all I find is phone phobia related. That's not it, I don't mind phone calls myself. But whenever one of my family members gets a call I hold my breath and can't concentrate on my work (I'm 25 and currently living with my parents again due to..youknowwhat).

I just immediately get scared that they are confronted with bad news of any sort. I notice every pause and every slight change in their voice and my heart starts racing. Once they hang up I rush into the room and subtly try to find out what that call was about. And even if they say ""nothing important"" I create the worst case scenarios. Can anyone relate in any way?

I just had to share this with someone and maybe I'd feel better knowing I am not alone.

Getting over the fact that there's no one close to me again,"Hey, I made 2 posts recently (only posts on this acc) where I expressed my current issue. Reading them will give you a lot more detailed info about my anxiety regarding this, but the TL;DR version is that I just asked someone I like to stay only friends because I'm not sure I'll be able to love him in the future as much as he loves me now.

As you probably know, anxiety doesn't just stop there. I'm still worried how we'll be able to manage this (if we can, at all), but I also started to think back to past friendships, and it just hit me that I lost all of my 3 closest friends this year (they are either too busy or also have personal or mental health issues and stopped contacting me), and I just had to push away the only person who I could rely on lately. Yes, this latter one was my choice, but that doesn't make it easier to deal with because I do like him more than a friend, I just can't cope with the amount of anxiety my unsure feelings for him give me and I didn't want to hurt him either to just lead him on when I'm not sure about things.

Are there people out there who feel/felt the same? Like you just have no luck finding and keeping people close to you because of different reasons?
I was relatively okay after my closest friend left me and I had to learn how to rely only on myself, but now that I experienced how is it like to be truly cared for again, it just knocked me down to realize I have to build myself up again, and honestly it makes me demotivated to find someone who I can be close to because it's tiring to think about fully opening up to someone who will eventually leave me.

Again, the above mentioned guy is a different situation, I don't blame him for anything, it's my lack of romantic feelings that got in the way there. What I want to express is that I had no friends around me to help me deal with this amount of anxiety, and even though he was there for me, it wasn't much of a help for an avoidant anxious person like me who just ""wants"" to push the source of my anxiety away.

For a few weeks before meeting him, I had pals who I occasionally chatted or played with, and I honestly didn't mind not building a stronger friendship with them, it was good to have casual buddies for when I didn't want to be alone. But right now I just feel like something has been cut out of me again - even though it was my decision with him and we do have some potential to be only friends, but I still need some break from him (which I told him already).

Sorry for this mess of a post, it's pretty therapeutic to write things out of myself, but I'm also keen to get some advice regarding my situation and how to go forward from here. I'm sure I need days or even a week to be able to function normally and think more clearly, time is definitely gonna help me in the long run, but right now I'm still not sure if this was the right decision with him or not, and if I even want to be close to someone again - let it be a friend or something more.",anxiety___throw,3,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5cunf/getting_over_the_fact_that_theres_no_one_close_to/
"Globus sensation: feeling of a lump in the throat, anyone?","So, this time on my recent anxiety crisis it seems I got what is called a Globus Sensation. It has been 3 weeks since I first noticed it, with some days where it was almost completely gone, but most days with this annoying persistent feeling.  
  
It started one day before my first therapy, so it has been 3 therapy sessions, and it has been one week since I went to the psychiatrist and started medication (Escitalopram for long term anxiety and depression, and Quetamine for quick anxiety fix).  
  
Last week was tough, it used to be gone after taking a tea before sleep but now it persists even when trying to sleep. Saturday was the worst day, I tried to distract myself by going to a park with my girlfriend and her son and just spiraled down into anxiety and almost suffocated with this shit. Decided to not sleep on her apartment and went to visit my parents.  
  
I cried a lot, talked a lot with my father, and woke up better. Spent the whole Sunday and part of Monday without it (like 90% better).  
  
But yesterday night and today it is back, and it is annoying and distracting as fuck.  
  
I know the medication can take 4, maybe 6 weeks to have full effect, and that even Im not feeling that anxious anymore symptoms can appear and persist. I'm just a little bit frustrated this symptom returned, but hopeful it can disappear in the next weeks.  
  
This symptom is just crazy. I mean, all anxiety symptoms are crazy because they mess with your body in real ways even though it is just your mind and body acting crazy. But this feeling of something stuck in your throat, or that your throat is tense which makes it smaller, and then you just feel the walls of it touching each other even when not swallowing, it feels so REAL, how can I not ""remove"" what is there (an ENT will look and will see nothing wrong), and how is it going to go away out of nowhere? I mean, it basically dissappeared for a day so it must be psychological. Crazy stuff.

"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!","(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears.

Anxiety always peaks right before menstrual 😫,"Today sucked. Last night I was waking up all night confused, I’d sit straight up and my eyes wouldn’t focus then I’d fall back to sleep over and over and over again. I think I forgot to breathe once which also woke me up. I knew today was gonna be pretty bad. First sign, as usual, is the tingling in my hands and feet... it’s been all day and it’s sooooo annoying. Then I get this weird vibration feeling all throughout my body. I’ve been fighting off a panic attack all day and I’ve done really good. Convincing myself that all of the weird sensations are just my anxiety helps to keep my mind straight. I’m still fighting the panic attack off and I’m praying I can sleep tonight... I’m always afraid to sleep when I’m feeling this way.

That's new for me.,"I had an uncomfortable situation, got nervous, couldn't talk, had a complete blank mind, felt the blood in my hears rushing, cramped completely, realized that nothing is real, sat it through, then ran out of the room as soon as I was allowed to do so, sat on a bathroom floor, breathed heavily, had a racing heart, took a few moments, survived it.

So, since when is it possible to just sit still and then suddenly burst it all out maybe half an hour after the actual incident and feel worse than in the situation?

Coping mechanisms for dealing with loud neighbors,"I have an upstairs neighbor who has been generally loud with his bass-heavy music (he has a subwoofer) and his gaming (on the nights he games, he'll yell randomly throughout the night). I live in NYC. He moved in 2 months ago and immediately started playing bass-heavy music very loudly on a regular basis. After about two weeks of that, I went up to his place and asked him to turn the music down since the music that night was especially loud. He mentioned his bass was turned up and that he would turn it down (which it seemed he did). 

In the weeks since, I've actually noticed an improvement in the noise level compared to those early days and I'm guessing he's making an attempt to be more neighborly and respectful. However, there are still times where he listens to his music loudly for about an hour or shouts during his gaming. Again, this isn't a daily occurrence and happens maybe 3-4 days a week at these short bursts. Sometimes he does this after 10pm but not often.

I'm starting to learn how to cope (headphones) and luckily the noise does not creep into my bedroom (so I haven't lost sleep over this, thankfully) but I'm just wondering what kind of tips you may have for dealing with the anxiety that comes with this. I often find myself on edge when he is home, waiting for the moment he turns on his stereo. I don't want to move because I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a desirable NYC neighborhood.

For those who have dealt with something similar, what kind of coping mechanisms have you adopted to get used to this? Perhaps it's reframing thinking, meditation, etc?",jnguy001,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5j2od/coping_mechanisms_for_dealing_with_loud_neighbors/
Dating with anxiety?,"Hi everyone!
So my anxiety flared up extremely bad during the pandemic. I wasn’t able to socialize with anyone and it brought me to a very low place. I finally started speaking to a therapist and it has helped so much. She really pushes me to go and do things which has helped so much! I have even gotten to the point where I can talk to random people at a bar without being in a full on panic! This leads me to talk about dating with anxiety!

Pre-pandemic I was able to literally meet up with people I met on tinder or just talk to anyone. Now the thought of even driving to a date or them picking me up makes me feel uncomfortable. Does anyone have any suggestions? How do you tell them you have anxiety with the occasional panic attack?

I’m sorry if this seems like a silly thing to think about, but I’m a 23 year old that eventually wants to meet the one (I’m not in a rush, but I do think about how it will happen when I can’t even talk to a person romantically).

Sudden panic attacks for the first time.,"Hello everyone, hope you're well. For the first time in my life a couple days ago, i experienced what could only be described as a panic attack. Heart racing, feeling like it's gonna burst, anxiety and fear rising to such a level i wanted to cry. It came out of nowhere, i was just sitting down and noticed my heart rate increase and for some reason, this got me into a panic and it only got worse from there. For the next 3-4 hours my heart rate went up and down, finally stabilizing enough for me to get to sleep. 

This event kinda traumatized me, and now when something startles me or triggers my anxiety, my heart rate rises and i notice it and it get's me even more anxious, thus my heart rate once again goes crazy. So my question is, can experiencing one panic attack flick a switch so to speak and you are now susceptible no more panic attacks in the future? I'm going to try and see a doctor this week about it, i just wanted to let it off my chest as it scares me.",DirectorPhleg,1,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5j03t/sudden_panic_attacks_for_the_first_time/
I feel guilty for leaving anxiety.,"I don't know how can I begin writing this post. In short, part of the abuse as a kid led me to think that life is ugly, extremely bad and that everything is super complicated. I constantly live in my head and I can't get out of my thoughts, almost as if they try to protect me from what's happening right in front of me: as if the process of life is constantly painful. I feel guilty because the same people who told me that life is difficult made me feel shameful that I was doing ""bad"" and a disgrace basically.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't say who they are (you probably already know) but one of those people was a big narcissist who led me to believe everything is hyper complicated, that living life in a normal way without having so many worries was unrealistic and that trusting people was bad. I feel like trying to see life as a great opportunity to experience something calm and wonderful is unrealistic and egocentric, because I'm ""ignoring the truth"", as if I want to make life easier than it is and that I'm a disgrace of a lazy asshole

&amp;#x200B;

As if I have to constantly be hypervigilant of everyone and everything. I tried to just be in the present moment and actually let myself experience life, but the cloud of thoughts seem to take control. Anyone feels the same way? Like, living the pain is something ""bad to do""?

tl:dr: when I try to believe that life is more peaceful and easy than I always tend to think with that anxiety I feel guilty because I remember that people who abused me make me feel as if life is extremely hard and that I'm basically a piece of shit who wants everything to be more easy because I'm a lazy dumbass.

(trigger warning) Why doesn't my friend listen to me when i mean it,"I'm a normal person. I like to make jokes every once and a while. 

I like to make people laugh and be their friend.

But there are times where i cross the line.


So there was a project for our P.E class that we would record ourselves dancing/exercising to music and it would be done in groups. And they would compile every video of members into one.

I got paired with my friend, I talk to them everyday. 

So when I sent them my video, I first asked to not laugh at it because I'm sensitive and I would later ruminate about it and it makes me feel like I'm going crazy. Also I asked to not give it to other people

She 'promised' not to.

Yet she still did.

I HATE EVERYTHING, WHY DID I EVEN BELIEVE SUCH THING. IM SO STUPID. I HATE MYSELF.

Later, I recieve a text from her friend. He said he 'liked the video' of me and texted me ""idol😍😍😍🥰🥰♥️❤️❤️"" which was obviously a joke.


I later explained why I want him to stop, He finally understood. 

FINALLY SOMEONE THAT LISTENS TO ME! WHAT LUCK I HAVE.

*

And just a few hours ago, My female friend who I sent the video to, Sent the video again to me and said haha's and a voice message of her laughing.


I fxxking hate this
I fxxking hate myself for trusting someone. Even if they are my friend.


I know some people are gonna say ""well its just a joke they dont mean it""

Well to me it does. It hurts. It makes me feel like sh*t. The one I thought i could trust, Made fun of me, made me feel like trash, made me feel ugly and fat.


I tried explaining to her that I want her to stop.


She just laughed
And laughed
And laughed 

Not giving a damn about what I feel 

I WANT TO EXPLAIN IT SO MY ANXIETY DOESN'T GET WORSE SO I'M NOT GOING TO THE POINT I WANT TO KILL MYSELF.


I JUST WANT MYSELF TO FEEL FINE, THE REASON I BEFRIENDED YOU WAS BECAUSE YOU MADE ME LAUGH, AND I MADE YOU LAUGH.


AND NOW, YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE MY PROBLEMS SERIOUS. 

WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM? 

YES, I MAKE JOKES FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT FEEL ANGER AND SADNESS.

AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO RIP MY HEART OUT.


ANXIETY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU MAKE FUN OF, AND THAT IS A FACT.

IF SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING, DON'T JUST SIT THERE AND THINK ITS A JOKE.

DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE JUST SAD.

THEY ARE SUFFERING LITTLE BY LITTLE EVERYDAY.

IF YOU ARE THEIR CLOSE ONE, ATLEAST DO SOMETHING TO HELP AND TAKE THEM SERIOUS.

JOKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY TO THE ONES WHO HAS IT BAD, CAN MAKE THEM COMMIT S*IC*DE.

BE A GOOD FRIEND, AND BE THERE FOR THEM. LIKE THEY WERE THERE FOR YOU.



... she's my best friend, yet doesn't take me seriously. She makes me laugh, plays online games with me, helps me with homework.

I do the same.

But why

Why do I not get treated the same.

When she's feeling down, I'm there for her.

Yet when I'm serious, she just laughs at me.

First panick attack (trigger for substance use),"I was ending a 24 hours shift. I went home an had the great idea of eating an edible given that I lost the will to sleep for some reason.

 I ate it, decided to sleep (I forgot to put my phone I  airplane mode). I was being waking up by texts, calls which I was ignoring, but I received one text about some money I had to give to someone. 

I go out (1 block from home) and I get to the place I could sent money from.

When I get to my house I realized it was a panic attack and that's when, after thinking to call someone there's just wasn't someone who I think I'm close enough, I just texted like 2 people. 

I let them know I was okay but I was going through the panic attack and I was starting to feel normal. I then convinced myself that this couldn't kill me, just made me think it could, and then I went back.

The part when I realized I couldn't call anyone was kind of depressing, and I now know I've repressed so much because I don't trust anyone enough.

(TW: loss of loved one) How do you heal from repression of the loss of a loved one?,"Main issues: 
Heavy repression
Fear of loss intruding into my current relationship 

So I lost my mum about 7 years back, when I was 18 years old. 

I was never really the kind to get really emotional. I was always social &amp; energetic but admittedly, I do have some excessive people-pleaser traits. 

Crying isn't natural to me but I was open to it. Losing a parent was a sad enough event to allow myself to cry. After I lost my mum, there was a huge fight within 2 sides of the family in regards to her burial, and I didn't have the space, time &amp; freedom to be emotional or cry. Instead I had to be as tough as I ever could because I was in the middle of all it and the primary decision-maker. 

By the time that was all settled, I had no drive to cry, be emotional or wanna react to her passing anymore. It's as if I was too late to react normally. I didn't feel anything. And that's how it was for the next 6 years. I never really felt anything looking back at her passing, I could talk about it candidly and my closest friends always found it weird how I never spoke about my mum but it was simply because the issue never seemed to surface to me consciously. I was... unknowingly then, emotionally numb to it. There was no feelings attached. It was just an event that happened. 

Up until the recent times, in 2020, I started to feel like I missed her just a little when I entered a down period in my life. And then, my next caretaker, who's been with us for a decade, had to leave us to return to her country and I was mega depressed. We were like best friends, siblings and she was such an amazing anchor of stability in my life. But weeks later, same thing. Numb. I live life at the present as though she doesn't exist. When she calls me every now &amp; then, I can easily dismiss her calls and say ""I'm busy, call me another time"" and be super apathetic toward it with no thoughts or feelings of remorse.

Recently I got into a relationship and my ""fear of loss"" anxiety manifested rapidly and started projecting on my partner. I would walk on eggshells when it comes to avoiding topics she's uncomfortable with or doesn't like, I'd think of every single way to pander to her needs and I'm hyper attentive to when she talks about her likes &amp; dislikes, even her reactions to things. And I'm always begging for repeated reassurances and I can never feel secure despite her expressing in every humanly possible way that she loves me so much and is not going to leave me (and not in an idealistic way, but she also does discuss the realities of relationships and not promising forever which I concur with) 

I can't stay secure for even 3 days in a row and I'm always irrationally scared of losing her. 

As I reflected recently and allowed my emotions to flow, it went from ""why do I always need to please people? What happens if I don't please them or meet their expectations? I would feel like a complete failure. (I asked myself why, it didn't know an answer but I started screaming and throwing over furniture in my own head and a few minutes later my mind said) I'm so tired of losing people!!! (I started thinking of my mum, my caretaker, a girl that ghosted me when it seemed we were getting along during my depression period when my caretaker left) and that's when I realised that that's where it came from and I have repressed so much.

I don't really know what to do now, honestly. It's been 7 years. I really don't want to keep feeling like I'm walking on eggshells just to talk to my girlfriend, getting anxious whenever I reply her and she's not actively there, and also this affecting my mood so badly and affecting my mental health whenever I get into simple conflicts with any of my close friends. 

I'm tired and I wanna know how to move on from here and I need advice.
(I'm already seeing a counsellor so that step is done but I don't know if I have the emotional capability to cry in front of him by sharing super vulnerably even if I tried cause of the numbed emotions, and also I barely have any close friends who I can find a safe space to cry with them in. So, idk man.)",Haknah,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5cyti/tw_loss_of_loved_one_how_do_you_heal_from/
why does no one understand..?,"I have been feeling off for the majority of the day. Even as i write this now i’m laying down in bed cause it’s the only place i feel semi normal or alright.
I was freaking out and having a panic attack just before because the right side of my face/forehead and head itself felt ... odd... wrong. I can’t explain it much more than that. It felt numb and almost like i can’t control anything on that side properly. 
I know it’s my anxiety (least i hope so) but it still makes me panic just the same. 
It makes me feel like i’m going to have a stroke or seizure.. blood clot.. i don’t know just something. 
Anyway - i asked my mum to come sit on my bed with me and talk to me because she’s done it before a couple of times and it helped. 
My panic attacks have only been going on for a couple months but i can already tell she’s sick of it and of me. 
Tonight she got angry at me and sat on my bed and proceeded to yell in my face saying i don’t help myself and no one can feel as sorry for me as i do for myself - and so on.
She said i don’t do anything to change this... i don’t do enough exercise or go out etc.
I feel like i do try. But it’s hard. 

95% of the time i don’t feel good. 
Infact it’s actually hard to remember the last time i did feel good or even “ok”. Most days i’m honestly just spending them trying to get through till the next one and it’s a struggle. 
I just don’t understand why i’m like this and why people around me have to be like that as well. 
All i want is to get better and i’m terrified of taking medication as i already suffer from a few things that they have side effects of and i don’t want to make those worse.

i’m not really sure what i’m looking for by typing all this.. i just needed somewhere to talk where people won’t get angry at me. thanks -",comfortablesolace,2,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n5cyqi/why_does_no_one_understand/

How do I overcome this anxiety?,"Hi,

I hope you're all well. Global pandemics have really put the cat amongst the pigeons for a lot of people's mental health, particularly anxieties, so I'll take this chance before I write my question to remind everyone that you are not alone.

I've been anxious for a long-time. The way I feel is nowhere near as bad as some, although it is becoming a major inconvenience in my life. I am okay 75% of the time, but then minor incidents (for example, why has someone read a text and not replied?) can spark big and quick spirals (are they talking about me? there was that time I did XYZ, are they all going to tell me they don't want to be my friend anymore?). Then I'll be left incapable of doing anything (will sit in bed, sleep a lot, etc.) either until the situation resolves (I get a reply) or until enough time passes that I calm down (double digit hours for minor events, weeks for bigger events).

Simply put, I'm struggling to live like this and it appears to only be getting worse. It has started to impact every area of my life and is seeping out to the people around me.  


1. How do I define what I am feeling? I'm not asking for a medical diagnosis by any stretch of the imagination. But, if you feel similar here, how do you describe it to people around you?  

2. How do I make this better? I'm happy to walk a long-road to achieve this and I'm not expecting any silver bullets that make this all okay by the weekend. I've taken a lot of preventative measures. For example, I drink a lot less now. Does anyone have books they would recommend? Or techniques they learnt that helped?

Thanks a lot - I appreciate your time reading this. I know I'm not the first person to ask for help, but I didn't want to hijack another thread!

Please Help: Post-Engagement Anxiety &amp; Post Wedding Blues Anxiety,"Why the hell am I having so much anxiety and doubt with the person I love so much?

Is it anxiety or something else,"I have this thing happen to me every so often where (usually at work) I feel out of control of something going on. Its hard to describe. But basically any time that I feel completely overwhelmed or our of control, I get in my head too much and cant handle it.

The physical symptoms usually are limited to sweating/shakiness. But the mental symptoms are what are worse for me. Its like I cant communicate correctly with other people, and constantly second guess my ability to do anything in that moment without screwing it up. I try my best to push through it, but its really, really hard sometimes. It feels like a mental foggy head high, but totally unpleasant.

Its almost like I'm so ""in my head"" that everything else is secondary. Normal behavioral patterns are gone and all I can think about is trying to maintain my composure and not appear to be having any sort of anxiety attack.

To give you an example, I'm a cook by trade, and I work in very prestigious restaurants. Today I was making a recipe I'd never made before which was relatively complicated, and I screwed up part of it and had to re-do it. Just the act of screwing it up triggered this in my brain and I started sweating and not being able to concentrate on things the way I normally would. Most people might not know but as a professional cook, I often have many, many tasks all going on at the same time, and if one of them goes off balance, it can easily throw something else off.

In terms of 1-10 today's was probably a 8 which is the worst as of recently. There is only one other time a few months ago where I had (what i think was) an anxiety attack at work and it followed me home too, it was basically a 10/10-- and again it was a time where I was assigned a task that I was unfamiliar with and thought I wasn't doing it fast enough.

I'm just curious if this sounds like anxiety or something different? Ultimately I should seek out a psychologist I'm sure, because it isn't sustainable for me to feel this way long term. It's just hard to find time with my schedule, and expensive.",football2k,4,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n57kdi/is_it_anxiety_or_something_else/
Need some help with test anxiety.,"Hey everyone, hope you're having a good day. 
I don't really know where else I can ask, so I'm asking for advice/help here. 
I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by a doctor last September. Been on medication till the last month when my parents decided to cut off the treatment and now I'm on homepathic meds. 
I can safely state that triggers to my anxiety are timed tests. 
Last September I gave one of the most toughest exams to get into uni and that's when the anxiety attacks started. I messed up that exam, but I still got into one of the premier colleges in my country. 
After clg started, I've been having an anxiety attack during every single exam I've taken. What I've learnt isn't reflecting in this grades I'm getting and even the meds aren't working on me, both the meds the previous doctor gave and the current homeopathy meds. Because of me Messing up every exam, my grades are dropping and I don't really know what to do.. apart from usual college studies I need to learn extra skills too but anxiety again interferes and I'm just not learning anything new because of the fear that I won't be good. I'm starting to actually get SCARED of the moment when I'll have an anxiety attack. I avoid everything wanting to just relax and calm my nerves down but that just adds to the anxiety again. I'm finding it hard to have ONE waking moment when I'm at peace. I feel all this will improve if I just stop having anxiety attacks during an online exam.

"16 years old, please help.","Well after my classmate died 3 weeks ago I was so nervous my heart was beating so fast and after that, I'm barely breathing still, I had a stabbing sharp pain on the left side but I can say that I got rarely any stabbing pain now. I'm 16 years old never smoked, never drank alcohol, eating healthy, everyday vegetables, fruits I didn't eat any sort of junk food for 2 years but now I will give myself i break to eat ice cream lol, exercise 6 times a week (calisthenics/weightlifting). 

I did EKG, blood pressure, blood test, microbiology blood test, 2 docs listened to my heart and lungs, covid test negative, 99% blood oxygen, urine test... And it looks like I got health anxiety after all that. My heart is beating a little faster and my palms are sweaty I mean I always had sweaty palms(i have been always a little bit nervous but the nervousness will go away after I exercise or after I do something to occupy my mind). 

Now I started doing some kind of breathing exercise I read here on Reddit that one dude said.

And he said this too:

""First off it may be because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. The other reason being that your body over breathes when stressed out to get ready for the ""fight or flight"" response. People with anxiety find themselves under constant stress so if you continue to over-breathe over a prolonged period, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as ""normal"". The best way to fight this is to actively try and reduce the amount of air you breathe"".

increasing fear of getting dressed and going outside," **tw: ed; panic attacks**

for context, I have several crippling mental illnesses that keep me from attending school or work, the only regularity in my life is my therapist.

So I've always been on the more self-deprecating side, but recently it has gotten out of hand. Dressing more alternative was always something that made me feel good and safe and it kept me from worrying too much about how I look since I could objectively say that I have a nice fit.

But recently it has just gone away: I hate getting dressed and styling outfits has turned into a pointless game since in the end I will hate every part of my appearance and stay at home in pajamas instead. I tried getting new clothes or changing my style, but nothing helps. Instead, I get regular 3-4 days of disordered eating, leaving me weaker and more anxious than before. it's not like I don't like my clothes, especially my shirts (pants are very problematic), I just don't like them on me.

A while ago my mum forced me to get my meds from the pharmacy and I had a panic attack for like 2 hours

I wanted to share what I do to make my anxiety go away. It really helps guys.,"I have had really bad anxiety + depression for about 10 years. After doing this exercise, it has almost all gone away completely. No taking any medication either! Please try it out, I really think it can help!!
_____

1. Okay so, sit cross legged on the floor. Back straight.
 Eyes closed. Hands in the praying pose. Good posture. Face forward. 

2. Take deep breaths from your nose, hold it, and exhale from your mouth. Focus your thoughts only on your breathing and imagine the air coming in to your body. Imagine it circulating in your brain as you hold it. Imagine it leaving your body with all your negativity alongside it, as you exhale. The time it takes to breathe should equal the time it takes to exhale. Try and hold for 8 seconds - longer if you can. 

3. Inevitably there will be other thoughts and noise that might be intrusive, and will divert your attention from your breathing. You’ll stop thinking of your breaths and instead on your thoughts. Don’t get mad and try to mute them. Accept them and again divert your attention back to your breathing. I try to look down at my nose when my eyes are closed when I can’t focus on my breathing. Keep yourself in the present. Divert your attention away from past thoughts and future anxiety.

4. Going to be hard at first to bring your attention to your breaths since there’s so many other thoughts, but keep at it. After a few times / sessions, it just comes easier. At first I couldn’t focus at all. I would think “Wow. Am I really sitting here meditating? How dumb is this. What a waste of time."" But now - I can meditate while I walk or watch tv or do anything!

Objective: the past is the past and the future is just anxiety. **Focus on only the present**… Which is your breathing. That is the goal of these exercises. To bring your attention and mind back to your breathing , which is just the present state of what you are doing. We don’t care about what happened in the past, or what might happen in the future. Only thing that matters is how awesome it is to breathe and take long deep breaths and feel that sensation in your body.

Then in the future, when you get depressed or anxious about something, you have a trained mind to bring your thoughts back to the present state, instead of past or future. That is mind control, or mindfulness and it is the way! I hope this helps somebody out!

"Anxiety, work and resentment","My anxiety seems to skyrocket at work.  I often make excuses to old friends why I don't seem to progress at work.  I disclosed my condition to my boss, which he has been supportive of.  The anxiety usually arises with conflict.

I take an antidepressant to help manage the symptoms.  And I've read countless CBT books and been to therapy in the past.  I've been more or less stable the past few years.  It was much worse when I worked in previous jobs.   How do folk not harbour resentment or bitterness to work situations or people that made you ill in the past?  Do you sometimes feel different and misunderstood?

The root of my anxiety is probably innate, growing up with a mother with bad depression and alcoholism, and a narcissistic father.

Can folk with anxiety or anxiety like symptoms function in highly stressful jobs?   I know two other sufferers who pretty much dedicate their spare time to spiritual enlightenment just to cope.  Both have big mortgages and families to support.  I'd like to have a house and family.  But seeing these people has made me very hesitant to commit to something like this.

Am I afraid to be happy?,"Am I afraid to be happy?

So a little back story. Me 21F and my partner 22M have been together for 5 years. Our relationship is healthy, loving and we do work extremely well. The only thing is that I’ve always suffered massively from anxiety more specifically in the last 2 years health anxiety and well he is a very happy and positive person that very rarely feels anxious or depressed but  still knows how to comfort me in difficult times. 

So fast forward to today and I’m doing amazing on the Health anxiety front, I’m not worrying/obsessing over my health anymore and I can finally say my mind is clear of those things. The last 6 months have been the worst in regards to that and I hate to say that it did take its toll on my relationship, he felt like he couldn’t help me, I was always in a horrible state of worry and panic to the point it crippled me and in the end turned out to be making my partner extremely unhappy. We nearly broke up. He said he thought I needed some help and that if this carried on for much longer he doesn’t want it to change the we he feels about our relationship. This conversation we had really opened my eyes to how this anxiety was effecting my
life, my relationship, my work and even family so I promised to go and talk to my doctor and I did. I was prescribed Zoloft and I’m still waiting for the counselling but I’m in such a better place mentally and feel so much clear minded now and my relationship has been thriving like it did before. 

The only thing now tho is I’m starting to develop abit of anxiety around the fact that my partner makes me so happy and my life right now feels so happy to the point it makes me nervous and almost makes it feel suspicious and I’m noticing that I’m trying to find things that are wrong even when they are not, like maybe how my partner might say or do something and I’m like “is he still happy? And is he just not telling me that he’s not?” Or if someone even talks in a different tone or says something they wouldn’t normally say I’m thinking way to far into things thinking that those things point to something awful.

"I'm having really bad anxiety over submitting my notice at work. I already chickened out today, so it has to happen tomorrow.","This is a long one, I just needed to get it all out lol. TLDR is at the bottom if you get bored.

After being laid off due to Covid for the better part of a year, I finally landed a job about 2 months ago. Let me just preface by saying that employers have ALWAYS been impressed with my work, and I'm still close with 2 of my former bosses. I'm not what you'd call a problem employee. But this job is easily the worst I've ever had and it's eating me alive.

I was mislead about the salary, hours, and responsibilities, I received 0 training, everything I do is criticized but I never get any feedback on how to be better, I get snide remarks on the daily, and I have to listen to my coworkers get shouted at on a weekly basis by my boss (luckily he hasn't directed that behaviour at me yet). I started looking for a new job after my second day of work. This is all a long way  of saying I have no remorse whatsoever about leaving this job.

I received a fantastic offer earlier this week and of course I accepted. But I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear about submitting my notice. I meant to do it today but I chickened out, so tomorrow I plan on doing it first thing. I'm having a really hard time. I guess I'm afraid my boss is going to blow up at me and throw a tantrum and I really don't deal with confrontation well. I know it sounds childish, but anyone yelling makes my skin crawl even if it's not directed at me. I just panic. And I guess I'm afraid that's exactly what's going to happen tomorrow.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm absolutely freaking out.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm quitting an objectively terrible job that I've only held for 2 months because I got a better offer, and even though I know it's the right decision and I know I don't owe them anything, I'm really struggling with anxiety about telling my boss because he's been aggressive in the past.",Agitated_Article_791,9,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4ygmm/im_having_really_bad_anxiety_over_submitting_my/
Isolated myself because of anxiety,"Hello so I’m 21 years old (man) and I have isolated myself for nearly the whole year, i never had a problem with making friends and I have (had) a big friend group of amazing people, I was working everyday and so on , I’ve had anxiety for about 5 years now, but it was never stopping me from everyday life, I did party tho nearly every week with my mates, anyway out of nowhere I just stopped wanting to go out and see my friends, and I was the type of person that never wanted to be home! And always wanted to do stuff with my friends, and now it has been nearly 1 whole year since I have seen them, I feel bad, but when they tried to ring me I just didn’t answer.. and then made up an excuse later that I was busy even tho I’m just sitting in my room, so anyway I was still working and just came home after work and did my own thing, but then Covid 19 came and we didn’t have work for about 1 month, that was last year and I never went back, and I wasn’t really doing anything for awhile, so I was thinking oh well I’m bettering myself from not going out and partying and quitting cigarettes, so I continued not to go out and was home detoxing myself from all the shit I used to put into my body and I thought that would help my anxiety, it did, but then it started going worse again, and it got to the point that I was waking up feeling anxious which was scary! and then because I haven’t left the house in so long that now ever time I left my house (with my mum) I would get a massive anxiety attack, which made my not want to leave the house haha so  I don’t know why I’m writing all this but was just seeing if something similar has happened to someone, ( my family are my best friends now) I actually enjoy being around them more then I ever have, which isn’t a bad thing, but I know I’m just digging myself into a hole, I’ve gone from being a social person who hated being at home, to the complete opposite shutting all my friends out of my life and hardly leaving the house!

Overwhelming anxiety. Feel like I’m gonna explode or lash out. Help?,"Frequently throughout the day I have periods where I’m not intentionally focusing on anything. My motivation is fleeting so this may be a time where I was cleaning or organizing and lost motivation, deciding to sit down and take a break. Even if I’m just on my phone or laying in bed. 

During these periods I feel extremely restless/irritable/frustrated/overwhelmed. The thoughts overwhelmed me so much I have thoughts to lash out and hit myself or punch a wall or scream. I get so uncomfortable that I start to rub my hands up and down my thighs, pace or rock back and forth. I feel like I’m going to explode. I smoke cigarettes almost compulsively as well as smoke weed often. Just trying to feel SOMETHING. 

Something good, something sane, something satisfying and fulfilling. I’ve tried reading but find that I don’t have the attention span (I also have adhd). I’ve tried mediation but can’t quiet my mind enough. There’s plenty other coping skills I have tried, none of them successful. I take Ativan as a PRN which is helpful but I try to avoid it unless the anxiety is unbearable as Ativan is addictive and habit forming.

Random things trigger anxiety flashbacks,"Hi, I’ve been dealing with health anxiety after a hospital visit back in October, yes I’m ok it was high heart rate due to anxiety. Ever since then I get fluctuations of anxiety. I was wondering if other people experience this, random things like places, songs, food or certain videos trigger an anxiety feeling, sometimes I know why but sometimes I don’t. For the times I know why it’s usually because I was anxious at the moment. Like hearing a song while anxious can cause me to 1. not want to listen to that song ever again and 2. make me feel anxious when hearing it. Same can be for food, and places. I went on a walk and had a bad anxiety episode, now the place I want for a walk at makes me anxious and I don’t want to go there.

how to manage stressful situations?,"i'm 98% sure i have anxiety, going to the psychologist, for the first time in 22 years to finally confirm this in two days!! i always wanted to go but either the cost was too much or some people talked me out of it, saying that i just need to get over it. i recently got COVID and i have long-covid now. that made my anxiety much worse and i developed some sort of health anxiety (constantly worrying about my heart, checking my pulse 24/7 etc.)   


how do i manage stressful and anxiety driven situations so my HR &amp; BP don't skyrocket into oblivion? it scares me because i know it's not healthy to stress the heart so much and so heavily. i don't check it for my own good, but today, when i was at the cardiologist to take my blood, i'm sure it went up to 140, give or take. i try to do slow breathing techniques but none of them work. it's like when i'm there (especially at the doctors) there's nothing i can do. it's like my body &amp; mind go into a state of panic. i'm not sure how panic and/or anxiety attacks look exactly. but i turn completely white, i look like i ghost, my breathing is pretty shallow, my HR is through the roof, my voice gets shaky even when i try to hide it. the thing i'm most scared of is going to get a EGK tomorrow and my heart being all weird &amp; jumpy because of this anxiousness. i'm scared that the doctor won't get an accurate reading and might misdiagnose me or something, idk. blood pressure is pretty much perfect at home. my resting HR at home is usually 70-80, when i stand up it usually just goes up by 10bpm. but it goes crazy when i'm anxious, panicky etc.

Anxiety turning into anhedonia?,"Hey everyone,

I've mostly been active on the health anxiety sub, but things have changed a bit and I figured I'd post my question here.

A little over a month ago, I randomly woke up one morning and experienced some new cognitive difficulties. Among other things, I had this strange difficulty reading, which was one of the things that sent me into total panic. The specifics of the difficulty reading are described very well [here](https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/showthread.php?219246-Misreading-words-aware-of-myself-reading) (I did not write this, but this post pretty much nails the problem down precisely).

1 brain MRI, 3 ER visits, 2 primary care visits, numerous meetings with psychiatrists and 1 stay in the psych unit later, I can honestly say that most of the things I had feared have been ruled out completely. I'm still terrified of having schizophrenia (the only fear I couldn't disprove, even though the psychiatrists didn't think I had it), but at least I'm not hauling ass to the ER anymore. This whole thing feels a bit traumatic when I think about it, especially since it occurred so suddenly and I was alone, thousands of miles away from any of my friends or family. It cost me a lot of money, too. I'm just a grad student, I don't have a lot of money and I was trying to save so I could pay off my loans from undergrad, but the medical bills effectively ended that ambition.

The anxiety has died down a bit, but I now have a new problem: I literally cannot get off the couch. It's like, in the aftermath of all of this, I've just stopped being excited about all of the things I'm usually very enthusiastic to do. I often go through entire days where I do very little beyond taking a shower and brushing my teeth. I just can't bring myself to do anything, everything has started to feel like such a...task. I'm staying with friends right now and I have trouble sleeping, and when everyone goes to bed and I'm inevitably still awake, I cry because I just feel like I've lost my spark and I don't know if it's ever coming back. I feel like I'm almost in a pseudo-vegetative state, as if I'm only absorbing like 10% of the stimuli I encounter in any given day.

It's been a month of this now, though really more like 2 weeks because the other 2 weeks were spent with pretty intense anxiety still. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this (specifically the whole ""losing your spark after anxiety"" thing)? I'm not medicated at all, if that's relevant. I was prescribed lorazepam but I'm too scared to even take it (a very cruel bit of irony). It was given to me once in the ER, but I literally can't remember anything after taking it, so that didn't do much to cure my benzo phobia.

What can I do to stop myself from scratching or an Alternative for a better coping mechanism?,"Hi I've been noticing that I've been scratching the back of my head quite excessively whenever I get anxious or stressed and because of the scratching, it would sometimes cause infection and its been leaving some patches on my scalp too so I really need to stop.

How do I know if it's romantic love or platonic love (anxiety messing with my head)?,"Hey, so I'll try to summarize things without giving too many specific info but giving enough for you to be able to form an opinion.

I met a guy online a month ago, we started gaming, got closer (all while playing in a squad), our private messages became more flirty and cutesy making it obvious that we're both interested in each other without actually stating it, then some days ago he dropped the L-bomb (to which I honestly answered that I don't feel love yet but I do like him), and ever since then anxiety has taken over me. Waking up anxious, taking 1-2 hours to calm down, barely any appetite and overthinking during the day, then having to calm myself down before sleep too. It's gotten better, but especially when the anxious waves hit, I'm basically gaslighting and questioning my own feelings for him.

What I do know even in this messed-up state I'm writing in right now, is that I like him in the romantic sense, but I'm not sure it can/will be ever more than that. There are some things I'm ""missing"" from him which would make me more attracted to him (personality-wise) and would probably make me fall for him, but there are also things that he has which I like and didn't know I needed this much in a potential partner.

I'm just really torn because I know that I'm not gonna have a crush on just any person if they treat me well and give me love, but at the same time if I compare how I feel towards him and how I felt towards other people who I used to like romantically in the past, it's obvious that I'm missing the spark, the fire. I wouldn't want to lead him on and hurt him if I was sure this can't work between us, but at this point I'm honestly not sure if my mixed feelings are because of anxiety or because it really won't/can't work between us.

I don't think I could describe all my feelings towards him clearly, but here are some moments that can maybe help you guys have more insight:

* When I was anxious (but not all-in anxious) on the first bad day, I had the growing urge to just write him a kinda checking-in message, and I did, even though my anxiety wanted to push him away so much (I did this a few times, didn't wait for his answer but I wrote down how I was feeling and checked what he wrote later).
* When I'm not feeling any anxiety, I want to spend time with him, talk to him, goof around. Sometimes I flirt with him or write a cute message, sometimes he does. When he does it, it's basically 50-50 for me ever since the L-bomb: it either warms my heart and I smile, or it annoys me and starts/worsens my anxiety.
* There's a guy in our group who lately started to act kinda weirdly towards me in PMs, like other than the actually nice and caring messages about my wellbeing, he sometimes calls me hun, writes heart emojis, offers one-on-one playing sessions and things like that... So yeah, like I said, I feel weird about that - on the other hand, (when I'm not anxious) it flatters me and makes me happy when ""my"" guy writes these kinda things to me.
* Like I mentioned before, I miss that kinda excitement, the spark. However, (again, given that I'm not anxious) I feel safe, accepted, loved and cared for around him. He respects and understands when I say I need time/space, and I honestly believe him when he says it doesn't bother him when I'm acting all weird in this anxious state (he didn't call me weird, it's me saying that).
* I'd feel jealous and disappointed if he would flirt with another girl. And however much my anxiety in its lowest point tells me to just cut him out of my life, I can't do that. I wanna fight anxiety for him almost as much as for myself, and I'd feel devastated for both of us if it turned out that I have no chance of loving him romantically.
* Before the L-bomb I just enjoyed my time with him, tried to concentrate on and live in the present. I'm trying hard now too, but it's rare that I can keep a longer conversation with him without getting anxious at one point.

And for the end, I wanna add that this would be my first real relationship (I'm in my early 20s), so at least part of the anxiety is probably because of this. The second thing I wanna add is that I already have an appointment to a consultation with a psychologist, just really needed to write this out of myself now. I kindly ask you to not say anything rude if you feel like this is only platonic love or that it can't evolve into romantic love; I'd never want to hurt him on purpose, that's why I'm desperate enough to post this here. Would be awesome if people with the same core experience (aka not knowing exactly what do/did they feel towards someone) would share their story with me.

Edit: I finished writing this like an hour ago, since then I messaged him and we went into pretty deep topics. I basically told him that I'm not sure about my feelings but I want him to stay in my life, whether as a friend or something more, and he told me some personal things which made me even more scared of how much would it hurt him if I were to cut him off. I'm literally shaking with anxiety and can't think straight now.",anxiety___throw,6,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n50g7w/how_do_i_know_if_its_romantic_love_or_platonic/
(Possible trigger warning) Fear of torture,"

Hi i dont rly know how to use reddit but ive come here in hopes of finding help or advice. 

I have a history of anxiety and it’s very easy for me to start overthinking just about anything. I’ve been able, for the most part, to get over things i get stuck on. But im not sure if i can say the same for this time. 

I have a fear of being tortured. Theres not many posts i can find for advice. But the thoughts keep nagging me and i cant get loose from them. 

Just for additional context, i dont take therapy, and i dont follow any religions atm. 

Something thats helped me cope is the thought that torture never lasts forever. Theres always an end to it, no matter how bad it is. The victim will eventually die, or they will be released, or escape or something. Even if they live with PTSD and the awful psychological after effects of torture, they too, will die. Torture can’t last forever- your body will die eventually, even if it hurts. 

Another thing that helps is the fact that the victim may depersonalize. Im not very educated on this topic, and i dont want to make any incorrect assumptions about it, but my interpretation of it is that you somewhat leave your body, like you’re not really there. 

Am i crazy for trying to cope like that? Those two things have been what’s keeping me somewhat at peace, but then i think to myself “no, youre crazy. Torture is awful and you should be afraid of it. The pain ends but the pain exists.” 

I honestly dont know what to do at this point. I havent talked to anyone about it but im afraid to. 

Again, this is my first time posting here, so if ive made any mistakes in what i do please let me know, or if i should make any changes.

Can't stop feeling anxious because of the things my ex said..,"Trigger warning:  anxiety, negativity, and depression

My ex and I met online, never met up irl. I was a 17 year old highschool student and he was a 22 university student. I am still unsure whether it was morally right for him to date me. I'm 19 right now, and I don't even befriend 17 year olds and younger, let alone date them. 

Anyways, a year after our rough break up, we started being friends again. Throughout our short-lived friendship he'd make rude remarks or weird jokes that I didn't like. Anytime I'd point it out to him he would tell me I'm overreacting when all I said was that the remark was rude/weird. He would get very  defensive and dismiss my feelings, then I'd have to explain myself even more, explaining why the remark was rude and why I didn't  like it. He then would apologize. One time we decided to play minecraft together, he purchased a server and refused to let me pay half, although I insisted.  Later on I asked him to do something which required money, so I asked for his paypal email to send him money. He gave it to me and said ""Maybe pay for that minecraft server too while you're at it"". I paid for my half, but told him that he didn't have to phrase it this way if he wanted me to pay half, he started brushing it off as a joke, and I told him that it was a weird joke to make, he started saying that I was overeacting, after an in depth explanation as to why the joke made me uncomfortable, he apologized. At one point he started acussing me of leading him on because I failed to realize that he caught feelings for me, when he never said that he liked me more than a friend, and I thought that we were on the same page about not wanting to date each other. He agreed that he misinterpreted the things I said, and I apologized for failing to realize that he had a crush on me. 

A few days ago I had a mental breakdown because my inhertitance was stolen from me, and I couldn't afford college because of it. He knew about this, and a few days later started telling me how in a year he's going to inherit like 2 million pounds and that it's going to change his life drastically although he grew up in a wealthy family and basically has everything. I told him that I was really not the best person to share this with and that it was inconsiderate. He apologized, but after this incident I decided to end the friendship, especially after finding out that he had feelings for me. A day later he emails me, telling me how I am toxic, negative, and ungrateful. Dedicating a whole paragraph to all the things he did for me, including giving me $150 to fix my computer, at the time he said that I don't have to return that money to him, and now, a year later he asked me for it. I gave it back, and thanked him for it. He knew a lot about me, and he was there during my lowest low, and now he was holding it all over my head in that email. Saying how I had way too many irrational outburts, that I was dramatic, and negative, all with examples. Taking back all of his apologies for the weird jokes and rude remarks. 

 It's been almost a month since I got that email, and I can't stop feeling like other people precieve me as negative, irrational, or toxic. The other day a friend asked me if I liked a certain dessert, and after saying no, I felt toxic and negative. The other day I had cravings, and I felt greedy for eating a whole bar of chocolate. These are the things I feel almost every day, and it's exhausting :c I tried to reach out to him for closure because his words really hurt me, and he told me to stop gaslighting him o\_o He's a psychiatry student, and I feel like he knows what he's doing, but I still can't help myself but feel terrible.

Talking in front of people,"I've had a bad phobia of speaking in front of people and it's made it hard to do a few school projects (giving speeches and presentations).

I haven't been able to talk in front of people, not one time. While my anxiety has gotten better, this fear has not. I had a panic attack in front of my class once becuase my english teacher tried forcing me to do it. He ended up letting me do an alternative because I physically couldn't do it.
At my old school I literally ran out of a class because I couldn't surpress my fight or flight instinct anymore and so I just ran.

Today me and a group had to give a presentation and I was a wreck all morning. My hands were constantly shaking and I was trying to surpress my panick attack during 1st period, but I had a meeting with my teacher and just broke. My teacher tried his best to comfort me, but I was still shaky and trying to hold back another panic attack.
During 3rd (when we had to give the presentation) I had the worst panic attacks ever while I was practically begging my teacher to not have me stand up there. The mere thought of it almost sends me into a panic attack, so being in a group of people that I didn't like and having to talk in front of so many people that I didn't know and/or like was worse.

I felt so pathetic as I was sitting there, crying and shaking, begging this teacher not to have me do it. He acted like I was faking it or something, but eventually gave up and let me not do it. He wasn't sure whether to give me an F or what, since he didn't have any other work planned since he wasn't expecting anyone to sit it out.

I was so worn out, mentally exhuasted, and tired the rest of the day becuase I had to fight through several panic attacks and twice as many anxiety attacks. I am still having an anxiety attack because it's really hard for me to heal from stuff like that.

I know this is long and I'm sorry, but I just wish I was able to get over this fear, and I wish people (especially teachers) understood how severe and terrrifying anything like this can be. Even minor panic attacks can be so terrifying.",Ryno_Ars_Cinnz_,3,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n536x2/talking_in_front_of_people/

How to deal with anxiety in a relationship,"So I’ve been dating this guy for a little over a year things were going great until my anxiety started to go down hill. It had already been going downhill but I never realized how bad it was until my anxiety my him cry. Personally, I’ve suffered with what I think is anxiety since I was 11, I’m almost 20 I’m, and I used to find ways of help it and in a way it seemed controlled it but now I can’t handle it anymore. Because of the fact I could no longer control my anxiety and for the fact it was getting worse, I decided to tell my doctor about it and he prescribed me some meds to try. They worked for a bit but in the end they messed with my mind in a way that I couldn’t take the medication daily as I needed. So I tried something else and in the end the symptoms of those medications were too much for me to handle. I tell you guys all of this to just explain where I am right now. I’ve been off of those medications for a few weeks now and my anxiety has been coming out so much and in different ways. It always seems to affect those who are closest to me like my family relationship and the relationship with my partner. It’s come to the point where my bf has become a source of anxiety because of some situations we’ve been dealing with when it comes to his parents. So now it’s hard to talk to him without getting anxious, panicked, or irritated (My anxiety makes me easily pissed off and makes me panic easy so that’s why I’m getting irritated). A hard thing in our relationship is the fact that my bf doesn’t have any mental illness at all. He’s the most healthy human being mentally I know. But with that comes a lack of understanding in how to support me and how to help me cope. He gets so emotional about my anxiety that anytime I try to tell him I’m in a anxious mindset he ends up becoming so emotional drained that he can’t take care of me and I feel as though I have to take care of him. I don’t know how to help my relationship with him and how I can help him understand how to help me. I need some help or advice.

And so now I’m questioning myself like “gosh maybe I’m just being silly I don’t need meds look how fine I feel”. Even though just earlier today I was anxious as heck.

Get really bad anxiety when cutting my toenails. Help?,"So for years I simply wasn't strong enough to cut my own toenails. My mom used to do them for me, and she'd make comments about how anxious I got and made jokes about accidentally cutting my toes off or cutting into my skin if I didn't stop squirming. 

My grandma has cut them before and asked me why I got so nervous when she was doing them and I couldn't explain why. I would just start shaking and sweating badly.

It doesn't help that now that I'm strong enough to even cut my nails, instead of getting congratulated for it after never being able to do so on my own, my grandma berated me a few weeks ago about how my nails were long. I told her that I had cut them myself a week or so before and she didn't bat an eye. I had to loudly say ""no"" to her sitting in front of me, about to grab the clippers and cut my nails even though I told her I didn't want her to. That's when I told her I had cut them myself, and she said to cut my nails in front of her then so she could see it. I said no again and she sighed and rolled her eyes like a whiny little bitch and got up and left. I'm an adult, I'll cut my nails when I feel like I need to.

Well I needed to tonight because one of my nails started digging into the skin a little. I noticed as I was cutting them I was shaking a little and sweating like mad, and it was making it hard to grip the clippers which just made me more nervous since I'm so inexperienced using them and am terrified of accidentally pinching/cutting myself.

Is there anything I can really do to remedy this? Is it just cutting my toenails on my own until my brain finally realizes that I'm not putting myself in danger by doing so?",Pixel-Robot-Studios,0,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n57w94/get_really_bad_anxiety_when_cutting_my_toenails/
Feeling like throat is fat/ have a double chin,"I’m assuming this is from anxiety, it’s happened a few times and I can never tell which comes first; the anxiety or the neck thing.

Sleep Anxiety | Feeling Like I Can't Handle It Anymore,"Hello. It's 2 am here. I've pretty much given up for tonight given the fact my heart is practically bursting through my chest and my head has been rolling a film about the harmfulness of bad sleep on loop for the whole evening and night so far.

Fortunately, this crap happens to me in cycles, since for the last few months I slept just fine. However, as soon as I even so much as think about losing control again, it's usually too late as I crash down the rabbit hole almost instantly.

Right now though, I'm probably going through the roughest time I ever have, and have serious trouble coping and staying hopeful.

You see, for the last year and a half or so I haven't had a proper schedule due to school being handled online. This did wonders to my sleep since I had some nice leeway to survive even if I didn't catch shuteye immediately. That's not the case anymore.

My anxiety is causing me to not want to play games with people I used to enjoy playing with...,"Sounds dumb right?

Once upon a time I was with someone who treated me like dirt. When they would start being rude to me, I felt like I couldn't function. I'd accidently mess up doing stuff I'd otherwise be fine doing. Cooking, speaking, typing, you name it - if I was in the process of doing it and they started in I'd start doing a bad job.

Some people even started hiding online from various people in the group so they wouldn't have to worry about them wanting to play with them.

Last night I hopped online with 2 of my friends that I play games with pretty consistently. We do our typical banter together and I know in my heart they don't mean anything they say. We all poke fun with each other. The issue was, they were playing with 2 other people who I used to really enjoy playing with. Now those 2 people...I really don't think they mean to make me feel the way I do and I don't want to be the sensitive little girl in the group. But last night was just rough for me...One wouldn't stop making me feel like I was terrible at the game, which made me play even worse. In the end I just shut up and played. I didn't really talk much until I got off. 

And I've been bothered ever since. 

I thought about messaging one of the 2 that I still play with and have a good time most of the time. The other can just be an asshole.

Advice,"Hello all, 

Hope everyone is fighting strong and improving as days pass, don’t let anxiety run your thoughts, you will get through this!!! 

I am really looking for some reassurance as my anxiety has been killing me over the past two weeks surrounding this issue. 

All the tests I have done are RT-PCR tests. I am a 19M.

I was exposed to covid on April 21st from my massage therapist. I found out on the 24th and I went to get tested immediately even tho I know it was to quick. The result game back negative the next day, I was relieved for a second but my anxiety knew this was just the beginning. I waited till the ideal time to go get tested which I was told between them, I went again to get tested on the 29th of April, got the test back next day and it was negative. My anxiety still did not settle and continue to persist, all of her other clients she saw that day, 4 total, have all been retested and have tested negative as well. Throughout this entire time since I found out I was exposed my anxiety has been through the roof, I check my temperature at least 40 times a day. I have been constantly fatigued and feel drained over stressing my body over this, I have been so eagled eye over every sensation my body feels and it’s terrible. I didn’t feel satisfied with two negative PCR tests, so I put myself at risk again and went to get tested on May 2nd, 11 days since my exposure, I received the test again next day and I tested negative once again, I woke up the next morning feeling somewhat relieved but still very anxious that I could still have the virus, as the day passed I keep going on this thread and scaring myself even more and I started to feel dizzy and lightheaded as the day went on, I had a very dry irritated sinus like in between my throat and my nose as it was raining a lot my anxiety was like your having a sore throat it’s the first sign, but it has not been feeling like that at all today. I have not been drinking nearly enough water and I have recognized that. Today I was shaking in bed thinking I have covid, I felt the same way fatigued and just drained by putting my body through hell stressing over this. I was a very heavy weed smoker but as I was exposed I went cold turkey completely. I coughed up black and yellow tinted phlegm which made my anxiety completely spiral. Today I have been feeling generally fine, but I have had pins and needles in my hands which have worried me, I cracked my lower back for the first time in a while today and it didn’t hurt at first but now my lower back is in a lot of pain and I’m worried that this could be the start of covid body aches even tho, it’s my two weeks since I’ve been exposed tomorrow, my lower legs have felt aches today but they last very brief for 10-30 seconds, and I’ve had ice pick headaches again very brief throughout the day, but I just have this overall feeling of dizziness and I just feel like I don’t wanna do anything and I simply can’t. 

I live at home with my parents and I’m so afraid to give them the virus as they are older and at risk. I have been doing my best to distance and wear a mask throughout the two weeks but I have slipped up at times. 

The reason why I’m posting this is as I am unsure what I should do, tomorrow is officially 14 days since my exposure and have had 3 negative results to show for it. I want to get one more test done to just ease my mind one final time, but I am so worried about putting myself more at risk to go get tested again. How rare would it be to have 3 negative tests that spread out, I am beyond worried I could still have it and not know and potentially kill my parents or I could die from the virus myself. 

Can someone please offer me some peace of mind as I am unsure if this is anxiety or I could be at the start of my symptom onset, I am having a panic attack at the moment!!

Anxiety - loss of purpose/future,"I suffer from anxiety and it has peaked over the last couple of years. I have seen a therapist before and she said anxiety is often fuelled by a sense of underachievement and I feel like that really hits home.

I find myself getting annoyed at the simplest things in life, feeling a sense of unfairness in things that would not bother many others.
I also constantly find myself thinking about what I wish I’d done in my past, and rarely look to the future and think about what I can achieve. It therefore gives me a sense that all the days/weeks/months fly by without anything to show.

Spiraling into marfans madness,"I'm spiraling out of control. My boyfriend has like a handful of Marfans syndrome symptoms (long face, tall, crowded teeth, stretch marks on his back) and I feel like I'm dying and having a full on mental break down. I posted about it in an FB marfans group and they're all like, ""oh yeah I could see that, his face looks sort of Marfans."" Or, ""horizontal stretch marks definitely equal marfans."" 

Now I can't stop, I can't get anything done. He's getting checked and thinks this is silly, I have tons of people with just as many or more symptoms in my life that don't have marfans and are just tall, but I am SURE HE HAS IT. I'm scouring marfans groups, everyone that has a somewhat similar face is making me certain. He lifts tires at his work and I'm certain it'll soon rupture his aorta and he will die before he gets checked and I will never recover from his death and live with infinite guilt that I didn't get him to a doctor sooner. I seriously can't breathe, I mean I know I'm breathing but I can't really feel the air in my lungs. 

Marfans is consuming my life and every sign he doesn't have it is meaningless and every story of some undiagnosed person dropping dead is killing me. I thought maybe asking a marfans fb would help but now all I can do is cry and lay here. I feel like my hypochondria will kill me before he even gets to a checkup.

I don't even know why I'm posting. It feels like I won't make it, like somehow my heart is going to rupture too. I'm starting to feel like I have marfans too . . .",webwonder23,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n54bbz/spiraling_into_marfans_madness/
How can I decrease my anxiety when reading?,"Hello everyone!

I’ve been struggling with focusing, specifically when reading for a while. When I have to read something, I start feeling anxious, especially if it is something important. I feel like I have a very difficult time focusing, and I don’t understand what I read. Sometimes, I have to read out loud to understand what I am reading. Since I also have OCD, I feel anxious when reading things that I write or type, because I don’t want to make any mistakes.

What are some ways that I can lower my anxiety and improve my focus when reading? I really want to improve my reading comprehension, and this focusing issue is making everything much more difficult.

"Fuck health anxiety, and anxiety in general","It's so hard to control your thoughts and no one except people who have anxiety understands this. Even when I'm starting to feel ok, I have to get a thought that ruins all my progress. It's so tiring. My current obsession is the swollen lymph nodes I got from the Covid vaccine and I haven't been able to calm down at all since discovering them. Every second of the day I'm plagued by thoughts that it's actually from some horrible disease. I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want them to give me a death sentence. It's so tiring, I just want to have a normal mind. My boyfriend and I are long-distance and if I wake up and he hasn't texted me I immediately think he's dead or something and start crying. There have been so many instances where I'm scared of falling asleep because I'm scared I'll die in my sleep. I wasn't always like this and I think a big factor has been being stuck at home because of Covid. I'm an introvert and like being at home, but it's definitely made my mental health deteriorate because I have too much free time to worry about things. I remember 4 years ago I had excruciating stomach pain that would wake me up from sleep and I begged my mom to take me to the hospital. I wasn't even anxious or nervous when I was awaiting what the doctor would tell me. If that happened now, I'd be scared out of my mind thinking it's stomach cancer or something and I have weeks to live. This fear of cancer was also triggered by the fact that my best friend's mom passed away recently from lung cancer. I keep reading reddit posts about how people got diagnosed with cancer and keep obsessively searching to see if their symptoms apply to me. I also have OCD that targets my relationship (ROCD). It feels like I just can't catch a break.",asjd12345,232,105,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n45w8o/fuck_health_anxiety_and_anxiety_in_general/
Question relating to possible PTS or screwed up from anti-depressants?,"I'm going to make this short as possible, summer of 2019 I went from weaned from effexor to Wellbutrin because I thought wellbutrin could give me more energy and have less side effects. It actually made me more tired, so I went back to effexor without even weaning off of wellbutrin. This triggered terrible panic attacks and brain fog for a good week or two. (worst weeks of my life). I also will throw in there I had a pretty traumatic experience with ""dabbing"" as in I had a panic attack I wasn't able to bring myself out of for like a full day. I have had anxiety problems as a young girl but these next fews years until now I havnt seen to get rid of panic attacs, i'm having them more than I ever have in my life. I also tried Neurofeedback and I think that honestly made me worse.

Got harrassed while walking home alone at night. How can I get over it?,"Some slight trigger warning about getting harrassed/followed/scary situation.

The other night I was walking home on my usual route from work. I got off my usual stop. I don't wear flashy clothes, I walk fast and I mind my own business. I was the only one who left the train and another guy also got off. He opened the door for me. I just said thanks. I didn't really think about it so much so I just started walking to my usual route but for some reason I had an odd feeling about this guy; he was of mid-age, strange looking, and plus he was taking the same path as me. Nobody else was outside. I dismissed those thoughts, thinking I was just being judgmental, paranoid and watched too many horror films.

The path to my home is dark, not much streetlights and forests surrounding majority of the area. Nobody was outside that night and there weren't any cars passing by. He eventually picked up his walking pace and passed me. I felt extremely relieved, mentally beating myself up for being so paranoid over nothing.

Suddenly he turned around and stopped walking. He just... stood there. It seemed like... he was waiting for something? I walked faster, then he shouted something I didn't understand. I was REALLY confused. He suddenly grabbed my arm and started talking about satan and wanting to kill me or whatever? It was really hard to understand since his speech was incoherent. He was possibly drunk/high off amphetamines or whatever. I slapped his hand away from his grip and semi-jogged, eventually ran, and then he started running after me too. I was like, fuck, I AM in a horror movie. He also had a backpack on and he was carrying either a knife or a broken bottle. It was really hard to tell because it was pitch black outside and I didn't really look at him so much because I was frightened.

I didn't think about calling 112 while running because I was thinking he would just grab my phone and throw it away, making it useless. I was so terrified to the point where the only logical thing to do was to run.

Luckily a restaurant nearby was open and I went inside and he followed me in. For some reason, I tried to downplay it and acted casual so I wouldn't freak the cashier out and attempted to order something, at this point I was already shitting my pants. I really don't know why I pretended to act normal. I guess I froze up and I wanted to see if the situation would further escalate if there are witnesses and I was right: he wouldn't stop touching my arm/shoulder and he was basically hovering over my back. The cashier looked confused and I finally told the cashier to call the police. The guy suddenly got scared and threatened us because he didn't want the police to come. I guess he panicked, went outside, stared at us with the MEANEST look ever and eventually left.

It's only been a day but I'm extremely shaken up by what happened. I had so much anxiety when I was walking home today to the point where I felt like throwing up. How can I walk alone at night without being so damn anxious? I would greatly appreciate any advice. Oh, and I can't buy pepper spray here, you need to have a license for it (eg. police officers). Any alternatives for that would be great too.",Pinkypiesho,2,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4zb4u/got_harrassed_while_walking_home_alone_at_night/
Can always worrying about your relationship failing be a sign of anxiety/depression? What should i do? Long post sorry but please read,"So i am 25f and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 10 years! We have had our good times and bad times, but we’ve always stuck it out and came out stronger together. I must admit that about 2 times in the past, we almost broke up and it absolutely destroyed me. I would feel like he was pulling away from me and he would deny it and say we were good, but then it would just build up and he would finally admit something was wrong and we would be at a really low point and on the verge of a breakup. Although we never actually broke up, these times absolutely destroyed me and i don’t know how i got through them. For both times this happened, we put in the hard work to get back on track and eventually things got patched up, and actually they became better than ever before and we would be so happy we stayed.

Now let’s go to the present. I can’t seem to shake the anxiety that something is wrong or that he will break up with me. I have always been like this since the first time we almost split, but lately it has been unbearable and all consuming. For some background, i recently went through a health scare and although i am fine now, it took a much larger toll on me than i would like to admit. I also was put on medication to manage my thyroid levels, and i definitely feel like that has to have a huge impact on my rise in anxiety lately. 

Back to the main saga! I can’t stop worrying if we are good or not. I have brought it up and he says we are good, but i feel like i worry since in the past he would say we were good and then it would turn out we weren’t. I just want to keep talking about it over and over and over and get all the reassurance i can. He hates these kinds of conversations, and most of the time i just get a short response like “yes we are absolutely good, thank you for checking up but you don’t have to worry” and my anxious mind translates this into “short reply? Must be bad!” since i’m over here writing paragraphs about my feelings.

I over analyze everything. We went to dinner the other day and the car ride was kinda quiet, so my mind is already thinking “he has nothing to say to you, he isn’t interested anymore, you’re boring to him after 10 years” etc. It’s like i make myself miserable over literally anything, and then i feel more anxiety/pressure to try to make myself seem bubbly and fun and full of conversation in hopes of looking more interesting. We were intimate the other night and i was feeling kind of fat, so i went into that with 0 confidence and could not shake the thought of how bad i looked and he probably isn’t as attracted to me. Not to be TMI, but i would be uh, touching him, and i was literally thinking “he’s going to get soft any second because he doesn’t like you anymore.” Like it’s getting so out of hand.

It’s also at a point where i’m so worried about the future. We are supposed to buy a place together in the summer and all i keep thinking is that he doesn’t really want to and any day now he’ll tell me. Or that maybe he will but it’s just because he feels bad for me. And then i also come up with all these backup plans in my head if he does leave me, like how i would just completely move away to another state if we broke up, etc, to feel like i have something going for me i guess or to get away from it all as a distraction. I play scenarios in my head of him breaking up with me to almost prepare myself for how it will feel too. I’m driving myself crazy.

I don’t know what to do here. It’s really out of hand and i don’t know what to do. I try to talk to him about it, but he assures me nothing is wrong, and my anxious brain just over thinks what he says anyway. I know it has to get annoying constantly being asked if things are good, so i am trying not to spam him 24/7 with questioning. I try to be positive and tell myself that this man makes time for me and does things to make me laugh, etc and that it is all in my head, but i can’t stop. How do i stop? Why am i doing this to myself? Has anyone ever dealt with this? I would take any advice :( i know therapy will be suggested, but i really don’t know if i have the time at the moment as awful as that sounds. I am highly considering it, but if anyone has advice for the meantime i would greatly appreciate it.",confusedanon7689,1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n53xdj/can_always_worrying_about_your_relationship/

Can’t handle anxiety with life events anymore,"I find myself crippled with anxiety. I have had anxiety my entire life and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia and panic disorder. I function well on a daily basis because I’ve been working from home for several years. That has helped tremendously.

I do not take any medication daily, but take a benzo if anxiety is bothering me. I am dealing with the stress of buying a house which has left me crippled with anxiety and also I have anxiety coming from my brother and his wife since his wife (more the wife talking through him) and her family are extremely demanding and they’re having a child and are claiming we “don’t seem that excited” which is absurd. So I’ve got these two things going on at the same time along with their baby shower coming up which my mom is making me feel like I should go because it will hurt his feelings if I don’t. It coincides with our closing date so I think I can get out of going and dealing with nasty relatives on top of his wife and her family’s overbearing and controlling nature. 

Then there’s the house stuff- we haven’t told our families yet and my family and his family is fine. Just his dad and step mom are a bit much. I just am so anxious about all the house stuff, and the sellers still haven’t gotten something needed yet. 

I have taken my prescription (clonazipam- I think it’s only .25mg so very small, otherwise I get tired but I can take .5mg as well) and it almost always works for anxiety moments but it’s not helping me at all with the above. I find myself unable to function sometimes but I’m powering through. I just shut down when it’s too much and I really have to be on top of the house stuff and have been. I am very close to shutting down though because with a house so many things absolutely must be done by a certain date, and I’m ready but we also have to worry about the sellers being on top of things. 

Thank you for listening. Have you ever not gone to a big family event like a baby shower? I even have anxiety about dealing with not going if any feelings are hurt. I don’t even know that I will have time. And there’s also toxic family on my own side of the family and my brothers wife’s. I just cannot deal with more than one thing at a time and I cannot stand it when people require you act perfect. I still can’t believe we “don’t seem excited”. I have dreaded that shower since before the house came up. Then I am dreading how things will be when the baby arrives.

Admitting it is the first step,"I've had panic attacks for about 15 years. I've tried a variety of medications and therapy. When I talked about my anxiety I would always say **""I'm not really an anxious person, these attacks just come out of nowhere.""** 

Recently I started reading a workbook recommended on this sub called ""Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic"" -- I started it, because my panic attacks have gotten much worse since COVID and my agoraphobia has worsened (I fear leaving the house and being in loud/noisy/trapped places, primarily driving and going to malls or stores). 

In reading this book I've realized that anxiety and panic are different (big duh I guess) and that while the panic attacks cause me the most pain, I definitely **do** have anxiety, and they are linked. 

Things I didn't realize meant I was anxious: always getting places an hour early, drowning myself in work and loving how I feel when I'm busy, creating to-do lists all the time, constantly thinking about a million things at once, worrying about things that may never happen constantly, worrying incessantly about how people perceive me, a persistent lingering thought about dying. A lot of these traits helped me be good at life. I'm known to be a good friend (I always remember to send birthday cards) and I'm punctual and hyper-organized (so I thrive at work).

But those obsessive thoughts about being early, preparing for every eventuality, always detailing every detail of a trip, google mapping everywhere (even places I know well)... it made me realize that my body holds this TENSION. I am ALWAYS tense. I realized it's not necessarily ""normal"" to always be TENSE. And the tension I feel and the anxiety about the future was generating the perfect conditions for me to experience panic. 

I'm about 1/3 of the way through this workbook but today I drove my car and went into two stores. I used to do these things pre-COVID with no issue (for the most part). Some parts of my anxiety are already a part of my personality (I still think showing up gently early to places is polite) but I'm going to try and teach myself to just let go a little bit. I'm hoping that accepting that I do have anxious tendances will allow me to control the panic attacks and leave the house/live like a normal person again.",overkillcentral,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n51jrn/admitting_it_is_the_first_step/

He also said that sometimes when someone has something traumatic happen in childhood, the amygdala becomes 'broken' as such and that's why in adulthood it's all over the place, suddenly basically making you feel like the world is ending while you're just sitting chilling having a nice time. It helped me to learn exactly what was causing as it showed me the fear was not based on anything real, my brain was just getting mixed up. I tell you this in case it helps any of you too and please share what's helped you :)",helpneeded42,655,117,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3txdp/what_is_one_of_the_most_helpful_things_your/

Imposter Syndrome and Covid,"To give you a short background, I have had Imposter Syndrome since I can remember. I have 3 degrees, came top of my class in college and have a good paying stable job in finance. But I've always felt that I just got lucky somehow. I don't deserve my degrees. I don't deserve it when people appreciate me. They have no clue about the anxiety I face everyday. I'm unfit to do my job, I don't know why they would hire someone so unstable. I don't have confidence, I always doubt the work I'm doing. I feel like I'm always doing something wrong. 
Anyway, I tested positive for Covid a week ago and fortunately have been riddled with only mild symptoms and took the week off work. When my test results came out positive, Imposter Syndrome played here too! I'm not sick enough to have Covid, it's a false result. I'm not sick enough to get a week off work, I don't even deserve the week off. Everyone's going to find out I'm faking Covid and then they're going to hate me because they had to take up additional work during the week.
I know it's all in my head but how do I make it stop! I must be so messed up if I've convinced myself that I'm faking Covid!",Leavemealone1_1,3,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4qdtt/imposter_syndrome_and_covid/
Dear r/offmychest user who bullied the hell out of me despite what you read in my post:,"In March 2020, I wrote a post about how I confessed to tone policing others on Twitter during the start of the 2020 anxiety. I did this by talking about how 2020 wasn't all that bad and how things are going well for me. I was rude, selfish, and I vented in an inappropriate way to these people of which there is no excuse. The point of my post was that this wasn't the person who I wanted to be and made a vow to change my behavior once another Twitter user called me out on my actions which were uncalled for.

I was feeling terrible guilt for my actions at the time of me writing that post. And what did you do? You trashed me for my actions, painted me as a psychopath who had no remorse for what I did, and told me to ""keep punching down. It's a real good look.""

I replied to you in the best manner I could. Telling you that you missed the part where I said I felt bad about my actions and skimmed over the part where I apologized for my actions. I told you that I was so sorry for hurting you. This was not the person I wanted to be and I made that point clear in my post.

You responded by saying you read those parts (if you did, you would not have said the things you just said) and took certain paragraphs from my post out of context or were written while I was in the heat of the moment. I made a point in my first comment to you that I made a vow to stop doing this inexcusable behavior. And what did you say? You claimed that I was expecting praise for something I ""never said"".

 I politely said to you that you were breaking rule #1 which is that we don't ever insult, invalidate, or antagonize the OP. In your next comment, you continue to break rule #1 even after I called you out and reported you for it. This is ironic considering that you frequently did the same to other Reddit users even though you aren't even a moderator. In response, you called me out for another rule I didn't even break. You accused me of sh\_tposting on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/). I WROTE THAT POST IN COMPLETE SHAME AND GUILT FOR MY ACTIONS AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF SHTPOSTING! By that logic, everything on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/) is a sh\_tpost! 

I replied to a different user on the same post who was actually really kind and understanding. I wrote to them about all the good things that happened to me in 2020. I noticed you greatly toned down your hostility and appeared conversational. I wanted to keep that up so I made a friendly comment to you but you wrote back ""You're free to leave whenever you want."" No! You leave! I'm the OP after all! Okay, I didn't say that last part, but I made some cute little comment about leaving that I cringe looking back on.

Looking back, I was too nice to you. I should have been more direct and dominant. I reported you for every comment on my post yet you didn't get banned. I wrote about this a year ago on this sub. But because I mentioned the specific post and revealed your username, I got permabanned on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/) when it should have been you.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I would appreciate some advice on how to get over this because it gave me psychological damage when it happened.",Some1inreallife,3,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4slcm/dear_roffmychest_user_who_bullied_the_hell_out_of/

I think I have PTSD,So I have been taking advantage of while in a hospital for anxiety and depression when I was 13. The only person I really talked to was an 18 year old man who was constantly talking to me and getting a little to close to me. I noticed that the other girls were talking about me which also affected me. Then my  sophomore year of high school I was pressured into dating someone. The next day we saw each other we had class together and he sat behind me. He then proceeded to put his foot on my butt for the entirety of class later that day I told him I did not want to date him. So whenever a guy gets near me I’m in that set of mind that they will do something. The about a month ago a friend messaged me saying he liked me that night we went to watch a movie together we “cuddle” for not that long. But then he was constantly texting me and if I didn’t respond right away he would think something is wrong. Then the 3rd night he said I love you. The next morning I ended it because I couldn’t handle it.  I was having panic attacks and now night terrors that feel extremely real. Being SA and being attacked. I get random panic attacks thinking some guy is coming up to me or following me. I get this other feeling but I’m not sure how to describe it like I’m back in the night terror.,Jessiea511,3,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4puny/i_think_i_have_ptsd/

New to the sub - asking for some help,"I've got a LOT on my plate these days. Check my post history if you want all the details, but my main issue I'm dealing with is this fear of being alone. 

I wake up earlier than I'd like with the anxiety, I start to journal and cry - I usually post on some support sites on reddit (a bit compulsively). I'll cry and do this as long as I can - without a deadline it'll last about 2 hours and I'll feel pretty exhausted, my body will hurt from being so tense. 

It's kind of the only thing that makes the fear seem manageable - posting on reddit and getting feedback. I'm used to having one or two close friends really help me manage my feelings but turns out that's not healthy and not respectful of boundaries so I've lost that outlet. In one way it's awful because I feel like I'm drowning but in another, I know this is something I need to work on.

I find it so difficult to sit and meditate when I feel this way. I have to limit going on walks because I have some minor mobility issues that I need to do light exercises for - REALLY difficult to do the exercises when I'm feeling panicked. I just...panic. I worry. 

Does this reddit posting seem problematic or is it an okay coping mechanism? How can I get to a point where I can exercise and meditate from the place of panic? I really wish I had someone with me to help me stay on track and I'm learning that I must be that person for myself but I'm struggling so hard.",Affectionate_Ad1208,2,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4tp13/new_to_the_sub_asking_for_some_help/
One more hour (grief + ED triggers),"I have an impromptu session with my therapist in one hour. It's after noon and I haven't had breakfast. I cried and journaled, I met with a potential new roommate (my old one/bestie is leaving), did some errands for work, found my way back home because I wanted to cry more. Now I'm back to journaling via reddit.

This day. I have a day to fill. It's not even empty but I'm not excited about my plans. What I want is to be around the two people in my life who support me emotionally. One is my roomie, but she's needing space and that's why she's moving out. The other is my sister but she's needing space today. I have a lot of painful things in my life right now - grief over my dad's death, grief over my dog's death, facing the burden of childhood stuff, now grief over my roommate leaving, uncertainty in who I'll live with (terrified to live alone). 

So I'm not going to be supported emotionally by my friends today and that's probably something I need to avoid doing because it's part of why I'm such a wreck today. Being alone didn't used to be like this until I outsourced my emotional regulation. I have my therapist who'll help but the session will go by so quickly and I just...I'm so scared. 

I clearly neglect myself when I'm under stress - I push off eating, I push off maintaining my body, I don't think I've had a sip of water all day. The reason? I just keep thinking ""I'll sort through this feeling first and then..."" It's hard to eat through the panic. 

When I'm around people I can do these things better - which is part of why I don't want to live alone. I don't know how to cope with these feelings. I wake up and in my mind I'm begging my roommate not to leave but she's leaving. Honestly the thought of getting up and going to the kitchen to make some food and eating it alone is so sad to me. Even being in this house is so depressing. These feelings are so big. 

I'll be perfectly honest - I don't think I'm cut out for this. 

In my mind I'm just screaming ""God, please help me"" and I'm not even religious. I'm just so overwhelmed by this loneliness and this fear, I don't feel like I can survive it. Please help me. Please, please help me. I know I have to be strong to survive this, I know it has to come from me. 

Nobody is coming to help me....what can I do? What can I do to survive this? I can't depend on the people I used to depend on and I feel like I'm falling off a cliff. I felt this way before when my dog died but I had people then. NOW - WHAT DO I HAVE.",Affectionate_Ad1208,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4xzuw/one_more_hour_grief_ed_triggers/
Advise and help needed,"Hey guys,
I’m kinda new to this. I found out about two months ago that I have a version of PTSD (trauma disorder) and a worry disorder/anxiety disorder. It’s been a hard road for me. And my boyfriend also struggles with this and I can notice that. Sometimes when he’s mad at me it feel like i literally can’t breathe and I get so upset about it. It sometimes even gives me panic attacks when someone is mad at me. I think this is caused by my parents. Do some of you sometimes also feel this way? I just get really sad and start crying and like I just can’t think straight and can’t breathe and I act out on other people because I need someone to calm me down. And when that someone isn’t there I just can’t cope. I also get a bit mad at my boyfriend for ignoring me when I say I feel sad and that sometimes (like today) results in a fight.

Small Vent,"I'm just sad. Suicidal ideation is very real some days. 

My medications have been a pain in the ass, almost always worsening my mental state even after 2 years and many medications. 

I'm wasting my life away at a desk job in the prime of my life and it hurts. I don't even like my job. But I need the income and I wouldn't even know what kind of other job to seek out. I like the company I work for and the people are wonderful. Not many jobs are like that, I realize. But 8 hours a day at a desk is torture to me. It is the EXACT situation I feared getting into since college. And here I am...I've fallen right into the very nightmare I used to fear. And I have no way out. Anxiety makes it impossible on top of everything else. 

I'm watching friends and family proceed with lives. Having children and families, going to school for their passions, succeeding in other areas while I sit and watch it all go by from a cubicle...

I've never wanted children, but watching my dear friends go through the process and finding their purpose in being parents and pleasing their own parents with giving them grand children and following a normal life path makes me feel so inadequate and like such a disappointment to my own family. 

Or on the contrary, my friends want to commit suicide and there is nothing I can ever say or do to help them and it makes me feel like a failure, and terrified for them.

I did go to college for a degree I liked, but there's nothing I can really do with it and beyond that I don't want a master's degree so I can't really further myself in that area. I also have no passions to pursue. 

I have to watch friends go through some other things, LGBT things, finding pride in themselves and loving themselves while I cannot work through my own LGBT issues. It hurts a lot to watch them find happiness with themselves when I can't. It's another reminder that I am just a fuck up in life and going nowhere. 

My therapist just went on indefinite leave and I no longer have therapy, but after 2 years, I don't think it was helping me anyway. I've read the self-help books and tried to address my issues but I just can't. 

My life is a waste and I have no purpose in this world. I don't look forward to anything. Every day is a trudging journey to a grave, maybe even an early one. 

My home is a mess with dishes piled up endlessly in my sink, I'm a disgrace and a piss poor role model for my sibling, I only shower maybe once a week, I don't fold or hang laundry and it's piled up and strewn everywhere in my home. I have boxes just laying around everywhere. I have no motivation to improve my work status anymore, and I don't hit the gym or workout like I used to. My eating habits are messed up with an eating disorder that might slowly be killing me, which is okay with me at this point. 

Anxiety keeps me from moving forward with so many things. I can't get past so much. I constantly wonder what the root cause of my sadness is and can never dig it up so I feel like I can't and shouldn't do anything until I find it. And if I never find it, then my life will always be a waste. Meaningless, purposeless, failed. 

Ultimately, I don't want to be alive anymore. I am a waste of a person with no reason for being on this planet.",Coenum,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4q94b/small_vent/

* I got rejected following a job interview (been applying to get a job for when I finish my PhD)

* The other day I bumped my car on a rock that was in my blind spot and scraped it - minor thing but still annoying

* 2 of my housemates have “got together” - this only winds me up because I’ve been with my gf for 6 years now and still only get to see her at weekends and at a distance due to lockdown/Covid, yet my housemates seem to rub the fact they’ve got each-other in my face. I am happy for 1 of my housemates in this, because he’s been rejected a lot before - but the other basically doesn’t give me the time of day now they’re together

* The fact I don’t live with my girlfriend yet (due to Covid and my study commitments here)

There’s a few other things, but I find myself just getting so wound up about everything in life at the moment. Like the other day there were some youths congregating outside the house and it stressed me out. Part of me feels bad for getting down/stressed/anxious about these things because I know there’s people in much worse situations in the world than me, and it makes me question how I’ll actually cope when I have a real emergency.

8 years with constant anxiety (success),"My journey began when I was about 17 years old. I had always been a very anxious person, but nothing major and it certainly didn’t have a big impact in my life. I remember having a few episodes when I was younger where I would experience anxiety, but really nothing too big. My mom has always been an anxious person, so I think this kind of stuck with me a bit too. Back to me as a 17-year-old. At that time, I remember being a happy person and kind of “careless” in a way that, I didn’t think too much about life or consequences. You could call me selfish, careless and I didn’t really understand what it meant to feel bad or experience depression in a way. At this time, I started to experience anxiety in small waves. I don’t what triggered it, but it came in form of these obsessive thoughts. It could be thoughts about my sexuality, me hurting someone physically and just the thought of that created an anxious feeling in my body and mind. I didn’t really know what to do since I wasn’t familiar with this, and I didn’t really want share anything to anybody. For 1 year I kept in silence and I just kept experiencing these obsessive thoughts which caused a lot of anxiety in my body and mind. I felt so bad for myself since I was so young, and my friends were just doing so good both in school and mentally. I’m sure they had their problems, but I could just see them living their life while mine was slowly falling apart.

One day when I was about 18 years old my whole mind collapsed. I was with my girlfriend and all these obsessive thoughts just kept coming and creating so much anxiety in my mind, that I felt my head would blow up. I went to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror. I saw myself so scared and anxious, so I began to cry so much which kind of helped because I just felt something releasing from my body and mind. This is where my *nervous breakdown* began. I had no clue what to do and I couldn’t talk to my parents about this. They would never understand what I was going through. My girlfriend tried to help me and talk to me, but what was she going to do about it? She didn’t know anything about the anxiety I experienced so I didn’t blame her for not understanding.

At 18 I decided to contact a mental institution for teens. I got to talk to a psychiatrist which very quickly tried to offer me meds, so that my mind would calm, and we could work through it. I remember considering this, but I said no. I wanted to know what happened to me and why did this feeling choose me? I went to see my psychiatrist for about 2 years, 2 times a month. She didn’t really understand what was going on and most of our conversations were about my life and dreams. These meetings I had with her simply kept the anxiety a bit distanced, since I got to release some of my thoughts and fears. I still didn’t understand why it was happening to me and neither did my psychiatrist. 2 years went by and I kind of didn’t see any point in seeing her anymore, so I decided it was time to stop. The day I left; I had this empty feeling in my body. Remember, I was going there for 2 years to talk about a problem that had a huge impact in my life, but nobody understood me. My friends didn’t understand me, my teachers, family... Nobody.

My social life was okay, I guess. I had a few friends at that time and my girlfriend, but it just didn’t work out. I moved together with my girlfriend and the anxiety was just too much for me and her. I could feel that she really didn’t understand what was going on and why I kept crying every night for several years. Eventually I decided to leave her because I could see this wasn’t going to end well. I felt so bad inside, but I still somehow managed to live and ordinary life. I went to the local gym, tried to start school again, but I just had these periods of anxiety which always ended up ruining it for me. You may think, what kind of anxiety did I experience these years?EVERYTHING. Anything you can imagine. Obsessive thoughts, panic attack, depersonalization, general anxiety. All these symptoms combined into one negative spiral of anxiety. This can be hard to understand if you haven’t experienced it yourself, but it’s like being trapped in a nightmare.

This was meant to be the time of my life. Young and fearless, living life and dreaming big. My anxiety ruined it all for me. I couldn’t concentrate in school, I couldn’t keep a job, I just couldn’t keep anything for too long. I felt like this would be my life forever. When I turned 22, I tried contacting a psychologist. She tried to put the blame on my parents and my childhood. I never had a problem with my childhood though. Sure, my parents weren’t the wealthiest and we went through some hard times, but I remember having a great childhood. None of this made sense for me at the time, and it sure doesn’t to this day. I know, she tried the best, but I was still suffering so bad every single day and I wanted to feel good again. I tried everything. Contacting psychiatrists, psychologist, and all those quick-fix anxiety methods you could find.

At this point I just turned 23 years old. I was tired of my life and how anxiety was controlling my whole life in every aspect. I was tired of all the anxiety going through my mind all day long, from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. I had been searching a lot online at this time and I saw like anyone else, so many horrifying stories about people never being free of anxiety and suffering till the end. This was my biggest fear at that time. The fear of never being free and feeling like my old self again. I was addicted to reading stories on the internet and I always kept the success stories next to me just in case I felt bad. I still wanted my anxiety to disappear forever and be free quickly, but I slowly started reading about anxiety in a different way than I used to. I began searching about what caused anxiety to humans. It could be the outcome of stress, depression, and other things in your life that you didn’t take care of. I began to understand the cycle I got trapped in, back when I was 17. The obsessive thoughts I experienced at that time frightened me so much that I would distract myself every time I had them. I gave these thoughts so much power over me, and they just came back stronger and harder every single day. You can’t distract yourself forever trust me. I was creating so much anxiety in my mind and body by distracting myself, but I didn’t understand it at the time. I came across a person that probably suffered way more than I did. His name was Paul David. I remember first seeing his website where people would talk about their experiences and share success stories. At this point, I felt that there was hope out there. I quickly purchased his book *at last a life*, and I started reading and reading. Something in this book made sense for me in some way, and I tried to inhale all the information I could get from it. I had found a book that finally understood how I was feeling. My anxiety was still there at full blast, but I had finally found a man that went through the same journey as I was going through. This was the biggest relief I had ever experienced in my whole life. I can’t even explain to you how I felt at the moment.

At this time, I began to understand how anxiety works, but it wasn’t without many mistakes and errors. I still wanted my anxiety to be gone, but not in the same way as before. My main goal was to get out and experience as much anxiety as I could. I would have days where I gave up and stayed at home and other days where I felt like I conquered the world. This was all a part of my recovering process. It was filled with doubt, mistakes, and a lot of trying and crying. I began to understand that a lot of these feelings that I had in my body were just harmless feelings. I had been giving them so much attention and that’s why they controlled my life. Anxiety isn’t anything but at feeling. Of course, I felt bad at the time, but I had to go outside and get my life back. Was I going to let a feeling keep me from that? Definitely not.Going through this recovering phase was necessary for me. I experienced my depersonalization at the worst in some situations, but I would just try to let it pass and not bother freaking out. When you begin to recover from anxiety, you’ll see that you will have these “aha” moments. If I must give an explanation to this, it feels like you see through the anxiety. When I would let my anxiety pass instead of freaking out, I would get this feeling of “aha”, was that just it? It was just a feeling that I was hiding from. I had been hiding from anxiety for a long time so I knew that this process would take time. I didn’t set time on recovery because it would be counterproductive. My recovery wasn’t about getting rid of these terrible feelings of anxiety. My recovery was about FEELING my anxiety. I began putting Paul David’s book into practice and my understanding just grew time by time. As time went by anxiety just became to mean less and less to me. I began to stop reading about anxiety slowly, not worrying so much and I slowly stopped making everything about anxiety. I used to read about anxiety daily and constantly fill my mind with anxious information. Knowledge is the key to recovering and when you begin to understand anxiety, all of this will make sense to you, trust me. I don’t know why I decided to write a story about my life and my experiences with it. Maybe because it used to be my life. I’m 26 years old now and I wouldn’t trade my years with anxiety for anything in the world. This taught me so much about life and so much about myself. I just want to make it out to some people and tell them that there is hope and that you can recover.

I hope that my story can help someone and I will answer questions if you have any.",Apprehensive-Piece63,3,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4lzso/8_years_with_constant_anxiety_success/
Caffeine... I'm completely swearing off this poison,"I don't know what it is about caffeine that just makes my body breakdown.

I love Cola, and as much anxiety that it gives me, I still drink it because in my opinion, it is well worth it. I had four cans of Pepsi last night in a space of about 6 hours and it just completely broke me down. I started feeling anxious... which is nothing out of the ordinary, but this time, it persisted for hours, even while I layed back and tried to go to sleep.

Now, after hours of tossing and turning, I am going to go work with no sleep and although my anxiety is mostly gone now, that's no longer the issue. I'm already irritated and since my job is very mind-task centered, I know I'm going to screw up.

Panic disorder and a tornado hitting my house last night...,"Diagnosed a month ago and life has been off since. Some days, I’m kind of okay, other days I have attacks that make me want to call an ambulance.

I’m house sitting for my parents and taking care of my elderly grandma and my parents dogs...Plus, my two dogs and my 8 year old (who also has anxiety/extreme fears.) Last night, the tornado warning started so I was standing in the garage watching after I put everyone in the bathroom. The whole storm got eerily quiet all of a sudden and I saw the shape of the tornado coming towards the house and my sisters house up the road when some lighting struck. The power shut off in the middle of this. Guys....My heart almost beat out of my chest while my hands shook. I’m the baby of the family, but had my older sisters calling me for advice...My parents were 2 hours south of us so it was just me and my husband trying to take care of everyone. I live in Arkansas, I should be used to things like this...I always thought I was prepared. I got us through it and then my poor son had a panic attack to the point of vomiting. I was so afraid “this is it for him....he’s going to be like me. He’s not going to feel normal again for a long time just like me.”

But he woke up this morning...as happy as ever. Playing his game and excited about living through a tornado. Why can’t we be more like children? Why are we so affected by panic attacks that we have one and then feel sick and off for days after?

Need help with anxiety,"I have relationship and social anxiety. This seemed to start when I started questioning my sexuality 3 years ago. Every day since then, I am consumed by negative thoughts and fears about my relationship with others, past, present and future. My anxiety amplifies when I think about how I am unable to connect to other people and the “what if’s” in previous interactions. I get anxious when I think about how unromantic I am and I can’t give love to others, and feel unloveable at the same time. I get anxious when I don’t know where I stand with people. I get anxious because I don’t know if I like boys or girls and I obsess over my sexual orientation on the daily. I feel like a garbage of a human being. I’ve tried self-help books, mindfulness, meditation, and CBT. Nothing ever seems to work and I’m growing impatient.

"my story with an anxiety disorder, looking for people who can relate","I have had pretty awful anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD as a teenager, and have been in and out of treatment ever since, struggling with intermittent depression. I am 27 now and just feel so lost. Went back to therapy this year just to feel like I was at least trying to get my mental health under control, but even with all of the coping mechanisms I have learned, I can't seem to break out of this awful feeling. I keep thinking I'm doing a little better, but each time my anxiety ""flares up"" again, it feels worse than the last. I'm in a really awful place right now, probably because I just found out my 5 year old cat has a heart murmur and I need to take her to have a echocardiogram. I am terrified they are going to find something seriously wrong with her. If that happens, I don't know how I will be able to handle it emotionally. I haven't been able to stop crying since I found out.

Last time I felt this bad, I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital. I hoped I would finally get the help I needed, but the experience was very unhelpful, and probably just caused me even more stress and confusion than anything. I have had a lot of bad experiences with various psych meds, and recently found out it may be due to the fact that I have a seizure disorder. Still gave Cymbalta a shot a couple weeks ago, but the migraines I had (which is how I was diagnosed with epilepsy - lamictal made them go away entirely) came back and I couldn't keep food down, so I had to stop it. I feel like I'm just out of options at this point. I really hoped I would never be at a point this low again, but here I am. I'm desperate to try something, but am struggling to find either a psychiatrist of psychologist who accepts my insurance.

On top of all this, I have had a lot of possible diagnoses sorta tossed at me without ever actually being diagnosed with any of them. I've had therapists suggest things like bipolar disorder. I have tried to ask people if some of the difficult things I experience are a part of my OCD or something else, but no one has any suggestions for me. I have been told to look into being evaluated for ASD, something my mom suspected when I was a toddler, but am struggling to find someone who will evaluate an adult for this. Keep reaching out to people and they just never get back to me. Just feel like I've hit a wall and am drowning in anxiety, slipping into paranoia. Like something inside me is going to explode at any minute. I can't focus on anything or figure out how to spend my time productively. Every second feels impossible. I feel terrible for my boyfriend with whom I live for putting him through my misery.

Not sure why I'm writing this here exactly, maybe just looking for some people who can relate / a sense of community. Social anxiety has made reaching out to people really difficult. I want to practice my social skills. I don't know. Thanks for reading, though",humanoidvoid,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4tey0/my_story_with_an_anxiety_disorder_looking_for/

"I genuinely WANT to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but I'm absolutely TERRIFIED of it now.","Before y'all read my thread I just wanna say this isn't really a subreddit I've visited before; I mostly use my reddit account for memes, games, etc. so I wasn't really sure where else to post this after looking at a few different subreddits; with that said I apologize if this happens to be in an inappropriate subreddit or if I'm violating any rules here (If so feel free to take this down mods), I just need somewhere to express my feelings and I'm guessing this is a proper place to do so.

Some additional background that may be helpful: I'm 20M, currently a college student (I'm not a med or biology student), and have struggled with anxiety and depression before, but thankfully not on a large scale for several years now. I follow all COVID regulations too, and I am absolutely not anti-mask, anti-vax, and anything like that.

I'm not sure if conspiracy theories can be a trigger for some people, but in case they are I'll put that flair on this thread. If conspiracy theories are a trigger for you, please do not read my thread.

So as the title suggests, I want to get the COVID shots but I'm **really, really scared** to get it now. My viewpoint with the vaccine has evolved over the past few months and especially the past few days, and this is what each phase so far for me has been:

1. Thank God these are being rolled out for the elderly, vulnerable, and essential workers, but maybe I don't really need this; I'm healthy and active as I possibly can be during the pandemic, so I think I can just depend on herd immunity being reached. (Nov 2020 - Feb 2021)
2. Maybe I could get the shot(s) to help contribute to herd immunity. I'm not too sure right now, so I'll wait until enough of my friends, enough people that I follow on social media, and enough of the general population has had it to a point where it seems to be safe and effective for everyone. (Feb 2021 - Apr 2021)
3. My threshold for seeing if it's safe and effective among other people has now been met, and after having done about 2-3 hours of some research, it seems to be very safe and effective. I plan to have my first Pfizer shot on May 5th, and my second one May 26th (A few days ago - Yesterday)
4. I genuinely don't know what to do. I really want to get this, but I'm really scared about what some of these conspiracies say. (Today)

Allow me to break down what led me to point #4

Basically, a lot of my family right now does not fully support the COVID vaccine. They aren't anti-vax or anything like that, but they are highly skeptical of the COVID vaccine. They also do not oppose other people getting the vaccine either, as they believe it's up each individual. Right now, both my parents and my older brother and sister do not plan on getting it. On the contrary, I have a sister-in-law who is pregnant but does plan on getting the Pfizer vaccine as soon as her child is born. I also have two younger sisters that are currently ineligible for the shot, but one of them will probably get it when she becomes eligible presumably later this summer. My mom's parents have been fully vaccinated since February (even though they are more skeptical of vaccines in general), but to my knowledge nobody else in my extended family has the vaccine or is planning to get it.

I thought my parents had every right to know; I am their kid after all so I'd figured I'd let them know. The day I decided to schedule my appointment for the vaccine, I told my mom. She is not opposed to me getting it at all, although she hasn't been fully supportive either necessarily. She still does not plan on considering getting it until there are more long term studies on the vaccine, and her threshold for the amount of people who have it and are safe and ok is much higher than mine was.

The next day, I told my dad. He apparently is far more opposed to the vaccine than my mom (and probably everyone else in my immediate family), and when I told him, me and him launched into a debate for about an hour over the vaccine, talking about its effectiveness, safety, and legitimacy. He talked about how he believes the vaccine contains materials that the government and companies are hiding, that it can harm your immune system, and some of the conspiracy theories behind it, particularly how Bill Gates is supposedly deeply involved in the vaccine. I made it clear to him that I didn't make the decision lightly and did 2-3 hours of research for a reason. By the end of it all, he asked me if I could sit down with him and a regular client of his (my dad is a small business owner) for lunch to discuss the vaccine. I thought that the guy could maybe have some legitimate points, and that having more information to consider isn't necessarily a bad thing, so I thought why not, at least do it for my dad, who was genuinely worried about me and my health should I get the vaccine.

Today was said lunch with my dad and his client, who is a dentist who treats his patients holistically (or something along those lines) and has apparently done research on various vaccines for years. After introducing himself, he immediately proceeded to ask me the question ""Do you want to have kids?"". I naturally said yes; one of my life goals is to hopefully find the perfect girl, get married, and start a family one day. He then immediately said, ""Don't get the vaccine. Simple as that."" After that, he immediately proceeded to launch into a very big talk about a bunch of different supposed dangers with the vaccines. He also then proceeded to discuss that the vaccines and the pandemic are part of a conspiracy.

**Let me make it clear that I logically do** ***NOT*** **believe any of these following points.** All of these points I'm about to list are the primary factors that have launched this massive anxiety in me about the vaccine. Additionally, these are not all the points he discussed. I had a mental breakdown immediately following this talk and a lot of the conversation then became a blur in my memory. Here are some of those points he was claiming that I can remember, not in any particular order:

* The vaccine contains a material/ingredient (I forget the name) that is hidden from the general public that leaves both males and females who take the vaccines infertile, most likely permanently
* The reason behind this is to control the population and eventually reduce the global population to only 2 billion people
* The mRNA in the vaccine DOES interact with the DNA and DOES make permanent changes to the DNA, contrary to what the FDA and official sources say. I don't recall why.
* The mRNA in the vaccines causes a gene that helps fight cancerous cells in the human body to become permanently disabled, therefore dramatically increasing the possibility of cancer in the human body. The dramatically higher cancer rates are part of the plan to control and reduce the population.
* He claimed he knew people that said 5 local pregnant women in one suburb alone were forced to abort their fetuses because they all miscarried as a result of taking the vaccine
* He said one of his patients had a husband who was 40 years old, was an athlete in perfect health, and died in his sleep three weeks after receiving the COVID vaccine
* The vaccine interacts with only one of two parts of the immune system, leaving the immune system unbalanced while it produces the antibodies the vaccine instructs the immune system to make. As a result of this, if you are vaccinated and catch COVID-19, it could send your body into shock and kill you.
* The virus was released in 2020 in order to help elect Joe Biden and remove Donald Trump from office (I don't mean to start any political discussions)
* The virus was also released in order to largely increase mail-in voting and early voting in order to more easily rig the election in swing states (again, I don't mean to start any political discussions)
* To add to the point above, he said the current (?) audit in Arizona is legitimate and will find Trump the winner there
* Robert Kennedy (I don't remember who he is other than the fact he is a descendent of JFK) opposes the COVID vaccine and is trying to sound the alarm on how harmful this thing is
* Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci have thousands of patents on each COVID vaccine, and are profiting tremendously from the vaccine rollout (and the pandemic in general)
* ""Big Pharma's"" intentions with the vaccine are **only** to make profit, not to help end the pandemic
* Potential booster shots for 6-12 months down the line are only for Big Pharma to make more profit
* Pfizer and Moderna have apparently been caught in scandals before about lying about their stats. As such, Pfizer and Moderna lied about their statistics from the vaccine trials in order to get their vaccines approved
* Anthony Fauci was involved in the development of a virus at a lab in the United States, but the creation of said virus was moved to Wuhan in 2005 after the US government became suspicious
* COVID-19 absolutely did not originate in a wet market or from bats
* ALL the current COVID-19 vaccines were based on vaccines for different animals.
* The J&amp;J vaccine in particular was based on a vaccine that was abandoned by J&amp;J due to it being largely deadly for the monkeys said vaccine was meant for
* The Ebola outbreak a few years back was a test to see how the general population would react to a large-scale outbreak of a virus
* The current narratives on the COVID pandemic are meant to only instill fear in the general population to further cement control over the general public
* Masking and social distancing are completely useless
* The vast majority of vaccines have not benefitted humanity in the slightest, they have only worsened humanity and the human immune system
* Peanut allergies, gluten allergies, and other ""newer"" allergies have been caused by the large amount of vaccinations given to young children
* More children are becoming disabled due to the increasing amounts of vaccinations young children receive
* Young children today receive dozens of more vaccines compared to just a few years ago and this will make young children extremely sickly in the future
* The Polio vaccine, among others, have caused new variations of polio and other diseases
* A vaccine distributed by Bill Gates and his foundation in Africa (I do not remember for which disease) caused thousands of young women to become infertile
* HIV originated from a vaccine distributed in the 50s and 60s (I don't remember which one he said)
* The vaccine rollout ultimately is an experiment on the entire human population
* The ultimate endgame is for elites in various governments to gain totalitarian control of the government and usher in a ""new world order"" through ""the great reset""

**Again, I want to make it clear that I do** ***NOT*** **logically believe** ***ANY*** **of this to be true. These are the points that are feeding into my anxiety about the vaccine.**

The conversation lasted roughly an hour, and for the first 20 minutes or so, I would try and ask questions such as ""Why would they hide this?"", ""What is their endgame?"", ""Why would they even do this?"", and ""What do these people have to gain from doing all this?"". Eventually I gave up on asking questions and just let the man ramble on, because his answers were always either ""Well they want to control us"" or ""They are trying to hide things from us"" or something related to one of those two answers.

Following the conversation, I had a full on mental breakdown that lasted roughly an hour. The last time I suffered a mental breakdown of this scale was back in 2017 when I was struggling with anxiety and depression. I broke down because in that moment my faith in humanity had been completed wiped out by all the supposed evil, horrific things all these people were doing to harm their fellow man and gain wealth and power for themselves. If I'm being completely honest, the thought I had deep down was that I did not want to live in a world where that much evil exists (I'm ok now, I promise).

The way he talked about all those points and moved from one point to another was done so quickly, confidently, and eloquently in a way that just made it seem all so legitimate to me, even though I know it's a bunch of nonsense realistically speaking. He backed himself up by saying he has viewed dozens of different research papers and articles, and claims he knows many different people with negative experiences with the vaccine. I suppose the man technically is a doctor after all, even if he is a dentist.

But it just doesn't make sense to me. There can't be that many people in on a plan to harm and gain control over the general population; in my opinion, you would need tens of thousands of people, and with that many people in on it, people WOULD TALK! These scientists who developed the vaccine want to HELP AND NOT HARM humanity, and yet he made it seem the opposite was true so easily and with massive confidence.

That's the logical side of me refuting what he said, but despite how much I refute any of his points, the anxiety just does not go away. I can't help but have this feeling of **""what if it's all true?""** and worry deep down that if/when I get my COVID vaccine, I'm injecting a vaccine in me that will compromise my immune system, dramatically increase my chances of getting cancer, and eliminate my ability to one day start a family. I just can't stop thinking about the possible ""consequences"" I'd now be getting if I get the COVID vaccine.

I just do not genuinely know what to do. Before I had this conversation, I decided to get the COVID vaccine for a few reasons:

1. I figured I'd take my chances with a vaccine that appears to have no long term side effects according to research (that my dad's client would presumably call bullcrap) over my chances of dealing with ""Long COVID"" if I somehow got COVID, which is very real according to research
2. To contribute to overall herd immunity
3. To not have to quarantine for 14 days were I to be exposed to COVID
4. To help prevent my family, friends, and society as a whole from getting COVID
5. To go and see my (vaccinated) friends again and hopefully return to some sense of normal this summer or fall

I just really do not know what to do. I have talked to some of my closest friends about this situation and they have all shown support for me and listened to all this, which I'm extremely grateful for. Additionally, my dad apologized profusely for the conversation. It is my belief my dad was expecting me and his client to have a proper debate/conversation about the vaccine, rather than the eloquent conspiracy rampage that he ultimately went on. The guy gave me a folder containing a few articles in favor against the COVID vaccines, but my dad told me ""You do not have to read anything in here. If you get the shot and don't read any of this, I'll still fully support you."" That truly meant a lot to me, especially coming off of the mental breakdown I had right in front of him.

But ever since this conversation, I have had the anxiety of the COVID vaccine and all these supposed effects on myself deep down. I have nearly reached the point to where I almost just want to get the shot in order to force myself to think ""well I have the shot now, no going back"" instead of thinking ""what if?"". On top of that, I've also reached the point to where my logic and anxiety have sort of blended in a weird way. The big examples of that would be my thoughts of ""Well if the vaccine shuts off my ability to have children, ***good***. I don't want to have kids be born into a world of such evil anyway."" and ""If it kills me, well then I don't have to live in a world where the elites are trying to kill me anymore"". I know those thoughts are extremely unhealthy, but my anxiety has gotten so bad and I have had this conversation and my rebuttals to the conversation going through my mind so much that it's all just started to all come together so my brain can reach a conclusion and just ***stop*** thinking about it for one second.

I'm still currently scheduled to get my first shot on May 5th, which is most likely tomorrow if you are reading this thread. I don't know what to do with that appointment at this point in time.

But I guess that's about all the big points of what I've had to say. I know this thread is extremely long, so even if you've only managed to read this entire thing, **thank you so much from the bottom of my heart**. I just needed to express my feelings somewhere, and I feel like having some opinions of different people would be very productive and useful in helping me make a ***confident*** decision that is healthy for my mental health, physical health, and the health and wellbeing of others.",TheArcticNebula,5,16,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4hpcb/i_genuinely_want_to_get_the_covid19_vaccine_but/

Crying over my birthday,"Hiya, so my birthday is in June and I hate it I always try organise to work my birthday so that I can completely ignore it.
But this year and last year it is a little hard to do that seeing as we're in a pandemic and I have been out of work for over a year. 
I don't seam to really have much to any friends. Last year I felt I had a solid 3 friends the most Ive had in a couple years I wanted to have a little sesh for my birthday so I invited them and a couple more from my college year over and that whole experience felt like when you are a child in primary school and you invite everyone in your class over and your class mates are forced by there parents to show up. It was quite depressing.
I feel so awkward and embarrassed about my birthday.
Another issue I have with my birthday is about the Instagram posts you know the ones people post on there stories tbh I think they are super cute and no hate but I get super embarrassed when I have only the one post from my boyfriend or my sister it's kinda awkward and last year I remember my boyfriend commented on the fact only 3 or 4 people posted about my birthday I then got a lil defencesive as I am a lil self conscious about having no friends (especially on Birthday x) so I tried to cover it up by telling him most people just sent me a happy birthday text. 
but honestly It sucks being alone on your birthday

I'm 19F and this started on may 1st when I was feeling feverish and had a little bodyache so I contacted my doctor and asked him what to do so he told me to take a tablet and meet him the next day so I went there and even did the swab test for covid and did a CRP blood test and the results for the swab test came out negative and not detected and then i was fine and just living normally taking the suggested medicines he told me to take but today the CRP test results came out and the protein was high(? I don't really know what that means) and said that I can have covid so I've been told to stay in isolation for 3 days and then go and do the test again on Friday 

My problem is that as being Someone who has such severe anxiety this doesn't help one bit cause I don't know if this is a symptom for covid or just my anxiety for example the shortness of breathing part I can't tell which is which and checking it on that oxymeter makes my anxiety worse so much worse this is absolutely sickening I hate vague statements is it there or not it's just really frustrating",Literallyno1201,1,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4rjec/do_i_have_covid_or_not_or_is_my_anxiety_just/

Anxiety and caffeine are a bad mix,"(I'm not sure how to flair this, sorry) (repost after title mistake)
Last week was INSANE, I had so much to do and so many assignments and tests I only survived because had to 2 extra Monter cans stored(btw the iced tea one is not good), but when friday came (my only kinda free day) I was so tired I slept all day and missed therapy and I REALLY needed therapy Friday. Well, I slept the whole weekend and I can't believe it's still Tuesday.

Well, yesterday I bought some caffeine pills because they are way cheaper them energy drinks and it was probably not a good choice. I took one at 8pm, but it's now 5am. I'm not sure if it's the pill having a late kick in or the anxiety, either way I can't sleep and I can't focus enough to study.

The worst part is that I don't even like caffeine, I rarely drink coffee and all enegy drinks taste the same to me, but lately it started to look like a pretty good choice for late study sessions and it really helped the first few times, except it's also a very sucky choice for anxiety.

Also, my psychiatrist is going to kill me after I tell him about the pills, unless my therapist is kill me first since I told him a few weeks ago I'd never have a monster again.

There's more to it, but I'm too lazy to type it now. The important part is: be very careful with caffeine and anxiety, it's definitely not a good combination",Dramatic-Baker3035,5,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4j0ae/anxiety_and_caffeine_are_a_bad_mix/

I think I might’ve stumbled upon possibly underaged porn on xvideos and I’m freaking out and it triggered my anxiety,"I was scrolling through xvideos and came across a thumbnail for one of the videos which they looked under the age of 18. Definitely not kid kids but they looked underage. The thing is I have a huge fear of stumbling upon cp and I had looked at the sites policy’s before and they specifically said they only allowed 18+ videos on the site and any underage content would be removed. I reported the video but it said the content creator was a verified creator so contact them if I have a problem. On top of the fact that the video was in the twink category and those people look younger. I doubt a verified creator would post cp, But what bothered be was “young boys” were in the title which completely triggered me. They just looked young man. Mid teens rather than 18+. 

Since then I’ve been in so much anxiety that I had just seen underage porn and I just need someone to help me out. This has happened before, where I was on xvideos and a questionable thumbnail of a video came up and it scared me so much I was worried sick all night that I had laid eyes on potential cp. Thankfully people on reddit checked it out and helped me and said the people who made the video were legal adults.

Now I’m just not gonna go on xvideos again, not because they have underaged porn cuz The last one wasn’t even underage and this one might not be either and their policy is strictly against that. But because my anxiety is so bad that anything slightly questionable will trigger me and cause me to have severe anxiety. 

Please if anyone could help me or message me or  give me a second opinion or something idk I just want to calm down from this. I’ve been worried completely sick over this I feel like I’m going crazy.

We bought a car. I didn’t freak out!,"A few months ago I made the mistake of casually saying, so my wife, “maybe we should think about new cars.” Ever since, she has been looking and planning. 

Today we traded in my car and got a new one. I felt prepared and ready.  And I didn’t have a panic attack or have my anxiety shut me down. 

Our sales person was great, joking with us, chit chatting, having a pretty good time. So far no anxiety, just normal nervousness. 

Now here’s the hard part. So far no pressure. so I’m thinking, this is going to be a great day. It was actually the finance guy that was being pushy!  My wife, who doesn’t have anxiety, she’s my rock, said that she was getting so irritated and pissed off at him. We had to say no, listen to his pitch three times! Just take the no already! I was about to walk away, and say no deal.   

But I made it. Phew. I feel very stressed right now (still) but never hit that anxiety attack level! I’m pretty proud of myself. This is the first time EVER that I was able to make a large purchase without an attack.

I overanalyze how people speak to me and convince myself they hate me.,"I'm sure this is a common occurrence, but one of the ways my anxiety portrays itself is by overanalyzing my interactions with people- more commonly those I don't know too well, but sometimes even friends I've had for years. I'll say something or ask them a question, and if their response seems in any sense ""dry"" or ""annoyed"", i'll convince myself that I irritate them or they don't like me but just don't have the decency to tell me. In a sense, I don't always mind because I believe I am quite perceptive of others feelings and emotions, and it helps me to be more conscious and empathetic. On the other hand, sometimes it can be a real burden, causing me to get super in my head and only able to focus on that, feeling so bad that I did something to bother/disappoint/ gain the disliking of someone. It definitely has a lot to do with caring too much about what others think, insecurity, and self worth issues. Yesterday I was telling some of my friends who know I suffer from anxiety about how I get the sense that one of our friends doesn't like me. In response I just got ""Why do you even care?"" ""You just like conflict, nobody's gonna give you attention 24/7"" in which I understand their point, but it also kind of just hurt my feelings. Am I being too dramatic?

He kept checking the time saying he had a 1.5 hour drive home and had to go, but I convinced him to get a lap dance. We went back there and I was dancing and grinding on him. He took out his dick and asked if I'd suck it for 100$, I told him no, but I would touch him. We didn't end up doing anything. I just grinded on him over his clothes. I didn't even touch his penis when he pulled it out. He asked me if the club has ever got shut down before for stuff, I told him no. When we walked out he asked me what days I worked and I lied. Does this sound like a sting operation? We never went in the VIP room , he only did one lap dance. He also danced with a few other girls. But I never saw him go in the back room.

I think quarantine caused me to develop this,"Going back to Early 2020, my grandfather who I was very close with and was at his house everyday, passed away, it was a big part of my life and a very sad time I will never forget.

Shortly after I’m forced into online highschooling, only to be like that for the rest of the year and It’s still going on. 

At first it was nice getting a break from everything going on, but being inside so much put me so out of touch from reality and it was like the death never happened. 

Next down the road in about October I just randomly start getting very anxious and nervous for no reasons at all, I try to figure out why and I just cant, sometimes to the point where I’ll start freaking out and have an attack. Almost to points where I thought I would black out.

To this day things have gotten a bit better, the nerves still fluctuate but I’m an introverted person and the last thing I want to do is go on meds, just hoping it will get better with time. 

Just wanted to hear my story and to see if this was similar to anyone else’s symptoms because I’m not too sure if it’s anxiety or not.",SKOK2628,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4lh6d/i_think_quarantine_caused_me_to_develop_this/

I only live with one parent and we are extremely poor and I don’t know if we can even afford to pay the fee whatever it is. I hope it’s not a thousand dollars. I made an email to the school and it’s all I can think about now. I’m such an idiot for ghosting a school and making them hold a spot for me. No one in my family has ever gone to college so I never got any help with college advice. School being solely online is also extremely scary to me and is why I decided to take a gap year.

My experience as a student with severe anxiety,"I’m going to preface this post by saying that it has no real structure and is a mix of ranting and asking for support. I talk like I’m looking back on my teenage self from the perspective of a 45 year old man and I’m not really sure why.

I am currently a junior in high school. Over the course of my time spent in high school, I’ve taken a majority AP classes with some honors classes thrown in. My teachers told me and my classmates that hard classes were the key to getting into a good college and that nowadays everybody who attended a good college had a 4.0 or higher so your classes needed to be harder to show your drive. I knew that getting into college had gotten incredibly competitive but I didn’t know it was to the point where having 10 - 12 AP classes with high A’s and B’s was normal. Before I go into more detail about my personal experience with this academic culture I want to say that I have no problem with putting in the work and this post is not meant to disguise a lack of effort or laziness as anxiety because I believe there is a relatively clear line between anxiety and not wanting to work hard. Anyway, as a junior I’ve taken 8 AP classes and have always pushed myself to make A’s because I had been told that that’s what is took to succeed in life. I know that millions of people make lower grades and take easier classes and still manage to do just as well if not better in life than those who pushed them in school. Despite this is still pushed myself to make only A’s in the hardest classes. I’ve never been good at managing stress about my grades so I always just buried it under more work and harder classes. Around September of 2019 I began waking up at night or early morning in cold sweats often dreading a test or fearing that I had forgotten to turn in an assignment. I developed a terrible lack of trust in myself which often manifested as having to check my google classroom at 1:00 am to make sure that I had turned in an assignment or having to rework every test question 3 times to make sure I circled the right answer. This cycle continued until about November of 2019 when I woke up one morning and immediately threw up. For the next  months I woke every morning and would throw up. My sleeping schedule broke down further and my eating habits basically stopped. Over those months I lost 20 pounds and continued to force myself to work more. I knew that what I was doing was bad but I honestly didn’t know how to fix it. People had told me that making B’s were gone and that most employers don’t care about stupid numbers like a GPA but I couldn’t convince my self that this was true. Dozens of people had to told me to relax because “Your just a kid” but I never could. I’m writing cause I figured that venting might help but I’m not sure at this point.
I’ve found myself feeling incredibly depressed almost all the time because of feeling overworked but knowing that it’s how I have to feel in order to get into a good college. I tell myself that taking a break is a good thing but never manage to to actually take one. Anyway I’m gonna wrap this up cause I feel like I’m reacting myself as this point. I guess in short I simply don’t know what to do about this stress.",Boat_Guy1234,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4km22/my_experience_as_a_student_with_severe_anxiety/
I asked for medication even though I felt like my anxiety wasn’t “bad” enough and I’m so proud of myself!,"TW: self-harm

I’ve been going to therapy for almost a year now. I’ve learned multiple ways of coping with my anxiety, setting boundaries, and understanding my own emotions and feelings. I slowly started learning how to not feel out of control when my anxiety levels are higher and it has been incredible. 
However, the last couple of months I felt like my anxiety has had a higher baseline. I swear some days there is a buzz that never goes away. It has even gotten to the point where the thought of cutting has slipped into my thoughts now and then (it’s been 2 years this week since the last time, and I have no desire to cut again so I’m good y’all 🙏 ). But the fact that I had, when it’s been months since the last time I thought about  it, was a little scary. 
It made me realize that even though I could manage and deal with my anxiety much more effectively on a day to day basis, that doesn’t mean my underlying anxiety level would go away or not increase. I had been debating about asking my therapist about medication. I was worried that I didn’t have a high enough level of anxiety for me to need medication, that I still have anxiety because I’m not doing enough to “get over it,” and even that I may not actually have anxiety at all. 
Then this last weekend, I couldn’t enjoy taking one single day off from school work (I’m in grad school) to hang out with friends. I kept nearly crying and had shortness of breath all day. The night before I was laying in bed sobbing while my girlfriend just held me until I feel asleep. I was finally fed-up with dealing it with it almost every single day since as long as I can remember. So when I had my therapy session today, I let my therapist know that I thought medication would be helpful for me, and she agreed!! It made me feel like I haven’t been making up what I’ve been feeling or exaggerating it which was such a relief. I have a meeting next week to connect with a psychiatrist and hopefully figure out some medication soon! 
If you have actually read this far and have any advice/tips/comments about starting medication I’d love to hear them. I mainly wanted to share here because reading through posts on this sub helped me feel comfortable enough asking my therapist about medication. I hope this will maybe help others do the same

TLDR: I started going to therapy, learned some good coping skills, but still experienced a baseline anxiety. I frequently doubt if I have anxiety or just worry about things, but I finally asked my therapist about medication and she agreed that it would be helpful!",strawspiderflower,3,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4ff4s/i_asked_for_medication_even_though_i_felt_like_my/

Advice for dealing with anxiety,"I’m a 14F who has GAD.

My dad just asked me to go downstairs and watch a show, and I agreed. He said we were going to watch it in his bedroom, which I was uncomfortable with, and so I asked if we could watch it in the living room instead. He refused, and we argued for a bit. He refused to explain why he wouldn’t watch it in the living room, which made me more uncomfortable (I did not explain I was uncomfortable.). I sat on the floor instead of in the bed to avoid touching him, and he got upset, calling me a bad daughter and selfish.

What can I do to help “heart attack” anxiety?,"For about 5-6 years I’ve been going to the ER about 3 times probably a year thinking that Im having a heart attack. After multiple scans and all that they never find anything wrong, the closest I’ve had to an actual diagnosis was costochondritis (inflammation of rib cartilage). 

This morning I was woken up with heart attack symptoms - chest tightness, short of breath, left arm weakness and tingling ect.

I was really close to paying another visit to the ER but as usual after about 40 minutes the symptoms have eased. I did the 4-7-8 breathing. My arm and legs still feel strange but the chest tightness has eased and I feel more relaxed.

Im sick of this, as I always instantly go into “im having a heart attack” mode. And I always feel like I waste the doctor’s time, even though thats what they’re there for and its always better to be safe. But I cant help like Im wasting their time you know?

Does anyone have any advice on what I could do during these attacks? I do the breathing but is there anything else?

HOW THE FUCK DO YOU PEOPLE LIVE WITH EXTREME ANXIETY WITHOUT MEDS. It’s like my life is just permanent adrenaline rush. The chest pain never ever goes away I’m sick and tired of being so uncomfortable cuz it feels like my heart is malfunctioning and I feel my heartbeat throughout my whole body. It’s like I’m plugged into the wall and there’s to much electricity inside of me. and when I get panic attacks for no reason they just happen, every heart beat feels like a fucking demon is pulling apart my soul in my chest and my heart, I also get really bad palpitations and my blood pressure goes to 170/100 when I get bad panic attacks, and my veins get these like bumps that look like beads in them it’s scary. They happen once nearly every other day. My doc won’t put me on anxiety meds cuz I used to be addicted to drugs, if I did have meds I would not at all abuse them. Benzodiazepines really help the anxiety a lot they don’t make it go away but it makes it atleast manageable and I don’t get “high” on them at all they just make me feel okay since I don’t have to feel insane pain every fucking day.

Toilet urgency anxiety tips and tricks,"So for a few years now, I've been hit with an urgency to go to the bathroom that hits me mostly when I am away from my house. If I am in a place where I can't easily access a bathroom, I get really bad anxiety that makes me need to go more. Restaurants that don't have bathrooms are the worst by far as I am stuck at the table for an indefinite amount of time. This quickly spirals and can make me lose focus of others around me and ultimately is quite stressful.  I know breathing is supposed to help but it is quite difficult when you start to get phantom physical sensations in the bladder.

Help with a fear that I have since 2 years ago,"(Trigger alert. I would like to tell that English is not my first language, so gramatical errors can appear, sorry xD)


So, i'm 16M and i do therapy since March 2021 because of a fear that i have about being robbed or worse. Why? Let's go back to 2019, when I was 14.

My aunt's house suffered practically a heist that i think has been planned some days before this happened. The thieves were armed, pointing the guns to my relatives in this house and they taked everything (luckily they managed to recover almost everything they lost). Weirdly, in that time, i was a bit scared but for the rest of the year I was not thinking about this anymore because i was occupied with school and another chores. I started to have this fear by March 2020, when my school closed (pandemic issues).

So why i'm scared for a thing that NOT happened with my on my house with my family? Simple, i'm always thinking that this COULD happened to me. Everytime. Because of this, i started to fear night, my doors open at night and anything related to robbery and bad people breaking into my house. Sadly this is a reality on my country on dangerous cities and places but i live on a ""peaceful"" town. 

I had a series of episodes of anxiety crisis on nights and thanks to reading some breathing tactics on this subreddit i managed to ease these situations, so this is an little advance.

Gotta get some thoughts out of my head,"Hi all,
21 yo male here with diagnosed with GAD for a few years now. I've been taking Prozac since I was diagnosed and while it has helped my anxiety immensely, it's come with some very embarrassing and frustrating side effects, the most being it killing my ability to come...I had a girl over to my apartment for the first time in a while and she was gorgeous, and we got into it and we're having a great time. Fast forward about an hour plus and we're still going. She stops it and excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and comes back wanting to go home. She sits on the bed next to me and says ""sorry you didn't...you know..."" And I brushed it off like ""I have a bunch of stamina"" or whatever and then drove her home. I feel incredibly embarrassed and am hating myself. I have Welbutrin to counteract these effects but since I didn't wake up expecting to get laid I didn't take it and it's begun this negative thought cycle of hating the way I am. I wish every single day to be neurotypical...do I have it as bad as some people do? Not even close. But, I just wish I didn't need medication to get my emotions under control in the first place. I know this is irrational, but it's difficult for me to focus on anything else at the moment. I doubt I'll hear back from her at all, which just has me feeling worse about myself. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far. Hope you all are doing well or as well as can be given your current situation.

Could anyone offer advice? I'm TERRIFIED of the future...,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post in the Anxiety community of reddit. I've been lurking for months, though, and I need advice. Badly.  
Lately I have been experiencing crippling anxiety (both health anxiety and general anxiety). I just had a breakdown about 30 minutes ago thinking about the future.  
I am so UNBELIEVABLY terrified of the future. I am currently dating a beautiful girlfriend, who I love, and I have an amazing family. I'm going to marry my girlfriend one day, probably some day soon (I'm 21), and I am horrified of one day losing her.  
I'll outright say it: I am terrified of watching her, one day, pass away before I do. I don't want to marry someone and live my life with someone just for them to pass away and leave me all alone. This is so ridiculously frightening to me. I've had thoughts like these before in the past for my parents and siblings (especially my little brother), but recently my anxiety has been worse than it has ever been.   


I also understand and value life more than I ever have, but due to extreme health anxiety (aka hypochondria) I haven't been able to feel comfortable since Mid January at this point. I know there is a subreddit specific to health anxiety, so I won't go into it too deep here, but I have essentially worried continuously that some kind of debilitating illness will either kill me or permanently change my life in a bad way.  


My anxiety is ruining my life. It's making me feel symptoms that probably aren't actually there, and it's ruining some of the relationships of those closest to me... even hurting my relationship with my girlfriend.  


Has anyone gotten through something similar to this? Does anyone have advice that could help? Please... share anything you think could be beneficial.  
As for what I'm doing besides asking reddit for help: I'm looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and going to my doctor for a Health Anxiety or GAD diagnosis. I've been hesitant (anxious) to commit to either choice yet, but I'm hoping reddit could sway me.",GoldenBlade9,2,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4d09k/could_anyone_offer_advice_im_terrified_of_the/

How to end my relationship with Dr. google,"Dr. google and I have a very toxic relationship. He gaslights me a lot, and convinces me of a lot of things that aren't true. He ruined my weekend by convincing me my boyfriend was dying of Marfans Syndrome, and is still ruining my Monday with this nonsense.

My friend commented this weekend that my boyfriend looks like he could have marfans. He only has a few characteristics, but now I'm full blown down the rabbit hole. Dr. Google and I have been having a field day. I'm convinced he'll have an aorta anyresume before his appointment in two months, that he's doomed, that maybe I have it too my arms are a little long, I'm stalking his family members FBS and Instagrams looking for signs of it, or ways to prove he doesn't have it, ""See! His cousin always has crowded teeth, and therefore ext ext."" But nothing that rules in the favor of him not having it comforts me and every little sign he does it killing my soul. Noticing stretch marks while giving him a backrub? That's definitely not because he had a growth spurt, and also used to be very overweight, CLEARLY IT'S MARFANS AND AN AORTA ANYRESUME IS IMPENDING. 

I posted in a marfans group and they're all telling me to calm down, but Dr. google is whispering ""aorta anyresume"" and ""patients diagnosed early have the best prognosis, uh oh two months is sooooo far what could happen between then and now?"" ""Here's a story of someone who didn't get diagnosed, and whoops they DIED, if only they had been more cautious!""

I'm losing my appetite, and I'm afraid I'm going to drive everyone away with this behavior. Death consumes me. Even if they told me he'll live to seventy I'll be thinking, ""oh my god I will live out my retirement alone I can't handle this."" Dr. Google is consuming me, now I'm worried my dad and aunt have it too and my friend's boyfriend. I'm worrying over every skinny tell person I know and spiraling into my lifelong phobia of anyresumes.

Terrified of My Second Vaccine Dose Tomorrow [TW: Nausea],"Sooo, a *huge* part of my anxiety is rooted in the feelings surrounding being nauseas and/or throwing up. Truthfully, I don’t mind throwing up at all. I actually get an endorphin rush (like a runner’s high) from it- what I can’t stand at all is the nausea leading up to it. 

What’s even worse though is that one of the major symptoms of my anxiety is, you guessed it- nausea. When I had my first anxiety attack last year, it lasted almost three days off-and-on. I would get anxious, feel nauseas, lose my appetite, and when I finally calmed down my stomach would hurt so bad from hunger that it’s freak me out back into anxiety. 

Prior to my anxiety I’d basically just have full-on meltdowns when I was sick with a stomach bug. Panicked walking and talking, crying, almost like a stress-induced temper tantrum but all the anger was just utter despair. I haven’t been sick since my anxiety, but just last week I was constipated and it *almost* sent me spiraling like my first anxiety attack.

Now, I’m getting my second dose of the vaccine tomorrow (Moderna). I’m a 20 year-old male, and before this pandemic I would’ve said I had a fairly good immune system (I haven’t been sick beyond a cold for a few years, knocking on wood). My first shot had basically zero side affects other than fatigue, and as far as I know I’ve never caught COVID prior. 

Today my friend said her friend got the first dose and was fine- when she got the second of the Moderna though she ended up puking her guts out for a whole day and that thought alone has made me so anxious it’s getting hard to even talk about it without my tummy getting mad at me. 

I’m *TERRIFIED* this second dose will make me ill, and all the doctors are saying “Stronger immune systems=stronger reactions”, and “if you had weak side effects the first time then expect stronger ones the second time”, etc. 

So now I have a dilemma; What if I get the shot and throw up? Will my anxiety attack stop this time, or will I be caught in that loop again? Last time I FORCED myself to eat 5 crackers and almost threw them up every bite... it took two hours to eat them. Then I had to force down an actual meal. I can’t do that again, that one incident left me with “after shocks” of anxiety attacks for a whole month. 

Then there’s the alternative- I get no symptoms... but what if I worry SO MUCH about them that I give myself those symptoms? With my first dose I hadn’t even known there were side effects until immediately before getting them, and all I thought was that they were a fever and chills and there was a tiny chance I’d be allergic... just that limited information made my heart rate elevate the rest of the day. 

I’m really wigging out about it now, and I’m starting to flat out consider not even getting the second dose which is completely irrational and stupid but, then again- if I had to choose between staying isolated for another year versus having even 3 days of that anxiety again, I’d choose the isolation in a heart beat. I’d rather get Rapunzled the rest of my life than go through those three stupid days again.",FlynnXa,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4ct3e/terrified_of_my_second_vaccine_dose_tomorrow_tw/

i fucked up.,"i went to a wedding a couple days ago and created one of those cringe memories that you'll think about 20 years from now trying to fall asleep.

i was already shitting bricks upon arrival, but after this i was almost in tears. After I arrived, I was doing my round greeting everyone there. i said hello to my cousin, and then went over to say hello to his girlfriend (whom ive only met a couple times). When I approached her, I was only expecting to say hello and then move on to the next person.. however, i got caught off guard. I said hello, she said hello, then she asked me a question to start a conversation. Oh fuck. my mind was racing trying to keep up some small talk, and eventually i just went into panic mode, turned, and walked away. I felt so embarrassed the whole rest of the wedding and tried to avoid her as much as possible. Even now i still cringe about it..

The worst part about this incident (and anxiety generally) is that I don't have any negative feelings toward her, yet she probably thinks i do from the way I acted. That or she just saw how pathetic I am socially.

I wish it was as easy for me to socialize as other people. As it stands, Im so socially anxious around those I don't know that it's going to ruin my fucking life.

Sudden gasp of air/heart palpitations when on the cusp of falling alseep,"Every now and again, just as I'm literally falling asleep, I get this sudden gasp I air and what feels like a rush of adrenaline. It can be quite frightening but passes quickly.

It honestly happens once in a blue moon. I don't think I have any other symptoms.

I'm not generally breathless, in pain to walk, have swollen feet etc), or, it could be stress/anxiety. Now that sounds more like me.

23 year old waking up after 6 hours of sleep Feel anxious and heart pulsing in my head when waking up," Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. I'll try to be quick and not waste anyone's time. I'm 23 and have been suffering from waking up too early since I was 15. I used to get a great nine hours of sleep every night and never worried about sleeping problems but then all of a sudden I started waking up at the same time my mom would get up at 4:45 AM and I would be going to bed around 9:30 PM. I thought this was strange and it would pass but it kept occurring every night and I would feel so like anxious in the morning and I wouldn't be able to fall back asleep. Then, I would start waking up feeling this pulsing sensation from my heart in my head and I feel my pulse whenever now. Fast forward from 15 to 23 and I'm still dealing with waking up early. I only get around 6 to 7 hours a sleep night if I'm lucky. I have no real medical problems. I've had my blood drawn and gotten a lot of tests and nothing has come up positive except for a cortisol level that was very low once. Here are some of the medications and supplements I've been on

* Melatonin
* Vitamin D3
* Ashwaghanda
* Benadryl
* Klonopin
* Trazodone
* Serqouil
* Mirtazapine
* Buspirone
* Flexeril
* Lunesta
* Vicodin

It's like every day no matter what I'll wake up after 6-7 hours and I'll feel very groggy with this crusty feeling in my eyes but I'll almost feel wide awake at the same time with the way my heart is pounding and my thoughts are going. I'm constantly doing therapy, yoga, weightlifting and everything else. I'm active and have tried so much to fix this problem. I feel like my quality of life has been truly degraded and that my life has been affected so negatively by all of this. The only time I ever gotten sold sleep from all of this was a couple nights when I was taking vicodin and I was prescribed it for my herniated disc. Thank you for taking the time to read this. It honestly has made me so depressed and anxious when I should be enjoying the best years of my life. Please let me know if you have any advice or questions. I've gone to so many doctors that haven't resulted in any help and I kind of feel like I'm running out of hope and life.",Logical_Landscape,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4flp8/23_year_old_waking_up_after_6_hours_of_sleep_feel/

My Expirience W Harm OCD (story),"-Warning might be triggering to some. Talking about violent and serious topics- 
        Not gonna sugar coat my experiences w OCD bc that’s dumb.     

So I have diagnosed OCD, and rn I’m gonna be specifically talking about Harm OCD. Which is basically violent intrusive thoughts/fears of either hurting yourself/others, or others getting hurt, suicide etc... simply making this to spread awareness of how this type of ocd can get and hopefully make others w it; feel not alone:) (((((REMEMBER EVERYBODY’S EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT. this is just MY experience.))))feel free to share stories, it interests me a lot how weird the brain can be. 
One example of having one of these intrusive thoughts,  which happened to me was

When I was sitting down around midnight. My family was all asleep but I heard something make a “thud” noise in the distance. So immediately I thought my mother had hung herself. I almost jumped off the couch to go check downstairs (where she was sleeping) but I tried to sit back. I remember just telling myself it was a stupid thought and it wasn’t real but I then had another intrusive thought telling me if I didn’t go NOW then it would be too late to save her when I make it downstairs and that it was all gonna be my fault. So of course I ran downstairs and carefully opened the door, preparing myself to see my moms body hanging. But I was extremely relieved once i saw her sleeping- but I had to check whether she was breathing or not. Afterwards my anxiety finally went away and I went back upstairs. 

 ••Anyways that’s an example of a violent intrusive thought from OCD which happened to me. (Harm OCD) I’m pretty sure it’s called harm ocd? But yeah! This happens to me a lot, I’ll be posting stuff like this often (overall ocd - not just Harm OCD).  
Also I’m not trying to make you think this is a completely normal way to think. This isn’t something you should or can ignore. Obviously it causes intense anxiety and I hope all of you find therapy and/or solutions that help you:) My page and comment is simply a place for those w OCD to rant and discuss issues/experiences.••",muxeen,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4f927/my_expirience_w_harm_ocd_story/

Work Anxiety Is Debilitating,"I hate my job. I've lived with chronic anxiety and the last three years I've worked here it's gotten significantly worse. I have no support, no respect, and now my depression has come back. 

My background is in communication and marketing. I wear so many hats now, from marketing to accounting to IT support to HR. My battle the last few months is trying to learn a new system from scratch, including the portions I know very little to nothing about - accounting and project management. I've problem solved and built it up as best as I can with no help and am constantly just getting more on my plate. Today my bosses came down asking about if the accounting is in order and all set and to date. They don't give me access to anything. I can't get into QuickBooks outside of what they give me, bank statements outside of what they give me, all of which is usually paper copies and only half of what I need. 

I'm literally so anxious that a simple question just makes me want to cry. They add another task to my pile and I just freeze, feeling overwhelmed and like I've already failed. I hate it here. I sit at home after work thinking of all the things I didn't accomplish in the day and what I have to accomplish the next day. The clock turns and the end of the day is near and I feel my body tensing and the anxiety about work starts to set in again, when I barely just got it to leave. I'm so anxious and I have so many things to do but it's the time in the day where I've hit a roadblock from getting overwhelmed and trying to do too many things at once. I give it an hour before I get the courage to settle in and take another stab at the important stuff. 

Fucking Mondays.

my anxiety has anxiety,"My anxiety has gotten so bad over the years at this point I keep avoiding any and all messages, emails, responsibilities even the ones I want to respond to. They keep piling up and I just can't seem to get to them. I'm so depressed too that I don't even have the energy to respond to people anymore. In fact, even people who I somehow reached out to. I can't even respond to them and I keep hating myself and bashing myself for that because I feel terrible but I just can't bring myself to do it. I've had migraines sinus and stomach issues for years because of anxiety but it's gotten so bad now that I can't even study because of the emotional and physical pain. These past few days I've been having panic attack after panic attack, hourly. Sometimes I start crying without any reason, I'm panicking all the time. And because I'm always anxious and depressed, it makes me even more anxious. Even reaching out at this point makes me so anxious. Venting here seems like a last resort, just to try to get it out at least. My heart rate is so irregular and I feel weak and dizzy. I can't even eat right anymore ever since I stopped eating proper food a month ago. Even the food I do manage to eat I try to vomit it out of my system. And the anxiety doesn't help with the nausea. I know I'm anxious because of a million things happening in my life right now but fucking hell I just want a few minutes of peace when I can breathe normally and think normally.

Anxiety and enhanced awareness of judgement and ego when on marijuana,"I have been smoking for about 2 years now (17 male), and I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, which I take meds for. When I first started smoking, before I was on my meds, I would get crazy panic attacks and feel like I was unable to breathe. Now that is fine, but something much worse happens when I get high now. I will seem to focus on things very much and completely break them down and judge them, until I point out all the flaws and phoniness in them. I especially do this to myself and the things I say when I am around other people, trying to have a conversation. I really like certain aspects of being high, but I can only now enjoy it when I am smoking alone in the middle of the night, listening to music or watching like one TV show, because everything else seems phony to me and I can't watch it.

Itchy and burning skin,"I've had social and GAD since my teen years (likely misdiagnosed in my childhood). This past winter (since November 2020), I've experienced servely itchy and burning skin on my legs and arms. I did a some research and tried all the suggested remedies - humidifier, moisturising, cold showers, moisturising and non-stripping body wash. Nothing helped.  My skin isn't constantly itchy and burning. It used to happen only after showering, but I noticed the itch and burn happening at various times throughout the day/night. 

It's now early May, and my skin still itches and burns. 
I scratch to the point of severely bruising my skin. I thought maybe once winter is over this would all improve. Now I'm starting to think it's related to my anxiety.

That being said my anxiety has seriously affected my comprehension skills( trouble understanding verbal instructions is basically what I’m trying to say). I sometimes tell the people that are explaining things to me that I understand what there trying to tell me when really I don’t. I do this because I fear that people will think I’m stupid for asking twice or even asking a third time in repeating what they said.

I also plan on getting a job in a tire shop in the meanwhile but again the thought of me working on peoples car and realizing that I could seriously hurt someone by forgetting to tighten a lug nut for example scares me to death and stops me from even trying to apply.

This is a list of steps my therapist sent me that I have saved in the notes on my phone. They may help you and I hope they do....,"

Here are your steps. I PROMISE that if you practice these steps, you will feel better. However, anxiety only waxes and wanes over the life course, it doesn’t go away.

1: STOP. 
Remember, this is anxiety which means disordered thinking, and I must stop my thoughts and physical symptoms.

2: BREATHE:
Focus on your breathing. Oxygen to your brain tells the limbic system you are not under assault. Breath like a baby does. Be sure to breathe and allow your stomach to rise and fall. This is truly breathing through your diaphragm, which is essential to breathing to minimize your anxiety.

3: RELAX
When you are experiencing anxiety, pay attention to your body. Where do you feel it? Focus on relaxing shoulders, etc. wherever you feel it. 

4: THINK: 
I am okay. I need to change my thoughts. There is no threat in this moment. In this moment, I am powerless over my worry. In this moment, I can direct my focus to my environment. What’s the temp, how do my clothes feel, I will breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds, or anything that brings your thoughts into THIS moment. You must get yourself to believe that everything really is going to be ok. This is your anxiety. 

These steps will often  have to be repeated over and over within minutes until you gain control. Practice will make perfect.",throwaway835264,1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4d45h/this_is_a_list_of_steps_my_therapist_sent_me_that/

I can’t even think straight anymore,"I just turned 20 a couple days ago. I had a panic attack the night before thinking that something really bad was going to happen. My birthday turned out to be the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. The next day I became anxious and I felt a depressive episode coming. My anxiety can be described as overanalyzing absolutely everything in the past, present, and future. It’s hard for me to keep up with conversations because my mind won’t stop racing and I’m too busy analyzing I miss what someone said and then start worrying about that. I’m having so much anxiety just putting this into words because I’m worried no one will understand it. Just sending a text message puts me at a stand still and I’ve decided to stay in my room and not do anything to avoid anything that can be overanalyzed. I’m so drained because I just need a break. I can’t sleep and this is the first time I’ve thought about hurting myself. My anxiety is so bad that my fear of dying and pain is the only thing keeping me alive. I feel like I’m at the lowest point and I don’t know what to do.

How crazy would it be if I quit my masters that I’ve been doing for 2+ years?,"I started a masters degree two and a half years ago and to be honest, I hated it from the start. I didn’t have the guts to quit and kept going. At some point it seemed like I had invested too much time to quit.

My anxiety has gotten increasingly worse the past two years. To the point where I can’t function normally and I even have suicidal ideations.

How crazy would it be to just quit after more than two years? Technically, this is my last semester (though I have quite a lot of work left and haven’t been able to be productive at all).

I can't pretend anymore,"Today I was meeting up with friends for a walk. We were just getting started when I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me but I tried to ignore it, as I always do, because it's not the first time it's happened during our walks. As we were going the feeling was only becoming more unbearable and hard to hide. I had started to think of possible excuses so I could go home and calm down.

Unfortunately the feeling transitioned into a panic attack. Before, I used to have a few panic attacks a day, and of course it was a living hell but I was better at managing and hiding them. I told my friends I was taking some medication bc I got an allergic reaction recently and that it had side effects which made me dizzy and made my head spin. My mind was full of 'run, run, run'. But my friends being concerned about me insisted on staying by my side until I got home. I tried to tell them that I'd be fine and they could just continue their walk but they kept going along with me. I was walking a bit faster than them because I wanted to be home quickly and then I couldn't help myself anymore and started to run away. I didn't know what to do afterwards, I felt a bit better because I was alone and 'ran away from the danger' but I couldn't face them anymore, so I went home. I have no idea what they must be thinking. I kind of feel like my body betrayed me in hopes of getting some help. Of course, after I got home I messaged them to say sorry. 

I wish I was strong enough to tell them the truth. I'm afraid because every time I've told anyone they either didn't believe me or ignored it, so I told myself I had to deal with it on my own. But recently it's getting harder to shut up. I hope they don't hate me.

I know I should just tell them but I really can't bring myself to do it, no matter how many times I'd try. In my country, mental health is still a very taboo topic so it makes it even harder. I'll try looking for help from a psychiatrist but I'm not able to do it atm. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't make any sense. 

TLDR: I got a panic attack after not having them for a long time, while on a walk with friends. Couldn't manage it so I run away. I hope they don't hate me.",myrkvrix,2,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n47zbr/i_cant_pretend_anymore/

Wondering if this triggered my panic/anxiety disorder,"In the last year I’ve suffered from higher than normal anxiety due to environmental factors. I was doing very fine in life until I recently bought a house for my wife, child and myself. I’m used to moving from house to house renting and moving after the lease is up, so this being my permanent residence has altered my perspective on life q tad bit in concerns of safety.

Well in the last year I’ve received 2 death threats from 2 separate people, for 2 personal separate reasons. One guy was upset his baby’s mother was in my inbox trying to “flirt” with me, and the other was from an old drug dealer friend who lashed out after a petty argument. 

These 2 events threw me in a constant state of worry. All day. 24/7. Knowing that I work 12 hours a day and my wife and child are at home, my levels of anxiety have been shot up so high because the worry of threats in the last year.

3 months ago, while stoned, I had a panic attack. Not understanding why or how, I had a full blown panic attack. Absolutely nothing triggered it. I’m now starting to understand that my nervous system must be sensitive and on high alert, which is probably why I had one. I quit smoking, but the panic attacks still come every other week. After my last panic attack I believe it triggered a major anxiety issue, where now every second of the day I’m constantly in fear or worrying over my own thoughts. These thoughts consist of “am I going crazy? Am I psychotic? What if my brain is broken? What’s wrong with me?” On loop every single day, further intensifying the feeling of anxiety and worry to the point where I can’t think about anything else.  I can’t eat, I barely want to get out of bed, and I’m kind of terrified of everything now. 

After finally being able to deconstruct these layers of anxiety inside of me, I’m curious, to those who are experienced in this field in any way, is this normal? And which way should I go about healing myself?",cyphes1,3,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n44l0t/wondering_if_this_triggered_my_panicanxiety/

Anxiety before work - any tips?,"Hi everyone,

So, I really hate my job. I'm currently looking for another one (but as you can imagine, it's taking a while with the whole pandemic business).

I recently changed role in my organisation, which has made things a little better, but unfortunately I still have to deal with some old things from my previous role. I can't emphasise how much I hated this job, I was off sick for about 3 weeks last year because my anxiety got so bad, I was even having panic attacks.

Anyway, so every time I take a day any time off work or the Sunday, I am basically up until 3 am. I get overwhelming anxiety about work. I don't even know why I get so anxious, I just feel like something terrible is going to happen (even though when I start it's *usually* fine).

Has anyone got tips for this?

Buspar giving me anxiety at night?,"Hi. I’ve been dealing with an intense amount of anxiety and was prescribed Busprione at 7.5mg 2 times a day. I take one in the morning and one at night.

But like clockwork and taking the buspar at around 10ish at night, my anxiety starts about 2 hrs later and I cannot sleep or shake it whatsoever until I’m forced to take an Ativan.

I feel like my treatment dismisses my main issue (Attention),"So, I'm \[24M\] currently on treatment of what's possibly a Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but my main issues right now are related to attention, memory and issues waking up. I've been struggling with these issues since I was a teenager, and they've became increasingly worse, now (during the pandemic) getting even worse. I started therapy almost a year and a half ago, and a year ago I've began treating my anxiety with medication. At first, I've began taking 75mg Venlafaxine, which really helped with my mood and overall somatic symptoms, but did nothing to my focus issues. Raising to 150mg made no difference at all, so my psychiatrist prescribed 150mg Bupropion along with 75 mg Venlafaxine. At day one i've felt really different, almost like I was cured, but then I've felt absolutely no difference. Increasing it to 300mg also didn't make a difference, only made it worse. So now I've been almost two weeks on 10mg Escitalopram and 37,5mg Venlafaxine (to stop taking it after a month). 

I know these medications take time, but I feel sometimes like nothing is changing and I'm lost in an indeffinite cycle of being completely inattentive and being unable to finish  (or even begin) the majority of my tasks (related to work, college or even everyday life), or even to focus on the present moment while I'm with people I like or doing things I enjoy. I've done a Neuropsychological evaluation and the neurpsychologist concluded I don't have ADHD, but sometimes i can't help but think that it might be my diagnosis and I've been misdiagnosed. I'm not sure what exactly I'm saying here, I'm just really tired of everything, and every change I make in my life (from autocompassion, to meditation etc) changing almost nothing on how much I fail to function in a normal way. I can't stand not being able to work properly, or focusing on the things I'm doing. And I also feel like anxiety treatment doesn't really focus on attention issues. And my therapist (a psychanalist) thinks I'm too focused on getting a diagnosis, and also really focuses on the psychological aspects of my disorder, while I think I should also explore the cognitive and neurological aspects of it. Maybe I have an issue that I'm not treating at all and my life won't stop 'till I get that information, it just keeps going.",vitortensai,2,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n47k7p/i_feel_like_my_treatment_dismisses_my_main_issue/
Is it bad of me to cancel an appointment due to anxiety,"I have a dentist appointment on Thursday but I’ve been thinking about it non stop for the past few weeks and all it does it make me sick and set my heart racing. 

I’m on the way to fixing my anxiety, I’ve started with a counsellor but my anxiety is so horrendous at the moment that I can barely go anywhere populated. Taking the dog out is fine, going by myself to the shops for food is fine if I’m quick.

Feeling like I’m going to pass out
Feeling like I’m going to shit myself
Feeling sick
Dissociating

Anxiety headaches,"Hi friends! 

About 2.5 months ago I developed an unremitting tension headache.. I’ve been given every test under the sun (mri, cat scan, lumbar puncture) and have given every pain killer (morphine, naproxen sodium etc). The headaches are so debilitating I am currently on a medical leave from work. 

After seeing a headache specialist he decided they were chronic tension headaches or chronic migraine (I definitely know they’re not the latter).  He put me on topamax to see if it will bring any relief. 

I MADE A HUGE break through the other day - I took a chlonazapam and my headache subsided EXPONENTIALLY. I thought it was a coincidence so I tried again the next day and aha - subsided again. So it appears these headaches are severe anxiety/ tension headaches.

Everything feels “wrong”,"Does anybody find that when your anxiety is flared up, things just feel like they’re kind of “wrong”. 

I think it falls into the category of impending doom, be it that the doom is either impending, or currently happening.

It definitely holds me back from things I’d normally enjoy because they don’t feel like they do normally.

New to anxiety..,"Hello all,

Going back about a month ago I had my first panic attack. It ended with me in the hospital with tingling, slurred words and clenched hands. I was told I hyperventilated. I was running on maybe 3-4 hours a sleep a night and slightly abusing adderal. It was hands down the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Fast forward to present day, I just don’t feel the same; one day I’m perfectly fine and the next I feel anxious. I’ve had the fast heart rate and tingles again but I’ve been able to calm myself down. I believe that all along I’ve been trying to cope with this buried anxiety for years through my drinking. I don’t drink everyday, but when I do, I don’t know when to stop. I’m going to take a long break from any alcohol and most certainly not taking adderal again. It seems like the more I think about the anxiety, the more anxious I get. A vicious cycle.

I’ve never been to the doctor for it but I don’t know what else to say to myself anymore to make it all just bearable. The past year and a half, maybe two, have been pretty rough for me in that aspect. 

Yesterday I decided to get a haircut but I forgot all the barbers I like are closed Sundays. 
So this morning I decided I would go after work. 
I called my wife during lunch and let her know id be doing so, of course she says go ahead. 
I went online to check in and I set myself up for 4:45 as I get out at 4:30. 

I pulled up to the place and walk inside. Tell the lady I checked in online and I’d be comfortable waiting. Well, I was for a short period. 

It’s like it just creeps up on me and for no apparent reason. 
I’m looking at the time get shorter and shorter on the little tv showing the wait list and I can’t help but feel like my heart is beating so fast. 
When I have what I consider to be anxiety attacks I often get dry mouth and I feel like I can hear everything. I tried to convince myself just to do it. That if I ended up being overwhelmed I could just lie and say I needed to use the restroom for a way to catch my breath... 
I waited all the way till it said one minute, then I could feel my chest tighten. 
I decided to fake a phone call and walk out before they could call my name and there was no way back...
I feel really stupid and I hate myself for this. It sounds so trivial on the surface. I just wanted a damn haircut. 
They called me on the phone and I just ignored it. I went home to smoke a cigarette and do homework instead.  

So I told myself I would go on a day I was fully comfortable. Texted the wife, told her I was mad at myself. Idk. I just felt like I wanted to tell someone besides her. It just feels like I’m burdening her.",Lito_kun,1,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n49eoh/i_hate_this/
How can I feel less anxious when my girlfriend is alone,"So recently I have been getting really bad anxiety when my girlfriend is out alone doing stuff. We are both independent people and the relationship is great, but when she is out alone I get really anxious that she will get hurt or harassed by someone and I won't be able to help. 

This has recently gotten really bad and she is going to take a trip on the train home. However she is inst the best with directions and trains, so I am getting really anxious that what if she gets lost or kidnapped, etc. I am also at work when she is on her journey so have no chance of being able to help her. I feel like it's some sort of controlling aspect where I want to be in control of everything, but this trait is becoming really taxing on my mood and mental health.

Medication Advice. (UK),"Hey, I've recently started suffering from crippling anxiety. I was unable to work for 2 months and now I'm back on a phased return. I've seen my GP and they haven't been the most helpful and I've also sought out private therapy.

I've been really resistant to medication but I'm wondering if it will help.

My symptoms are nausea, heart palpitations, headaches and lack of sleep. I went to a&amp;e when this started in Feb as I thought I was having a heart attacked. I'm F27 so rather young. I was shocked when they said it was a panic attack because other then getting nervous for things you would consider normal, such as job interviews... Ive never had any issues. 

Talking with my therapist we are going through the trauma of my brother passing when I was young and I don't think its a coincidence the panic attack happened a year to the date of my friends death.

My mind can paint the gloomiest narrative imaginable - but it has no right to,"When experiencing anxiety, I presume a level of scheming that's outright diabolical behind everyone's behavior and I paint the gloomiest possible narratives by connecting dots in my head that have no place being in relation to each other. Recently becoming aware of this fact, I encouraged myself to do the opposite - assume positive intent wherever possible. It worked, but only in that I recognized the futility of either method. 

There is no limit to the negative or positive explanations you can give yourself, meaning the outcome is completely subjective and has no bearing on the reality of the situation. So stop letting your mind spin either narrative. The only solution, however hard this is to achieve, is to stop dwelling on it at all. 

How might this actually play out in life? Well you can start by taking people at face value. Would it be legitimately devastating to place all your trust in someone and then have them turn around and stab you in the back? Without a doubt, but only for so long until one day you can pick yourself up and stand even taller. But to assume the worst of everyone, on the other hand, that's how you sabotage every relationship before it ever even begins. And then when things fall apart, you're only further engrained in your ways. You tell yourself that this is only proof of your right to worry, that you were right about their malintent all along. You will never break the cycle this way. 

So just submit. Just ride the wave and roll with the punches and love when and wherever you can. Weed may help with this.

Advice for long time anxiety sufferer,"Hi all, apologies for the long read ahead...

I've suffered with anxiety in some form for as long as i can remember. The first incident that really set it off was when i was in first school, long story short i injured myself and felt trapped/like i was in a dream and it took a long time for me to calm down. As a direct result after that, i missed a lot of school, and developed a fear of life and going outside which led to me missing a lot of school. I also developed OCD and had a problem with washing my hands and light switches etc, which eventually subsided but took other forms as i grew older.

I spent a lot of my later teenage years and early twenties abusing substances, starting with light drugs and eventually harder ones, but never anything i would class as 'extremely dangerous' (heroin, cocaine, meth, etc) and after a bad experience on cannabis + hallucinogenics and the birth of my first son, i packed those in and turned straight to alcohol, which continued into my mid-twenties.

After that, i stopped hanging out with the friends who were into those things and developed healthier addictions in the form of martial arts/combat sports. This is the happiest point in my life, from the ages of around 26-30. I was heavily into the sports and had very few panic attacks/anxiety issues during that time. I drank very little and no longer abused any substances. I had a great job and was getting promoted frequently in a career i loved, but i was 'alone', i lived with my parents and was unhappy in the relationship department.

Fast forward a bit (age 29 ish) i met the love of my life and current fiancee/partner. She has mental health history of anxiety herself and has and still is receiving medication. I left my old job and got an even better job with more pay in a busier city center, and started working a lot more in order to provide for mine and her children from previous relationships.

Not long after i moved in with her and got this new job, it started to look as though i just couldn't juggle keeping fit in combat sports, working to get more money into the house and everything else going on, so i gave up the gym and training sessions so i could spend more time with the family and working.

About half way through 2019 i developed the shingles, which i've never had before and turns out it was a result of stress. Luckily, i'm extremely good at my job and am capable of doing it remotely, so after discussions with my boss i was allowed to work from home.

Just before COVID hit early 2020, in December of 2019 i was extremely ill with what we now suspect (but didn't know at the time) could have been COVID. It was like the flu, but far worse than i've ever had it. So bad that i had to call an ambulance out as i was being sick and couldn't breathe properly or keep food down. The ambulance workers took my vitals and just advised me to rest and it was nothing more than the flu, but remember this is just before COVID hit the mainstream.

When COVID finally hit and the country locked down, i was put on furlogh, but i had just asked my partner to marry me a few months prior, just had the promotion to manager for the company and we had literally just secured a mortgage for a new house. This is where my mental breakdown happened, and to this day while we don't know what caused it, we suspect it was the combined stress of all three of those. I was put onto valium (which is pretty rare in UK from what i can gather) and Sertraline. My OCD (particularly ROCD) was at it's heights, i kept questioning life and my relationship, whether i was capable of providing and maintaining the house payments and if i truly loved my partner, which killed me because i couldn't understand why i was thinking those thoughts.

Eventually, we moved to the new house while i was still in furlogh and the script for valium ran out. The sertraline helped with my reactions emotionally to the issues i was experiencing, but didn't prevent them at all. I underwent CBT which helped very little, but it was nice to hear someone acknowledging my struggles and confirming them on the GAD9 chart, my generalised anxiety was pretty shocking.

After struggling in the new house remotely working for about a year, i decided to stop taking the Sertraline and wean off of it. because the doctor kept adding 50mg every time i told them it wasn't working. I took matters into my own hands and started vaping CBD flowers, which worked fairly well, better than the SSRIs, but was very expensive (about 100-150 pound a month), and i wish i had stopped there. In order to get a more consistent but cheaper supply, i signed up for legal cannabis in the UK through prescription. This was a bad idea, as i was given CBD + THC oil and this brought back all my issues from a teenager in terms of bad experiences. The one night i took the oil, it felt like i was having the worst panic attack of my life, so i stopped taking the oil and immediately reverted back to SSRIs and Mirtazipine (for insomnia). 

I did switch from Sertraline this time to Prozac which is known to help with OCD better, which is definitely something i still have (intrusive thoughts that bother me, the compulsion to do certain things).

While i was receiving the new treatments, i requested another course of CBT tailored for OCD and also signed myself up on the NHS for an ADHD appointment as from reading into that, it seemed i met a lot of the criteria/symptoms. It was confirmed about 2 weeks ago that i do show signs of ADHD and was put onto Elvanse (lidexamphetamine) but have stopped taking this now as it exacerbates my anxiety.

The long and short of it is that i'm still left with symptoms (brain fog/blank head/confusion/insomnia/panic attack/lack of concentration) and am on a mix of drugs to try and help with those, but am sure that some may even be causing/making some of that worse. I'm actively trying to contact a private psychiatrist as i've been trying to save up money by going the NHS route, but it's proving pointless currently as i've been suffering for a long time.

I'm not here looking for free psychiatrist or professional help, but just advice and perhaps even similar stories if anyone can related. Am i alone? Am i fucked up from the drugs i did when i was younger and just haven't noticed it until now? Am i not cut out for working and providing for a family?

It seems all of this got 10 times worse when i got a successful, well paying job (the stress and mental breakdown).

I know i love my partner, the thought of not being with her kills me, but the thought of staying with her for the rest of our lives while i'm like this and the burden i obviously am is equally as bad.

I'm the sole provider for the family in terms of income, but this actually works better for us as my partner takes care of the kids school runs and most of the household stuff while i work a bit earlier/later to progress. She tries looking for work on the side but the current climate for her skills is a swamp due to COVID lay offs.

My job is great. Yes i do way too much and my CEO is aware of this, he doesn't want me to leave and i'm about to get my third pay rise here and my role migrated from management to a more technical one.

TLDR; Suffered with anxiety all my life from a young age and suspect i've been finding coping mechanisms in the form of substances, fitness etc until now. I bury myself into my work and hyper-focus on things i can control to avoid reality. I used to be really fit and healthy, but am now older and spend most of my days working remotely in bed, not maintaining my health or stress levels appropriately. I suffer with constant brain-fog, low mood and anxiety. Am i fucked?",AnythingEastern3964,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n42qu6/advice_for_long_time_anxiety_sufferer/
Went to an event and wanted to die.,"My roommate and some friends from work invited me to this art showing with lots of people, food, and live music. My roommate kept begging me to come, promising I'd have fun and that i'd be treated like family there because he knows everyone. It should be fun I hoped. 

What a horrible day. No one talked to me, I felt so out of place, and the music was too loud. I could not cope with the situation I was in. I hated being there so much, it was all I could think about, So I stood by myself in a corner. I hated following my friend around like a lost puppy, being dragged from conversation to conversation having no say in any of it because I can't hear them. All the while I can't relax, I 'm not having any fun, and I can't focus on anything. I started having some serious photo-sensitivity mid-way through and I just could not see for 20 min. Eventually 5 hours later, I said fuck this and decided to leave early. And the fucking worst part is when I told some the few people I knew that I was leaving early, everyone is saying I can't leave yet and I look like I'm having fun? Fuck you assholes, only when I want to leave does everyone want to start making me feel welcome. Not only was my anxiety about to rip my chest apart, but now i was anxious and pissed that I was asked to stay longer. So I left and walked 4 miles home because my friend drove and was gonna be there till the very end.

Are these benzos withdrawal symptoms?,"A bit more than two months ago I started medication and my psychiatrist prescribed me Clotiazepam to ease my anxiety while the antidepressant started making effect.

All day I feel some sort of tension, restlessness in my feet, headaches, insomnia, sometimes, tension in my jaw as if I was clenching it very hard. 
I'm confused, I didn't expect this to happen cause I've been taking it for just a few weeks and reducing the dosage very slowly...

"Anxiety is returning again (nsfw stuff, eating disorder like symptoms)","About 4 months ago I had a girlfriend that I really liked.

Need medication but I’m too scared to ask for it in case I gain weight,"I (19 F) have experienced pretty bad anxiety on and off for about 7 years now and I think I’m finally at the breaking point and need help. I’ve never went to the doctors because I’m embarrassed and I also try to convince myself I’m making up my anxiety in my head and that I don’t really need help or even a diagnosis whatsoever because I’m just taking it. My dad also struggles with both anxiety and depression which for some reason makes me feel even more embarrassed and uncomfortable admitting that I might need help. My struggles could never compare to his and I know my parents will think I’m a fake or that they won’t fully grasp that I struggle too.

Anyway what made me start to think about getting help is my job. I managed to get my job back after having lost it because of Covid but only a week in I’m already really struggling to get through a 9 hour shift. The first half is fine, I feel great and productive enough to keep up with my other co workers. But about an hour in to the second half I fall apart. I start thinking that everyone is mad at me or hates me. Whenever a co worker speaks to a manager I think they’re talking about me. I start thinking that there is no way I can keep up with everyone else and about how they’re all miles better than I am at the job. At this point I usually start crying and I work in retail so I have to try and hide my face from the customers while still trying to tidy the shop and deal with all the other stuff I need to get done before close. The thing that really gets to me and makes me upset though is thinking about how they asked me to come back and work for them when other people I worked with before who were miles better than I am weren’t asked to come back. I feel incredibly guilty and like I’m letting them all down. I also fear my boss will fire me for doing such a shitty job because I find it hard tidying everything in a timely manner when my hands won’t stop shaking and I’m struggling to breathe because of my anxiety and my face mask. I get extremely overwhelmed and I haven’t had a panic attack at work yet but it’s scary because I constantly feel for the last few hours that I’m on the verge of having one.

My friend knows about this and she’s worried for me and wants me to get help but I know I’d be given meds because of how off the rails my anxiety is and I’m scared to take them. I really want to avoid gaining weight at all costs and I already only eat a very very limited selection of foods to avoid bloating (I have pretty severe ibs) because I don’t want to look fat. I’m only a U.S.A. size 2/UK size 6 but I’m an hourglass shape with poochy stomach, big bum, thick thighs, etc. So although I’m slim I definitely don’t have the ideal body and could never compete with girls who are straight up and down with a flat tummy. That could never be me because even my bones stick out way too much for that - my rib cage is large and my hip bones are really wide in comparison to my waist. The idea of looking even bigger or curvier than I am already makes me feel sick and panicky. I already have so much anxiety over the way my body looks and I worry that everyone thinks I’m fat because of my legs and hips and tummy. I also feel one of my friends already judges my weight because she always tries to pick out clothes for me that are about two sizes larger than what I actually am, and when I told her about a tank top having straps that were too large that they would fall off my shoulders she said I should try a size or two up. So I really don’t want to be looking any bigger than how I look already :((

Will anxiety medication really make me gain weight? If it does I don’t even want to bother going through the process of asking for help because the idea is incredibly scary and would make me feel vulnerable for the sake of nothing. Are there any particular meds to stay away from for this? And when it comes to medication would I be given it long term? Apparently long term is when you can gain a lot of weight and I really really don’t want that. I’m not kidding when I say I would immediately stop taking the meds if I noticed weight gain even if it was at the expense of my mental health. At that point I wouldn’t care how awful I felt mentally anymore just as long as I could prevent further weight gain. I just hope that I can find medication that makes me feel good again without ruining my body

Anxiety at nighttime and sleeping on stomach,"As stated, my worst anxiety is at nighttime and the only way I can fall asleep is by sleeping on my stomach. Something about having the mattress pressed against my chest is comforting to me and nothing else works. This has caused neck/jaw pain (I also clench jaw in sleep) but it is better than being exhausted. I believe this is related to abandonment and early childhood issues/trauma. I have tried sleeping on my side and I can occasionally but I need to be very closely hugging a pillow in the fetal position, which has caused new muscle tightness issues in my hips/knees.

"I'm quitting my job today, and it feels like a weight is off my shoulders","I've been in telephone-based customer service for a year and a half, and while my workplace is likely the best call center community I've ever seen, we haven't had a chance to experience this since before COVID. Instead it's been working at home and dealing with, in the words of my therapist, ""verbal abuse"" that takes place over the phone when a member is angry. I held out during COVID so I could keep working, but drew the imaginary line in the sand last week when I considered checking into the hospital due to feeling the need to hurt myself (a bad habit, but three years clean), finally reaching the point where I could say ""I'm done"".

I don't yet have another job lined up - the most stressful part of quitting now, but I plan on a strict regimen of waking up early like I'm going into work, all to get applications done and start daily workouts again. 

I have time off saved up to cash in on and provide a cushion while I get my new job. I live with my grandmother to whom I pay fair rent to, and she is reducing rent for two months while everything comes together.

"Be cautious of the victim mindset, be your own hero instead.","First of all I need to say that this subreddit and the increased discussion/acceptance around mental health has been monumental in helping all of us understand this disease. More than that, the realization that the guilt society put on us for so long is ignorant and detrimental to our recovery and success. However, I think in the effort of consolation and support we may have overcorrected.

I (23M) was 19 when i started my battle with mental health, first with depression and soon after anxiety. Nowadays, anxiety is 90% of the battle so here I am. I realized in the first year after my official diagnosis how easy it could be to chock everything up to my A/D (anxiety/depression). In my first panic attack / major breakdown I quit my job, unleashed via on friends, and trashed my room. Toxic. I was incredibly afraid and lost all sense of reality. When I came to I contacted my boss and friend and let them know that Id had a panic attack and more or less blamed my actions on it. The next 6 months were the worst yet as i slipped deeper and deeper into my fears. I stopped socializing, failed my classes, burnt more bridges, and left myself even weaker and more alone. Through all of this I had been telling myself that I was so ill and so mentally weak from my A/D that I couldnt do anything to stop it. 

Finally, I saw a quote which read something like ""Your mental health is not your fault, but it is your responsibility."" It changed everything. I think in the massive online movement to make the discussion around mental health more supportive and open, we have created a culture that can blame any shortcoming on mental health. I dont want this to come across as hyper-critical. I know that support and love is the only gateway to breaking through this together. But sometimes that love needs to be a little tougher. 

Admittedly this responsibility is something that gets easier as I get older, and as Im sure theres a lot of you still young in this sub let me tell you: It Gets Sooooo Much Better. Dont Give Up. But start to pick up that responsibility now and lead yourself into the light. You are your own hero. You are incredible. No one knows you or how to help you better than you. But you cant do it alone.

Support is necessary in this battle, but even more so is finding the right support. Its a huge step for some of us and its the hardest, but working up the courage to tell your parents, your friends, your loved ones what you are going through will be the best thing you ever did. This subreddit is amazing, but shouldnt be your only support. We all need real, in person, human love and understanding. Be cautious of what social media will tell you about your anxiety. You are not a victim to your own mind, you are your own hero. 

TLDR: Anxiety isnt your fault, but it is your responsibility. Be wary of falling victim to your own mindset and form a irl support group to help you. You are your own hero, not your own victim.",cookwithproblems,119,12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3c9zn/be_cautious_of_the_victim_mindset_be_your_own/

Today I successfully went to the gym.,"I have been planning to go to the gym for a very long time. Since last year actually. And today, I went by myself! 

I moved from my home at 8.00am and arrived 15mins later. But I didn't immediately go into the gym. I stayed in the car for about half an hour waiting for I don't know what. I was nervous, you know? I'm going to this gym alone, so I needed some motivation in my head haha. But then, my stomach started to ache and so I went back home for a bit. By 10am, I was still at home thinking about going to the gym. One minute very motivated to go, one minute deciding to cancel. Its a mess inside my head. Suddenly, my brother decided he want to go to the bank so he will send me to the gym. Along the way, I was just thinking what I should do when I reach, what I should say. It was nerve-wrecking. When we reached, he dropped me off and went his way. So now I have no option but to go up to the gym hurhur...  Its not that I'm nervous exercising in a gym, but more about interacting with other humans. Seriously, its like, wherever I go, the receptionist people are always sooo angry? Like their face is just not approachable? That's why I'm always nervous whenever going to somewhere where we have to register like dentist, clinics, post office or wherever.  When I went inside, luckily there were only a few people there (it is 11am on monday so...) Talked with the guy at the counter. Almost cried just by trying to talk to him but luckily I didn't because if I did, you're never gonna see me there again. Anyways, he was very friendly and nice, and he showed around the gym and how to use certain equipments. Had an enjoyable time at the gym. Now Im already home and feeling fresh and grateful to the gym bros there that helped me.

I hope this story can motivate anyone who is anxious going somewhere. Just calm down, take your time and go to your destination. It might not be bad and actually improve your day :)",Sure-Fisherman2473,15,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3ojcb/today_i_successfully_went_to_the_gym/

Is there a word for anxiety about being wrong?,"I have this intense anxiety about being wrong. It's not quite perfectionism, though it may be related to that. It's that if I tell someone something, believing it to be true, only for it to turn out to be false, I spiral into thinking the absolute worst possible thing will happen, like someone will die because of it, or it will ruin someone's life. I have tons of memories of being wrong, almost like the instant I'm wrong about something, it is stuck in my mind forever. 

I wonder if it is almost like OCD? But I am not sure if it is an obsession or compulsion exactly.....just this intense catastrophizing of basic errors, like telling someone a fun fact and finding out it was a myth, or giving someone the wrong directions, and I believe that something horrible will happen because of it. It is especially bad if I should have known it was untrue. 

I have similar anxiety about lying. If I lie, even if it was necessary, or a small lie, or if I didn't mean to lie, I feel disproportionately guilty. I do my best not to lie, but sometimes it is safer to lie about some things.

Even while I am writing this, I am proofreading it and editing it to make sure nothing I say here is false, doublechecking that I'm not misleading myself or remembering things wrong or exaggerating. Maybe that is a compulsion.

I know this is something I need to work on, though honestly I don't know where to start since as much as I try to convince myself someone won't die because of me accidentally giving false information, I physically believe it. Even if I temporarily relax and forget about it, it will bother me again in the future. 

I just need to know if there is a name for this kind of anxiety, or if anyone else experiences this, so I can start to figure out what to do (and hopefully feel a little more normal, if others experience this and I am not the only one).

Also, how do you stop latching onto memories? I have anxiety over using a word wrong on an essay years ago, lying about why I got a class jeopardy question wrong in fourth grade, accidentally lying about something in preschool when I truly did not know how to articulate what I meant. The memories should go away, right? But they don't--and the guilt weighs the same, whether it is ten days ago or ten years ago.

I've found out the mysterious cause of my anxiety,"Nobody can have anxiety out of nowhere. I didn't have a clear cause to my constantly anxious mindset.

Recently I accidentally came across the connection of anxiety to autism spectrum disorder. I looked up the symptoms, and I was shocked - I related to a lot of the symptoms mentioned.

So it turns out I have undiagnosed ASD which is causing my inadequate anxious responses to everything.

Whenever I try to do things that require a lot of mental effort and socializing, I'm crushed by anxiety. I force myself into normal conversations. The only natural urge I get to talk about is my special interest.

Everyday I have to put a mask on. I'm a completely different person behind it. Can't really trust any other way of living, I've become a chameleon that has mastered to act normal to be accepted.

Masturbation and porn was the cause of my severe social anxiety and it might be the cause of YOURS TOO!,"Im new here guys and i came specifically to help those out who sufder from anxiety and still keep masturbating to porn.
  

 Back in 9th grade i was masturbating like a madman and keep in mind i used to be a very confident, athletic and skilled guy, i was just very charismatic!


   I remember my first time releasing my semen and i just felt...empty like yeah i was relaxed and all but it was accompanied with an uncomfortable brain foggy/ empty feeling and it slowed me down alot. I slowly got worse at socializing in social circles and i got terrible at keeping a conversation flowing with females. 


 9th grade was also the year i got my first girlfirend and i thought i had it all until after 8 days, she broke up with me and i was devastated. She broke up with me because she ""wanted space"" which isnt a bad thing at all so after a couple minutes of convincing her to stay thru text i just let her be. A year later my good friend told me that she broke up with me because i was ""acting feminime"" that shattered me.


 She had straight up lied to me about the reason she broke up thinking i would get mad or something. But now when i think back to it, i was truly acting feminime and i Don't blame her nomore like i used to. I was constantly jacking off to porn on a weekly basis and constanlty lying around eating junk food just letting my life and grades slip away. Had this had been in 6th grade i would've lost my virginity to her.


Fast foward to a couple months back i was doing abstinence from beating ma meat and im not kidding i felt true confidence. I approached my crush of 4 years and received a hug from her when school began. Had that had been in 2017 or 18 i wouldve avoided eye contact with her let ALONE a hug.

I've only had one friend who has kept in touch with me over the last year and I do miss hanging out with her. She has been understanding about my wishes to not meeting for over a year.

I don't know how to explain that I just feel extreme anxiety. A few weeks ago I expressed to her that I was so excited to see her soon, but now I just feel awful. I don't feel comfortable yet in social settings and I have gained some weight over the last year. I was already overweight and now I just feel extremely uncomfortable and don't want to be in any social settings til I feel more comfortable with my body... which will take a while.


Just not feeling good today and wanna stay in isolation... like forever.",garysanthropology,14,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3lr7v/feeling_extreme_anxiety_about_social_settings/

it’s hard,"my anxiety has hit really bad again. I feel anxious about anything and everything, i know it’s bad when i lose all of appetite because I eat quite a lot. I have been trying to find a therapist but the place i’m calling hasn’t been picking up and it’s frustrating me because the one time I do try and reach out for help, it doesn’t happen. I don’t know why i’m even feeling anxious, i’m done with school in 2 weeks and i’ve been telling myself to push through but honestly i don’t think school is the problem because I have been doing quite fine this semester. Prior to my anxiety hitting really bad, I would always have my camera on and participate in these zoom classes but now it’s a struggle to even pay attention in class. I sometimes beat myself up for it even though I shouldn’t because I tell myself “all you have to do is sit there, why do you have anxiety?” but then another part of me is like “it’s okay to feel like this, you will be fine.” My mind just feels jumbled at the moment, i want to get back to myself but it’s so hard when anxiety interferes. I want  to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about medication, but I honestly don’t even know how to get to a psychiatrist, it all just feels so hard right now.

Anxious before work or thinking of work,"I have been at my job almost 6yrs come mid august. I’m in tech support from home and in recent past few years my anxiety has risen for some reason. I get anxious the night before and the morning before I’m supposed to go into work. Some of it seems to be fear of the unknown, what may come on the other end of the phone call, hearing from my manager for fear of bad news or something. Fear of losing my job. I’ll at times avoid or delay certain tasks at work. Due to afraid of what the response may be. Such as having to calling someone and giving bad news and afraid may go off or something. Everyone I’ve worked with though has said I do great and very nice and considerate. But that I need to have more confidence in myself. I know I need more confidence and I like the company I work for and would be hard to find another job with the pay and benefits I get from them. I want to grow and move in the company. 

Typically it’s hard getting through the door and started, but once I do and as day goes on typically ends up not being so bad and see it as that wasn’t so bad. Why’d I make it a big deal. But I’ll typically get anxious and sometimes my mind tries to spiral into excuses to try snd call out or maybe stomach gets upset/IBS-D. I also deal with financial stress , depression from having bad back (from wrecks etc) being bigger guy and not lost the weight I want and need too. I also tend to be an over thinker as well. 

Any advice that helps get you through the door to get into to work and stay in and over your anxiety/ overthinking would be appreciated. I have seen multiple doctors, therapist etc. also on some medication as well. But doesn’t seem to help as much as used too at times.",TheeJman,1,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n40eqr/anxious_before_work_or_thinking_of_work/

I get paranoid about alot of things and I don't know if would be considered having anxiety.,"ok I absolutely hate talking to people. I don't mean that in a bad way I just absolutely dread the thought of talking to someone and then they take it the wrong way.
Another thing is being late for school. I break in to a meltdown and then have to ask my parents to drive me to school.
And I always feel people are judging me behind my back. It could just be me being self conscious (as usual). 
I think that's it. Would any of you consider it anxiety or just paranoia.

Hydroxyzine,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here. I have struggled with anxiety since I was 11/12 years old. I have been on lots of different medications for anxiety including Klonapin, Paxil, Cymbalta, etc. I switched over to Zoloft last October and was also prescribed Hydroxzine to help with increased anxiety. I have 25mg pills and I take one in the morning and one at night and more throughout the day if I need it.

I've been having a lot of side effects from both medications but the side effect that's bothering me the most is fatigue. It's not exactly tired in the way that I'm sleepy and need to nap, it's like I have no stamina. It mostly happens when I stand up. I am so fatigued that I cannot stand up for very long without having to sit down.

I told my doctor about this and she said it's probably the Hydroxzine causing this. She told me to try and cut back on it if I could. I guess ideally I will not have to take the Hydroxyzine and will okay just on the Zoloft.

I was wondering if anyone else has taken Hydroxzine and had a side effect like this? I recently found out Hydroxzine is a an antihistamine like Benadryl which makes sense. Hydroxzine has helped a lot with acute anxiety when I increase my Zoloft dose but I am honestly tired of being exhausted.",devioustofu,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3xqel/hydroxyzine/
went to see a new psychiatrist for an ADD diagnosis...came out with a bipolar diagnosis instead???,"so about 2 years ago i started having really terrible panic attacks and anxiety that was interfering with my day to day life and making me miserable so i went to see a psychiatrist. I was prescribed lexapro and xanax and have been taking that ever since. Recently, I’ve been having an insane amount of trouble with school and life in general in regards to my difficulty focusing and concentrating. I’ve been seeing a lot of tik toks about adult women diagnosed with ADHD later in life and everything they were saying was exactly how I felt. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and told her about my symptoms including feeling exhausted all the time. She kept focusing on the tiredness and decided to lower my lexapro dosage thinking it was a side effect. I was really upset because I felt like she didn’t actually listen to what I was saying and focused on something that was annoying but not affecting me as much as the focus and concentration. 
After about a month of lowered Lexapro dosage and not feeling any increase in anxiety, I decided to have a fresh start and see a new psychiatrist. I told him about my history and my new symptoms that were affecting me greatly. He asked if i was impulsive (which I am since I have about 6 tattoos that were all walk ins lol) and if i have anger issues. I do get really irritable a lot where every sound annoys me and everything that people are doing around me annoys me and i’ll snap at people and then feel really bad after. I feel like it’s mostly a sensory overload thing where i just get really overwhelmed by everything around me. I don’t really think it’s an issue and I feel like everyone gets this way. 
After he asks all the questions he tells me i don’t have ADD and he wants me to 1. stop taking the lexapro , 2. stop drinking coffee and 3. start taking lamictal. After i got off the phone with him, i looked up the lamictal and found out it’s a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. so now i’m freaking out because apparently i have bipolar disorder and i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop taking the lexapro because i feel like it really helps my anxiety and i don’t know a lot about lamictal. but i’m also curious to see if the lamictal helps but i still feel like this isn’t going to do much for my difficulty in working. anyways i’m just looking for advice, encouragement, just anything to help me off the cliff lol",surfergirl1523,1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3xq8x/went_to_see_a_new_psychiatrist_for_an_add/

It's been happening more recently, and I keep worrying that I've hurt people I don't know anymore, or that I'm a monster because my memory is completely shot and all I've got to go on are these toxic thoughts that plague me now.

Fever after having a panic attack,Last night I had a pretty bad panic attack. As I was falling asleep I noticed my breathing was slowing down and then I felt a sensation in my neck/face and it set off my panic attack. My anxiety tried convincing me I was having a heart attack because my heart rate kept going from fast to slow pace. My anxiety always claims I’m having a heart attack or stroke during a panic attack so that’s not new. Although it was trying to make it seems different this time. I managed to mostly calm down but my body has been so hot since then. That never happens after I have a panic attack. I don’t know if it’s due to not sleeping too well the past couple days and I just feel like crap now or what. My temperature ranges from 99.4 - 99.7 degrees which is not normal at all for me.

My Journey - What Helped,"Hi All, I just wanted to share my story over the last few months. This sub has been a great help, and I thought my story might be helpful to some of you.

In December my partner had an unusual health issue which triggered the worst bout of anxiety I've ever endured. Since then I've had a number of stressful work projects which exacerbated the situation. No acute panic attacks, but overthinking anything and everything all day long - permanent flight or flight mode. Over the last week I've finally started to feel a little better, and for the first time in months I'm confident that I'm on the road to recovery. I'm sure I still have some hard days ahead, but I know that the worst is behind me.

So in order of most to least effective, these are the things I feel have helped me.

_Acceptance and Commitment Therapy_

I'm really a novice at this, and there's a lot I don't understand, but the core concept is to stop resisting anxious thoughts. Suppose I'm worried about a difficult meeting. I might recognise that my thoughts about it are distorted and unhelpful, so the natural response is to simply try to avoid those thoughts. The thing is, the more effort you put into avoiding those thoughts the more forceful and painful they become. The key is to accept, acknowledge, and allow those anxious thoughts. This is really tricky, and requires a much deeper explanation than a reddit post, but I've found this to be super effective.

/r/acceptancecommitment is a little quiet. ""The Happiness Trap"" is a well recommended book (though I haven't read it). I read DARE by David McDonagh which I found to be a good introduction.

Just to be clear, discovering this concept was my big break. It really was the turning point.

_Cognitive Behaviour Therapy_

While we might realise that our thoughts are distorted, CBT really helps you unpack where those thoughts are coming from and find therapies to resolve them. In the example above, if I'm worried about a difficult meeting, I need to unpack exactly *why* I'm worried about it. In my case I discovered that I have ""Imposter Syndrome"" - I'm terrified of being exposed as a fraud, even though I have a wealth of skills and experience in my field. The solution for me was to ""survey"" some of my peers and coleagues by telling them about whatever screw ups, and note their response. Of course, universally they told me about one of their screw ups and when they did I realised that my judgement of them was dramatically more compassionate than my own self assessment.

Again, this is a really complex area that requires a lot more time and thought than I can give you in a reddit post.

/r/CBT is a good resource. ""When Panic Attacks"" by David Burns, and his other books, are often recommended in that sub. I found Burns books and podcasts to be immensely helpful.

_Decaf_

This one was a real surprise. I always thought that the anxiety associated with caffeine meant the jitters you get after your 6th cup for the day. It's not. I've learned that caffeine is responsible for that pervasive feeling of doom I got on a daily basis. I can assure you that this was a very unpleasant discovery. Coffee has been my special friend over many years, always there for me no matter what, it was quite a surprise to realise that it's been knifing me in the back every day.

/r/decaf is a great resource. I will say though, that sub is really fixated on quitting cold turkey, which IMO isn't the right move for most people.

Previously I was drinking 6 shots of regular coffee a day. I've reduced that to 2 shots of regular coffee and 4 shots of decaf. Decaf still has some caffeine so I've probably halved my intake. There's definitely benefits here but be warned - reducing your caffeine intake is harder than it sounds.

_Deep Breathing_

I used to think that ""deep breathing"" meant something like ""take 3 deep breaths when you feel anxious"", but I was wrong.

There's a lot of research suggesting that diaphragmatic breathing for a significant period of time, like 30 minutes a day, significantly reduces stress and anxiety. I'm certainly not an expert on this but apparently the science suggests that deep breathing can stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system to switch you out of permanent low-level fight or flight mode into rest &amp; rejuvenate mode. This reflects my experience.

Additionally, while you're sitting there deep breathing you can do some mindfulness stuff.

_Meds_

This is last on the list because, the medication has been helpful, but less so than the other things.

In the past I've taken a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs at different times, with breaks of up to a year in between.

This time round I decided on Mirtazapine (an atypical antidepressant) in order to avoid the side effects associated with an SSRI or SNRI.

It's hard to measure but I think the meds reduced my anxiety from 10/10 to maybe 6/10. It made the difference between being functional and non-functional, and I'm sure that it made it possible for me to invest the time and effort required in ACT or CBT.",pseudont,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3spla/my_journey_what_helped/

Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had,"I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

The first week was terrible but as it's settling in, my anxiety is disappearing. I had no idea that my anxiety was as bad as it was until it disappeared. Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

But I'm feeling a crushing urge to not be alone right now. Things seem like they are going well and on the up. I reconnected with two old friends this past week. I have a new job I'm starting and I'm excited for. 

The friends I reconnected with, one is more busy than not and I'm not sure where it's leading yet. The other lives two and a half hours away.

"I really want to move to a new city, but my anxiety is telling me otherwise.","I'm a 23F who lives with my parents just outside of San Francisco. I do love it here, but I feel like I've reached a bit of a dead end. I've lived here my whole life, most of my friends have moved away, and I hate my job. I don't believe moving (to Chicago) will solve all my problems, I simply just want to experience a new place and new people. But ... the problem is when I picture moving, I imagine the *ideal* version of myself doing it. The person who can put herself out there, learn the ropes of the city, and find her circle of friends.

The reality is that I'm a shy and anxious person who reeks of insecurity, and who takes a long time to get comfortable with people. I'm terrified that moving to a new place would really just be me going to work and staying isolated in my apartment when I'm off. Plus I'm extremely close with my parents, and the mere thought of the homesickness puts a lump in my throat. Worst of all, what if something happened to one of them while I was gone? I can barely even fathom the idea of that. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner to my anxiety, and I'm working with a therapist to try to take some control back, but I think it's going to be a long time until I get there. I'm just terrified of being the dumb girl who romanticizes the idea of ""starting over and moving to a new city"" only to feel like a lonely and depressed idiot once she's actually there.

Even something as simple as going to the grocery store or the hardware store makes me uneasy.,"I plan out my trips way in advance, to the point where that is all I think about sometimes. I have my list written out. I know what times traffic is low and the store will be fairly empty. But I'll be sitting on my couch before I leave my apartment and I still find myself saying that everything will be alright and that I've gotten groceries before a thousand times. I literally have to psych myself up just to do mundane things. How pathetic. Or for example, I really want to ditch these fake plants I have in my apartment in exchange for some real ones. But I haven't gone to the store because I'm afraid that I'm going to screw up something, or get the wrong plant or soil, or re-pot it wrong in my place. Even though I've done my research and that I'll probably do alright. They're plants and they're resilient; I'm just scared for no reason.

I want to do so many different things, but I end up just waiting out and eventually just giving up before I even do it. There's a park not far from my place that I've been to before that I enjoyed. Why don't I go there more often? Why am I so afraid to just get in the car and do what I want to do? Am I afraid that I'm going to do something wrong? All of this is completely nonsensical. I've never been this petrified to leave; I think Covid zapped all self confidence I had because I've been stuck at home by myself for over a year and just gotten safe and complacent.

Whenever I get stressed, emotional or do something physical ( can be walking ,running, hopping , carrying stuff or as little as just changing bedsheets) , my body immediately heats up/ itches and I can feel thousands of pin and needles crawling under my skin , and the only temporary solution to this is using water(or a water spray in outdoor) to relief it. This has seriously impacted my life and I have no control of it whatsoever, the symptoms can also last from 5minutes to an hour , but usually staying still+water does the job , however this is not a long term solution and i'm not so sure what to do.

I have once visited a dermatologist but my skin looked fine to him ,and the anti-allergic medicine he gave me (Labixten) doesn't really help either. I also had a full body scan an year ago but all my internal organs looked healthy and normal)

Note: it only affects my body partially ( mainly scalps , forehead, under my chin, back of my neck, Upper torso) , the lower part of my body never had these symptoms) . Swimming is also the only physical activity I can do normally.

I was always on an anxious edge before BuSpar pretending to be chill but my heart was never happy, just too depressed to care. Relatively emotionless and addicted to secret distractions. Always ready to not pay attention to what’s in front of me. Always hiding in the bubble I call home. Not hurting anyone. I can’t be that way forever it will eventually kill me.

Unwanted thoughts that make me feel overwhelmed and that my whole world is crashing and burning??,"Hey guys!

I want to do things but I can't seem to make myself on my own,"I've always liked the idea of streaming or uploading youtube videos where I just play games with a group of people. I play some LoL and Minecraft and I'd be happy to try others if I find a group to play with. I'm kind of hopeful since more content creators aren't using face cams, which would make me much more comfortable. I'm slowly trying to work myself up to it like recording short videos to send to my brother but it's pretty slow lol.

I hit a roadblock when I realized something I struggle with. I so badly want more friends and I do my best to talk to people and be open. But I caught myself thinking about how I don't want them to depend on me to come and hang out if I'm having a bad day (which I've had more of lately). Like some days it's difficult for me to talk a lot and that makes most people uncomfortable. I think I'd work best in a fairly big group of friends so I'm not under as much stress to carry a conversation. I also struggle with trusting that people will still like me once they get to know me or 'once they know how messed up I am'. I know this isn't a good way of thinking. I don't know how to get past it, though.

For anyone in the mcyt community, Wilbur Soot said that Tommy helped him a lot by asking him to get in a call and play. I don't have anyone like that and I'm really hoping I can find someone someday. None of my friends play games or ask to play. They just notice that I'm not okay and (from their past experience with me) leave me alone to get over it. I'm not good with emotions so they don't usually know how to help me. A lot of my growing process has had to happen through myself.

I've had a breakthrough recently, though! I asked one of my best friends to room with me in college, so I'm hoping that we'll get closer and I'll also be able to open up more. I've been hopping between a couple of therapists to work on talking about my feelings and trusting people. I think I've gotten a lot better. It's still kind of crushing though to not feel like I have any real friends. Even some of my newer friends at school ask me to come hang out a few times and when they see my reluctance (basically just fear of feeling bad or ruining the mood) they don't want to make me uncomfortable. They stop asking as much. I feel like I'm making a cycle that I can't get out of no matter how much I want to.

How do I find a group of friends? 

This feels so weird to ask. I usually end up being kind of adopted by people so I'm not the best at seeking new people on my own. Plus, them knowing in advance might help but I don't want that to be all they think of me. I have good days and bad but once people find out I have strong anxiety it's all they tend to see.

I failed my treatment plan and I'm scared to go back to the doctor,"A few months ago, I finally decided to go on a mental health plan. The doctor was super sweet. She started me on lexapro and gave me a referral for a psychiatrist. I was really excited. Well I stayed on the lexapro for about 3 weeks and then my shiftwork kept fucking with my schedule so much (on and off nightshifts) and I forgot when I had and hadn't taken it because I suffer from a lot of short term memory loss. And eventually I gave up because I thought it was useless to keep trying. I hadn't even used the referral for therapy because I was so nervous about having to call around clinics as many are booked out for months these days and I was too exhausted from work to bother, anyway.

I switched jobs to something less physically and mentally taxing which at first I thought was helping. I'm on a proper schedule now, too. But my anxiety is just manifesting in different ways. My paranoia has gotten so much worse. I keep second guessing myself and my own intentions, and I feel like my only close friends are plotting against me all the time. I don't believe them even when they tell me everything is OK. I keep playing the 'are my emotions valid and real or am I just overreacting?' game, and internalising everything. And now that I'm not constantly thinking and worrying about work, my ADHD feels worse too and I can't relax or keep myself occupied at home. I can hardly focus on my favourite video games.

I'm so embarassed to try and see the doctor again. This is the second time I will have failed on taking meds in the last couple years. Every time I forget to do a simple task or put something down and misplace it for the billionth time that day I just want to scream. I want to curl up into a ball and cry until I disappear.

"When anxiety is likely the cause of your chronic high heart rate, but then you're freaked out that your heart may not be healthy","I have intense health anxiety, ever since I was a kid, mostly regarding my heart health. I think it's because it's the most prominent symptom of my panic attacks, with palpitations and racing beats. I have been assured that it's normal. 

I've been having some intense anxiety over the past couple of weeks. I got a new job, which I do like but I took a pay cut to get my foot in the door of a major hospital and get out of the toxic situation at my old workplace, which paid me more but it wasn't worth it. Because of said pay cut, it's been harder for me to have enough money to make any sort of significant dent ent in my credit card debt, even following the Ramsey model. 

I'm struggling with being able to focus and finish my online medical coding course, which has a deadline to finish by the end of June or I need to pay for an extension. I'm trying really hard to finish soon because this job pays a LOT when I'm certified.

On top of this, there's a MAJOR battle with my new insurance company over one of my medications that I use to treat a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy, but rarer. The med is $17k cash price a *month*, and my new insurance took its sweet time only to deny it two weeks later being like ummm you haven't seen your doctor in over a year, go see him and MAYBE we'll reconsider. Like my diagnosis hasn't changed, assholes, but thanks. So the thought of my med still being denied after I see my doctor freaks me out, because I cannot function without it at *all*. 

So of course now with my heart rate being as high as it has been, and now working in a position where I am regularly reviewing medical records of patients where it is rather detailed with their issues regarding high blood pressure and tachycardia, I'm getting more freaked out. I'm only 27 and the thought of potentially having to take blood pressure meds freaks me out even more. 

Ironically though I did just take a propranolol about 20 minutes ago and I'm waiting for it to kick in, so my body can calm tf down. God I hate this. Situational anxiety is so hard to treat. I definitely need to go back and see a psychologist, because I feel like I'm trapped in survival mode again.",DumpsterPuff,12,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3fi8i/when_anxiety_is_likely_the_cause_of_your_chronic/
Everything is piling up and getting constantly worse,"With the school year coming to a close, my work load is piling up. I have finals, final papers, and an insane amount of homework. I need to study to try and save my grade in one class, but the final is so overwhelming I can’t find motivation to study for it. 

To top this all off, my cat spilled water on my computer last night and now I need to try and get it fixed before my first final on Wednesday. 

This semester has made me beyond anxious, to the point that my panic attacks have come more frequent and worse. I have as needed medication, but because it makes me tired and zone out I can’t take it during days/nights that I have school work to do. 

I know this is only temporary and the weight of school will go way down at the end of two weeks. Yet every day feels like a million years long but also like I don’t have enough time to do everything.

Every week I try and take one night to myself, but that temporary boost barely lasts through the weekend. I’m trying to get better and control everything but I can’t help but worry for the overarching issues that are going on with my school work and busy schedule. I just hope that once I finally crawl through the end of this semester that I will be able to get back on track.

The only thing keeping me afloat is that I know all of this won’t matter in the grand scheme of things and will be more to my life than school. I will only have 2 years left (senior year then graduate year) but that feels light years away. I look to the things that make me happiest, but then day dream and can’t focus on the roots of my problems. I just can’t wait to be at a lake in the north woods, tea in one hand and maybe a book the other, listening to the loons in the morning. That sounds like paradise, but also so out of reach.

This is why I avoid talking to people, destroy any relationship I touch. 




I’m freaking adding fuel to the fire, what am I saying?! Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.




I must archive. I need to delete myself asap.




That’s it. I did it. She went to ‘sleep’. Did she actually go to sleep? What if she just wanted to escape from the hella dry conversation? I can’t take this. She probably disowned me. Does she even consider me a friend? I’m done man. I’m done.




This happened over the course of an hour. The snow globe is a reference to a poem I wrote that described my friendships as fragile pieces of glass that I kept on a shelf. If I messed with it it would be destroyed. Some glasses had more cracks than others. So I’d just leave them alone on the shelf, keeping them safe, but not interfering in an attempt to preserve them.",Tree-Nui-Tee,2,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3ozao/i_typed_out_my_anxiety_attack_and_thought_i/

Fear of Unknown Person,"Everytime I go to my Grandma's old house (she's still alive, but in assisted living), I have such an irrational fear of someone being there. I don't know why but I'm always glancing around corners, scared to go in the basement, and terrified when I hear any noise. I'm always looking back scared someone is going to be behind me or someone has snuck in during the days/weeks period I haven't been to the house. It being nighttime greatly amplifies this feeling and sleeping there alone at night is incredibly tough. I hate not just being able to relax and constantly thinking about this fear when I'm there. I don't know how to really get over this irrational fear. Any tips?",PanamaPhys_,2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n3otg5/fear_of_unknown_person/
