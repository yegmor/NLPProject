###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2319,294,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2319,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 15, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1572389522.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

this is the worst and cruelest fucking catch 22 i've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. what am i supposed to do? the idea of CBT pisses me off. i know what's wrong with me. i know all the tricks that are supposed to help. i've spent almost every waking hour researching healthy coping mechanisms and neurology and the way mental illness in the brain works and what helps against it, why SSRIs and mood stabilizers work the way they do, watched every ted talk, every prestigious school's lecture about it, i've identified all of my problems and where childhood development might've been a factor in causing them, i've done _everything i could possibly think of._

and nothing.

but i'm still trying. and trying and fighting. and trying harder. and fOrCinG mYsElf. is forcing myself supposed to make me worse? because it makes me worse.

i can't fucking win. no matter what i do. i've done so much research. i've done so much reflecting. so much journaling. typed up a seven page document describing my problems and their roots in detail. why can i do that but i can't do something as simple as take showers, meditate, break tasks down into their simplest components, practice mindfulness, exercise, go on walks, eat healthily, drink enough water, get enough vitamin D, get enough B12, surround myself with good people who provide a strong support system, talk transparently and openly about my struggles with people, come up with a routine and a schedule, plan for the day ahead, I KNOW. i fucking know what i need to do. the problem is i can't DO IT. THAT'S WHAT DEPRESSION IS. i can talk about it until i'm blue in the face. but i can't fucking do anything about it.

everything hurts. moving hurts. my body hurts. my brain hurts. it keeps getting worse and i keep letting it because every attempt to pull myself out of this just ends in relapse and burnout. an invisible rubber band pulling me back to square one the harder i fight back. or worse, square zero.

i can't. i can't. i don't know how to get this through to anyone. i can't even get through to my therapist. they keep saying i'm responsible for my own recovery. that i need to follow through with the ""solutions."" that's reasonable, they're right, i know that. but i am physically and mentally UN.

 medication scares me as it is but it's the only other viable scientifically effective option. except it's not even an option for me. if it were an option for me i would know. i keep searching, naively, for solutions. for help. i've reached out already. medication is the last option and it's out of my reach. what's left?

i got scolded by my partner for using alcohol to self medicate last night. it was supposed to be tough love. it made me feel worse, i told him this, and he apologized for it. but i still want to pick up a bottle of wine from the cabinet right now, at 6am, and forget about all of this shit.

,depression,"Hey, so I had some gabapentin from some time ago prescribed by my doc for my depression, social anxiety and psychosomatic pain (or whatever it is). 

Why Gabapentin? Because I have been completely therapy resistant to all the SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI as well as a tricyclic. I‘m also in behavioral therapy right now, just to let you know.

I only took 300mg every morning before breakfast for the last 7 days and well, it was more effective than any other med I tried. My depression was 90% vanished. My cognition (focus, memory, logical thinking) started being functional again. I didn’t feel dumbed out and cognitively retarded anymore. I even felt smart. I especially noticed  my better cognition in social events and conversations a lot but also at reading, following movies and just remembering general knowledge. My head didn‘t feel empty and dysfunctional anymore. My brain was working again.

It did more for my depression than my social anxiety but hell sure the cognitive improvements helped with socializing too. I still felt some kind of nervous before having to socialize but when I was in the social situation I was much more talkative, funny and social. I was enjoying my ability to think clearer, finally being cognitively more functional and definitely feeling some reduced social anxiety.

I know that my dose of 300mg is very low, so I think that a higher dose might not only help my depression and negative thinking but maybe also increase the social anxiety reducing effects.

What I would like to know of you guys:

1. If you have some experience with using Gabapentin for depression and/or social anxiety, what fose have you been on and what effects or changes did you notice regarding depression, negative thinking, mood, energy/motivation and especially social anxiety and sociability/talkativeness/extroversion.

2. Ive only been taking the gabapentin daily for 6 days now as I heard a lot about its withdrawals being hellish and horrible af. What‘s your opinion on this or do you eve have any experiences with withdrawals? How bad are they, how long do they last after how much time on daily gabapentin?

3. Is it possible to use gabapentin occasionally on a only if needed basis? Or is it needed for depression and anxiety disorders to take it daily for better effects and symptom reduction?Like 3-4 days a week only to hinder tolerance and withdrawal. That‘s what I would do it like if possible as I have experience with GABA withdrawals and they are not nice.

,depression,"Hi everyone, I terribly suffer with focus and I'm facing problems in many areas of my life. I feel like I'm slower than other people. 

If people speak to me, it's hard absorbing much of what they say and I usually zone out. I'm even unable to comprehend information while reading any article or a book. I usually have to read a sentence 5-6 times or more for it to stick in this shitty brain only to forget any knowledge my brain accumulated within a day. Lol 

While communicating my mind just freezes mid sentence and all the thoughts just vanish. It's embarrassing given that it happens in a social situation. I'm unable to socialize and enjoy the moment without my mind drifting. Even if it doesn't drift, my mind is totally blank hence I don't have any topic to talk about. 

It honestly sucks being this way and I'm constantly  being self-critical 24/7 judging every word I say and any task that goes wrong at work. I feel worthless with 0 self esteem. 

I don't even feel like working hard or socialising any more because no matter how much I try I'm only bound for failure. Regardless I'm still trying my best to progress in my career but what's the point if you always end up in the same situation? I'm average at best in my work and I'd like to learn more of what I don't know but it's frustrating living with the fact that your brain takes ages to retain information. 

My bosses appreciate me and say that I'm the best employee, even behind my back but what if they say that only to boost my confidence? Probably because they know about my personality. I feel like a fraud at times to be honest and every complement seems fake. 

Lastly, I'm severely depressed all the time and don't have the energy to do anything because of this. Is depression the culprit? IQ? Slow processing speed? ADHD? I don't know. I'm lost and all I'm seeking is guidance. I hope no one suffers like I do.

,depression,"Hello, I’m 23 years Old Male, 4th Year Student. I’m here because I have depressive episodes , paranoia and social anxiety for years now and I just can’t break the cycle of wasting my life. 

No I’m not a suicidal, drunkard, smoker, drug, gaming or even a sex addict. What I’m trying to say is there are days where I literally stop doing anything for a day or a couple of days and do nothing except play games or read stories to escape reality(during  my worsts it lasted for a year or months but this hasn’t happened for the past 3 years). I should have graduated 3-4 years ago if not for my condition. I even  developed improper posture, extreme muscle imbalance and gait due to inactivity.

During my non-depressive episodes I’m extremely productive, I sing, play guitar, exercise, maybe study or clean the house(I haven’t really studied for years because this triggers my episodes due to stress, mostly attend class or pass all the requirement)

How does pandemic make this worse? I’m stuck in my house with my mother and sister. They STRESS ME OUT, they’re not aware of it and I don’t like them. They’re not abusive or bad, polar opposite of everything I guess? Including personality? I also can’t sing because I don’t want to spread saliva unintentionally (literally unstoppable for anyone singing). They always want to keep everything open cause it’s hot when I want to close doors when singing.

My Anxiety and paranoia involves thinking that everyone is looking at or talking about me, and knows something bad or like a scandal about me(Sometimes I even search).

I was able to do a lot before this pandemic and episodes are becoming more frequent,  now it’s happens either weekly, or half a month where I won’t do anything for a few days.

This is only some of the issues there is much, much, much, much more.

I’m here because I have depressive episodes , paranoia and social anxiety for years now and I just can’t break the cycle of wasting my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I’m not a suicidal, drunkard, smoker, drug, gaming or even a sex addict. What I’m trying to say is there are days where I literally stop doing anything for a day or a couple of days and do nothing except play games or read stories to escape reality(during  my worsts it lasted for a year or months but this hasn’t happened for the past 3 years). I should have graduated 3-4 years ago if not for my condition. I even  developed improper posture, extreme muscle imbalance and gait due to inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my non-depressive episodes I’m extremely productive, I sing, play guitar, exercise, maybe study or clean the house(I haven’t really studied for years because this triggers my episodes due to stress, mostly attend class or pass all the requirement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does pandemic make this worse? I’m stuck in my house with my mother and sister. They STRESS ME OUT, they’re not aware of it and I don’t like them. They’re not abusive or bad, polar opposite of everything I guess? Including personality? I also can’t sing because I don’t want to spread saliva unintentionally (literally unstoppable for anyone singing). They always want to keep everything open cause it’s hot when I want to close doors when singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Anxiety and paranoia involves thinking that everyone is looking at or talking about me, and knows something bad or like a scandal about me(Sometimes I even search). I know there is none though it’s only in my head but I can’t stop thinking about it, specially in public. The extremely weird thoughts I thankfully got rid already it

I'm done making feeble attempts to change what is clearly just major flaws in my personality that make me a person that I do not like at all.

I have strongly considered killing myself and I have obtained the means to do so, but I will not kill myself at least until my cat dies, as she does depend on me. I also want to wait until both of my parents have passed, so that they don&amp;#39;t have to experience the trauma of losing a child in that way. These are the only people that I beleive the pain that they will feel from my suicide outweighs my own pain from having to continue living this pathetic life as this pathetic person. I do not want to live a full life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short I&amp;#39;m not actively suicidal and I won&amp;#39;t be until these people/animal dies or my situation becomes far more untenable and my timetable moves up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a point where I have no drive and no ambition to do anything besides sleep, try to sleep, drug myself into being able to sleep, and avoid my job. I&amp;#39;m not going to have a social life outside of work. I can&amp;#39;t imagine why anyone would want to spend time with someone like me. I&amp;#39;m too much of a chicken shit coward to try and date women, so I will be alone forever in that regard as well. I&amp;#39;m done crying about this. I&amp;#39;m done making feeble attempts to change what is clearly just major flaws in my personality that make me a person that I do not like at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m literally just waiting for death to come. Either because there are no reasons left to live and I off myself or even better I get lucky and die of an accident or an illness that is outside of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

I live in a society i don\`t want any part of and i am forced to live like this by standards others have made for me long before i was born.  

I am living a lie and every time i wake up i play my part and just keeping up the appearance of a normal man just doing normal things.

I was born in the wrong place and the wrong time wrong species and wrong planet.

Things i have done in the past keeps on haunting me and will not let go even tho i was a child when it happened, i just want to dig my self a hole and end it.

Idk what i feel about writing this openly on reddit, it's personal but i really want to

share it to people because i hate keeping everything to myself.

I'm a 23 year old man, jobless, virgin and depressed.

Sad start, but it's what it is.

Right now i'm stuck in life, i don't know how to get free from this constant fear that i'm feeling torwards basically everything.

I fear what i eat will ruin my looks and health.

I fear everything i say because i might say something wrong.

I fear breathing the air because of particals, dust, chemicals, bacteria so on.

I fear that i might or do look bad.

I fear the pitch of my voice.

I fear my future to much and that i will be a complete failure.

I fear i will die a virgin.

I fear to be in an accident and maybe become handicapped.

I fear death and what it means.

I fear i will loose my friends.

I fear people hate me.

I fear that me and my family will become homeless because our economy suck

and the apartment is in a terrible condition witch the landlord wont like.

I fear i will never be able to play instruments again cause maybe my hands

will get ruined by the constant inflamations i have.

I fear i will never be able to sing because of my tonsils witch doctors

refuse to remove thanks to our laws.

I fear i will loose my hearing for wearing headphones so much.

I fear that i will never get money because of my bad grades or never having a real job.

I fear stress.

I fear i might be stupid or that i'm to  self centered.

I fear that i will look like an idiot for writing this on reddit.

I guilt myself for everything wrong i've done and fear i get judged by people, i've never

done a crime i just feel guilty over stuff i feld i've could have done better or said better.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok you get the point, i fear so many useless things and it's consuming my life to the point where i get no motivation to live life the way i want.

It's getting to the point where i just wonder my self into internet and then i've spended the day

watching Youtube and then when i finally get the motivation to do something i just get into a panic state and escape back into internet again or do something else to escape.

&lt;p&gt;I fear that i will never get money because of my bad grades or never having a real job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear i might be stupid or that i&amp;#39;m to  self centered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that i will look like an idiot for writing this on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guilt myself for everything wrong i&amp;#39;ve done and fear i get judged by people, i&amp;#39;ve never&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;done a crime i just feel guilty over stuff i feld i&amp;#39;ve could have done better or said better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok you get the point, i fear so many useless things and it&amp;#39;s consuming my life to the point where i get no motivation to live life the way i want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s getting to the point where i just wonder my self into internet and then i&amp;#39;ve spended the day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;watching Youtube and then when i finally get the motivation to do something i just get into a panic state and escape back into internet again or do something else to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now i don&amp;#39;t know what to do, what to feel because everything is so overwhelming..&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old guy and I feel bad, really bad.
 I feel like I've never been normal, I see all the people  living their lives and I'm trapped in mine.
 I just want to talk to someone, and I will do it here because in my real life I have no one to do it with.
 I am really tired of my life, and the coronavirus has fucked me up even more.

 As a child I had a fairly normal life, or I was too young to notice if something was wrong.
 Shortly after my eleventh birthday my parents separated, the court entrusted me to my mother, psychologically and verbally very violent towards me, my brother ran away from home the following year and went to live with my father,  he was the only person I ever talked to about my personal stuff, since that time I've never had any real friends or anyone I could talk about what i wanted.
 My mom brainwashed me into believing my dad was a piece of shit, I haven't seen him since I was 14 and i don't see my brother from when im 15.

 In the meantime, my mom found a partner, and she convinced me to let him adopt me and change my surname. I hate him, he's an ignorant, impulsive and rude person.
 Moreover, after a year he fell ill with a degenerative neurological disease, becoming a huge problem for me and my mother.

 And finally my mother, violent and mentally unstable, always takes a lot of pills to treat depression, anxiety etc. and does not seem to be a very lucid person, also showing signs of bipolarism and schizophrenia in my opinion .
 When I say she is violent, I mean violent, very violent, she makes me feel like shit, she screams all day, I wake up with her screaming at me and go to sleep with her screaming.
 she gossip about me with her friends, saying how much I'm a bad son etc.and telling all my personal things, it often embarrasses me in front of other people yelling at me in public.

 All this is not good for my mental health at all, it has made me a very close person, I feel very uncomfortable when I am with other people, even if I don't know them (for example, just sitting on the bus gives me an absurd anxiety) so I avoid going out and lock myself in my room, expecially after covid.
I feel lost and alone, I feel like no one can understand or help me.
I am looking for a job for this summer in order to be busy and maybe work away from home, so I don't have to see them, but despite having sent my resume to a hundred places, I have found nothing.
 If this continues, this summer I would almost certainly run away from home and end up living on the street because I have nowhere to go, and I wouldn't even be able to finish school. I can't go on like this.

,depression,"One of the worst things to happen to me this year. So our house will have a power interruptions every Thursday so we will have to go to our aunt's boyfriend's house. First time I was there it was ok, some few insults here and there we eat on a table then sleep, nothing special. But the second time I was there earlier was hell. 

We stayed at that house for about 1 and a half day much longer than the last time. Somehow being at that house gives more power to my sister to the point where if someone just mentions my name she would slip in an unnecessary insult like ""he's just like that, he (random insult)"" and it happens from time to time and no one gives a shit and if I got mad my aunt would tell me to just calm down and that they were just joking around.

When it was nighttime already I was just about to go to sleep but I heard my aunt's boyfriend say ""so, he's just going to be like that living a boring life"" as if it's his problem and I ended up crying under the sheets. The amount of ""he's really just like that"" insults I got is overwhelming and noone stood up once for me. 

Another bad thing is that my aunt would do something for me and then say that I'm spoiled for not doing it myself, like I didn't even ask you to do something for me so how am I spoiled. And then here comes my sister and my aunt's boyfriend loudly talking about how I'm basically just dead weight without actually saying it ""he's really just like that, he always needs someone to do things for him"" and ""so it's like free service, lucky"" like I said I didn't ask for the ""help"" and I didn't even want it.

The next morning, everyone was still asleep while my aunt woke up early and I wasn't really able to get any sleep and so time passed we got to talk about how I wasn't saying anything and so I found this as a chance to finally say what I want. I told her that I have trouble communicating (I didn't say I have social anxiety, because she obviously know nothing it). I was telling her about their insults at me is not just a joke and that I was actually hurting. My eyes were getting watery just because I was finally able to say it but aunt just disregarded it ""we were just kidding don't get so mad about it, you should start talking if you don't want to get made fun of"" because apparently the people who were making fun of someone isn't the wrong one. I was actually pissed off now, so I told her why do people who are shy always get this type of treatment and her response to me was basically 'woah, that's so deep anyways don't get so mad'.

And so time passed same as usual, I was outside I wasn't allowed to just stay inside the bedroom because ""if everyone is outside then you should be outside too (probably to just attack me and put me out of my comfort zone)"" my sister with the increased amount of insults from time to time the topic turns to me. My aunt's boyfriend with the sarcasm againts me as if he knows me well enough. We were eating and my aunt somehow randomly talked about if I ever get a girlfriend she would be here too (which was absolutely off-topic to the conversation they were having and is an obvious bait for my sister to attack) ""I wonder when the time would come hahahahahaha"" and again time went by as usual.

My aunt told me I should learn to communicate and that if I'm going home I should say ""Thank you, goodbye"" to them because idk. When It was finally my time to leave since my father was outside to pick me up already. I went to the door and my aunt was looking at me. I already know what she wants me to say. I left and I wasn't even able to say ""Thank you, goodbye"" to them I just said a really quiet ""bye"" which made me feel bad and then they repeated my ""bye"" in an upset mocking tone.

I'm not really this quiet and shy around people, only with the people Im uncomfortable and don't get along with which made it worse since I wasn't able to speak up aside from that one time (that got disregarded).

I even made a poll about it before because I don't really know what I should do.

,depression,"
Honestly, I don’t if there’s a real point to this, I’m just trying to write it out and figure my shit out.
I’ve had depression and anxiety since I was in middle school and I finally started getting the help I needed after years of trying to convince my parents that religion wasn’t going to fix it. I’m in therapy and I’m taking medication and I’m trying to make progress but it’s so fucking hard. I didn’t realize how much shit I had bottled up inside until now. I never realized how much the people in my life that claim to love me disrespected me. Growing up, my parents never valued anything I had to say, they were always just so anxious about everything and never had any confidence in me. They constantly hovered over me and just took over anything I wanted to do because “they want to show me and help me how to do it.” They would just disregard all of my feelings and it felt like the only thing that mattered to them were my grades. To them, my grades were a good indicator of how I was doing in all other aspects of my life. I was hitting my head against the wall, crying, and calling myself stupid because I didn’t do well on a pop quiz when I was 7. They didn’t realize how much of a problem this was until I kept getting panic attacks in class and had a breakdown in front of them because I was just worried about my grades in high school. Even after my doctor told them I should be in therapy and possibly medication, they just thought praying in the morning would fix it. 

They constantly told me I was fat and tried to put me on these crazy diets that they themselves never followed since I was 10. Anytime we would go out or even just eat dinner at home, they would just eye the food I got, how much I’ve eaten, tell me how bad everything was for me, and have yelled at me in public over it. They’ve yelled at me for literally eating the same thing as my brother. FYI most of what I ate were vegetables and fucking quinoa but that didn’t matter to them. To this day, I still get uncomfortable eating in public and I’ve just stopped eating in front of them. Any time I actually went to the gym and felt good about myself, they would tell me that I didn’t go for long enough or work hard enough because I wasn’t drenched in sweat. Whenever I asked them why they didn’t do any of the things they yelled at me to do, they would just say that they needed motivation and asked why I wasn’t motivating them to come with them. I’d constantly feel guilty because it felt like I was responsible for their health and any time I fucked up, they would also get sicker idk. 

The only reason they’ve come around and finally started to listen to me was because my brother stopped talking to them once he went to college. But at that point, the damage was already done. My friends didn’t respect and I was constantly the butt of the joke for most of my childhood and my self-esteem was so low I never stood up for myself and didn’t think there was anything wrong with what they were doing. I never put two and two together and figured out why I was always so anxious and sick to my stomach every time they asked me to hang out. They did eventually kind of stop and apologize but I don’t know, I just kind of always felt like the second choice and disposable to them. I felt as though if I opened up to them about how I felt about myself, they would just pity me and I didn’t want that. I’m 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship or even gone out on a date. Even though I’ve had guys like me and pursue me, the minute they show interest in me I panic and try to find a flaw in them.  As I’ve grown up, I have been told I was pretty and funny but idk the thought of someone actually being interested in me romantically is so fucking weird. I literally can’t wrap my mind around it. I used to think that I had a great personality and all I had to do was lose weight until I could actually be attractive but now it’s just the opposite. I kind of feel like a shell of a human being. I feel like my intelligence, humor, and generosity aren’t genuine, they feel superficial and I feel like I’m mimicking someone with those traits, and once people start to get close to me, they’ll realize there’s nothing there but self-loathing. There’s nothing good I can offer someone and the only way I can compensate for that is my body and I can’t do that until I lose weight. The only way I can feel vulnerable and/or desirable is when I’m absolutely shitfaced and have disappointing one night stands that just make me feel even more disgusting.

I’m graduating this weekend and all I can think of was ways I could have been better at school or just smarter. I only focus on my failures. I could have graduated early but I was so depressed and I was terrified I was actually gonna go through with hurting myself and didn’t do well. I know this is a valid thing and I’m trying to show myself more compassion but I just feel like a fuck up all the time. I feel guilty because I know my parents are trying their best and I don’t know if I’m just being really sensitive about everything. I know I should be grateful for the opportunities they gave me and for everything they’ve sacrificed so that I can have a better life and I am but I just feel like I’m spoiled, I’m not doing enough and just taking too much. I am so fucking tired of feeling this way all the time and I know I won’t make it long if I continue to have this thought process but every time I actually think about the issues I feel like I need to work on, I just feel exhausted because they just seem so deep-rooted. I’ve felt this way for so long I can’t really imagine a me that loves and respects herself and I feel like I can’t live my life and go after what I want until I’ve become that person.

They did eventually kind of stop and apologize but I don’t know, I just kind of always felt like the second choice and disposable to them. I felt as though if I opened up to them about how I felt about myself, they would just pity me and I didn’t want that. I’m 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship or even gone out on a date. Even though I’ve had guys like me and pursue me, the minute they show interest in me I panic and try to find a flaw in them.  As I’ve grown up, I have been told I was pretty and funny but idk the thought of someone actually being interested in me romantically is so fucking weird. I literally can’t wrap my mind around it. I used to think that I had a great personality and all I had to do was lose weight until I could actually be attractive but now it’s just the opposite. I kind of feel like a shell of a human being. I feel like my intelligence, humor, and generosity aren’t genuine, they feel superficial and I feel like I’m mimicking someone with those traits, and once people start to get close to me, they’ll realize there’s nothing there but self-loathing. There’s nothing good I can offer someone and the only way I can compensate for that is my body and I can’t do that until I lose weight. The only way I can feel vulnerable and/or desirable is when I’m absolutely shitfaced and have disappointing one night stands that just make me feel even more disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m graduating this weekend and all I can think of was ways I could have been better at school or just smarter. I only focus on my failures. I could have graduated early but I was so depressed and I was terrified I was actually gonna go through with hurting myself and didn’t do well. I know this is a valid thing and I’m trying to show myself more compassion but I just feel like a fuck up all the time. I feel guilty because I know my parents are trying their best and I don’t know if I’m just being really sensitive about everything. I know I should be grateful for the opportunities they gave me and for everything they’ve sacrificed so that I can have a better life and I am but I just feel like I’m spoiled, I’m not doing enough and just taking too much. I am so fucking tired of feeling this way all the time and I know I won’t make it long if I continue to have this thought process but every time I actually think about the issues I feel like I need to work on, I just feel exhausted because they just seem so deep-rooted. I’ve felt this way for so long I can’t really imagine a me that loves and respects herself and I feel like I can’t live my life and go after what I want until I’ve become that person. Idk, if I’m just complaining too much because I do have a good life but I just really needed to write out what I’ve been feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have been struggling the past several months of my life. I am only 19, though life has been changing so quickly for me and I am not very adaptive to changes. 

I have spent the last two years of my life with the plan of getting into nursing school. I achieved an AA in liberal arts and got all of my pre-requisite courses done for the nursing program.  I then took the entrance exam for the nursing program, got a high score, and was instantly accepted into my local Community College's ASN program. I start in 6 days.

The only problem is- I don't know if I want this. I just don't know... I will have to drive and hour both to and from the college. I'll have to wake up at 5 AM just to get to class by 8:00 AM Monday-Friday. Not to mention my mother has already laid down thousands of dollars just to pay for some of my textbooks because she's excited for me. My passions have always lied within art, music, reading, etc... I have always been the creative/caring type of person. I've started making music lately and have found that it brings me so much happiness- but I hate that I discovered the happiness it brings me right before my program is about to begin. I feel like I've ran out of time. 

I also recently had a breakup. It ripped me apart. I still cry about him and think about him every day. I've been feeling so lonely and lost lately- I just wish I had someone here to comfort me. I just want to drop everything and leave the planet. I don't know what to do with the rest of my life on this earth. I am genuinely scared. I'm also sick and tired of all the disappointment I feel. Disappointment from friendships, from relationships, from family.  Every time I believe I have something wonderful- it just falls apart. 

I know, in many ways, life is a beautiful thing. I love to feel love. I love to see the beauty of a simple mountain terrain. I love to see how I can brighten other people's days.

,depression,"I haven't showered in over a month or two, I don't even remember. I think that this year I have showered once or twice so far. I haven't washed my teeth correctly in well over a year or two. Up until a few months ago I had at least been brushing them slightly from time to time just for the surficial looks in the occasional smiling or when speaking, but now a tooth brush hasn't touched my teeth for a long time. Wearing a mask anyway, nobody gets to see them. I haven't shaved for quite a while too. It looks wild but I guess it's not that bad. I just can't bring myself to care enough. I've stopped caring. And I don't know why. Is that normal? Is it a self-defense mechanism?

I am aware that the teeth thing is not good at all for me, but I just... can't bring myself to it. I'm bringing my body down and I can't help it. I just see no point. Neither do I in cleaning or doing household. I'm currently with my parents due to pandemic-related reasons, but if I was living alone I'd probably end up... living in complete chaos and either starve or eat extremely unhealthy snacks, because I wouldn't be able to bring myself to cook. I've also already gained quite some weight recently.

I am ""studying"", which means that I still don't have any clue what to do with my life, but am registered at university in a subject that I absolutely hate and know I don't want to study, but still I'm registered and pretend, for now, until I find a way out of this. I want to study something I'm happy with but I don't know what that could be.

At the moment I am just either at work (part time) or at home, being on the computer all day and playing games or doing whatever I can just for trying to cope with all of this... existential crisis or whatever it is, I don't know what name would fit it. And inbetween, I'm sleeping. Work, sleep, eat, game, wanting this to end, thinking about a way out and finding none, sinking deeper and deeper and deeper... that's my life right now.
Speaking of sleep, my rythm is the opposite of consistent, it shifts all the time... Yesterday I woke up 10 minutes before having to go to work. The day before, I woke up hours earlier than that. I actually wanted to go to sleep at 4:00 but ended up gaming until 8 and then had been looking at my phone until 13:00 (all before sleep). I sometimes look at things on my phone for hours at a time, wasting time... memes or whatever it is... I don't know what I'm even looking for.

And then work again, always, everyday. At least I'm gettinf some money with that. Sleep - proper sleep - is the only time where there's a chance of finding some peace, an attempt of hitting that inner ""restart"" button, if you're lucky and have a good sleep. When your back problems don't prevent you from that. Back problems that you shouldn't have in your early to mid twenties...

I feel like a failure. Life feels terrible, I have no idea what to do in it as a career to live from, and the best I've got so far is my highschool diploma which is essentially nothing. A bad grade on top of that, for reasons very related to the ones you see here. I've lost many years with this ""studying"" and I can't afford to lose any more. And the pandemic makes it all worse. I should be in my student's flat, studying, living an at least okay life, starting to get independent and have an own little household, meeting new people and making new acquaintances and friends, maybe finding someone to date and have a relationship with..... instead, _this_ .....
can't see anyone, time goes by, no end in sight..... isolation and depression. That's it for now.

I'm lonely. Haven't seen my few friends that I have in quite a while. Regarding lovelife, I think you first have to have a life that is not such a mess in order to be able to date someone or lead a proper, healthy relationship or have a chance for it... Well I don't really know when that will be...
I actually was in a relationship up until recently. But it was an abusive one, sadly. I got cheated on and it was overall very toxic. It was also my first relationship. I miss her but I know that it's wrong and leads nowhere except to more suffering and pain, and I'm trying hard to get over it. I've had an experience and don't know when the next time and try will be. I'll just wait until then. And I hope that next time it will be better.

Everything, everyday, feels like falling apart..... I don't know why, or what it is. Life shouldn't be like this, should it? Why does life feel so..... empty and meaningless? I don't want it to be like that. I want it to be good, I want to be happy. I don't want anyone to feel like how I feel right now. Gosh, where's the way out?

I currently have an idea of a plan. I'm thinking about quitting my job and switching studies, and using the time until next semester to prepare and maybe learn some extra skills..... not having to work everyday surely would have the effect of me being less exhausted and less needy of cooldown, or so I think.... I don't know. I just hope that everything will somehow work out in the end.

I'm scared of the thought of being alone and sad for my whole life, really frightened. If that's life then life isn't worth living. It would be suffering, except for the little up's of it. Well, there would be family... but still suffering. Other than that it would consist of these everyday ""calmers"" that are supposed to distract us from merciless reality for a moment, and gice us some nice feeling... like Netflix for example. I love movies, and series too, but I hardly ever even get to watch something anymore..... I just don't find the power for it. I think that I'm kinda mire addicted to the interactivity stimulation of video games, and need it..... even if I'd rather watch a movie sometimes.

I didn't want to bother anyone with this and I apologize if I did. I just...needed to write this, I don't know why or how it came but it happened, I needed to get this off my soul and just write it down, some kind of venting I guess.....
I don't even know why it was right now.

i cried a lot in 2018 and 2019 but i noticed a trend. i would cry hard but i wouldn’t feel sad after. isn’t the pain supposed to linger and remind you of the hard times?? but no, i slapped on a smile and did a little dance, and somehow i made myself believe that everything is okay. i would keep telling myself that “everything happens for a reason and the best is yet to come.”

one thing you need to know about me is that i’ve never been good at communication. no matter what form: reading/writing/listening. not physically impaired. i just cannot for some reason, express what im feeling. i am extremely emotional (a pure water sign) but i haven’t been able to find an outlet.

ngl, things did get a little better. i started socialising and made some friends. i even started getting along with everybody at home. ever so often, i would distance myself from everyone and sit in my room, feeling numb. this has happened A LOT of times in the past year and i feel like it has accumulated into the “void” i mentioned earlier.

,depression,"# The Wind, One Brilliant Day

*by Antonio Machado*

The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.

""In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.""

""I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.""

""Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.""

The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself: ""What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?""

also, srry if my english is trash i'm not a native speaker, ty

so

i've been struggling a lot with feelings for quite a long time now, i think it has been almost 7 years since i'm at this weird numbness state and it's SO bad.

i can't properly talk with my friends, my hygiene is getting worse, my parents are dealing with really serious health issues, my health is obviously bad as well, i need to think of getting a job and figuring my life out and etc, a lot of stress basically
 but what makes it worse is the fact that even with ALL of this going on, i don't feel sad(?)

my mom literally almost died last year, and i didn't even know what i was supposed to feel, i still don't know actually

the only thing that i feel is anxiety, from times to times(almost every month) i wake up really angry with this emotional numbness, then i have a bad crisis for the entire day, i sleep, and it loops

you know those small details that makes you smile a little? maybe you saw a cute cat, maybe a funny video, just random stuff
even those things don't ""work"", every single time i smile, i feel like i'm just faking it


oh and i struggle a lot if my relationships, i usually ignore my friends for idk how many days, i have no energy to meet new people, but at the same time i don't want to be alone(this sounds so toxic, sorry :/)
this is one of the things that make me feel like complete shit, i feel like i am only SUPPOSED to be their friend instead of actually being it? i always try to be really kind with everyone, but do i actually MEAN it?
i don't even know how to describe this, it's just bad and it makes me sound like a toxic person(and honestly, i probably am, and i hate it)


it's almost like i don't exist, or like i'm just watching my life going on without having control over anything

In addition to this, any mean remarks/ comments from my family just throws me into the gutter. It's like it sucks any remaining energy left and I just crash on my bed wanting to sleep forever. They know how I'm feeling as I am in the midst of a mental breakdown after 4 years of denial how I was feeling and numbing myself with binge watching/eating or either getting dismissed by so called mental health professionals, (for either being too severe to be able to help me or not severe enough to be able to help me) .  I also have the bad habit of replaying unhappy events in my life or even smug remarks from shits laughing at me at school, whom knew nothing of my circumstances- I'm 21 now and hindsight is 20/20 and I acknowledge a lot has happened in my teens so I should cut me some slack for having 0 motivation/ being perceived to be dopey I realize my system was still depressed!!!!

I also find it hard to even be happy over actual positive things - like getting predicted grades in my country to progress to 3rd level. My lack of happiness over such potential good things like a real opportunity of actually getting accepted into  a college makes me just realize how much I must be depressed and in a sad negative head space.

And that&amp;#39;s a reason why I feel so neutral everyday, except for the few days I go to bed crying from a very depressive day. But then again, am I just faking it for attention? I cant tell. I just feel like death is ultimately the only way out of this since happiness is flawed and I dont actually want it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I am new to this subreddit but I am searching for help. I am desperate actually.
I know that healing from depression might be quite a long process but can you guys give me some tips? Unfortunately I cannot afford therapy now and I do not have a lot of friends so basically I m pretty on my own.
I do not have energy of doing anything. After I have one or two productive days (doing chores, doing some workout, maybe study a little bit) I will have a week of staying in home, sleeping 10+hours etc. I am doing almost nothing during the day, cannot find energy even for daily tasks.
If I am not doing anything during the day, I get a little bit anxious during the night before falling asleep.
I had the ""i gotta start now"" and ""i will do it now""  thoughts but unfortunately I had no succes. 
I just feel something is wrong and broken in me and I do not know how to fix it. 
I just feel like I am at the rock bottom. 
I am pretty sure that I can not overcome it alone, but I just need some tips to start, when I ll be able to afford some therapy, definetely I will do it.

I am living alone, I dont have a job, the only hobbies I have are watching TV series, playing a mobile phone game untill I get bored of it and get high. These are not hobbies that I enjoy, just to waste the time.

,depression,"ive been failing since the start of the pandemic, and I think I'm giving up. but my mom wont stop yelling at me about it. shes yelled at me everyday this week. i think my view of her has permanently changed. she prides herself on being a cool mom because she never made me do anything, no chores, after school activities, stuff like that. now I have no skills, I'm very unmotivated, and Im always so anxious when i have to try new things. that's probably because the one time she actually made me try something, it was something i hated so much i sobbed every night about how i didn't want to do it anymore. now whenever she yells at me she brings up how she never makes me do anything, so why cant i just do school? honestly, i think shes a really shitty parent. she constantly makes these empty threats of how shes gonna delete all of my social media apps and get rid of all the things i waste time on, but shes never actually done anything. i cant actually remember a time when shes actually punished me. its always just yelling and screaming empty threats at me. shes threatened to get rid of all my things more times then i can count so i really don't know what shes expecting. at this point i want her to punish me. i don't know why. i just want her to actually go through with it. maybe that's why I'm giving up. maybe i just want to push her to the point she actually punishes me.

i cant stand living with her anymore. i used to never close my bedroom door because i was fine with people. now i always have it closed because i don't want to be around her. everytime she opens it though, because my dog wants to be near me. but it just makes me feel like there's a hundred-pound silver back gorilla outside of my room and shes opening the door so it can get in. i never really relax, and when i do, i constantly feel on edge. even if I'm doing nothing wrong and just relaxing when i have free time, if she comes in i feel terrified.

sometimes, when she finds out Im missing something in school, shell bust into my room like a bat out of hell and just start yelling at me. i don't know what to do anymore. i just don't have any motivation. i feel like a nuke could be dropped outside my apart and id just say ""meh"" at this point. i just don't care about anything anymore, and all her yelling isn't helping. i always feel stressed. even when I'm asleep i feel so on edge. i fucking hate it here. i hate everyone.

world makes no sense  
first everybody will hate you just because you are as you are,as you were born (I DIDN\`T CHOOSE IT why the fuck should i apologise?!?!?!??!), and when they break you, when they reach their goal, then they will hate you twice as much. Because everybody hates insecure, unconfident, quiet, 'negative' people, 'emotional vampires' how they call and people who are not like them, who don\`t talk non-stop about stupid bs and don\`t constantly pretend to  look cool, interesting and funny (who is actually normal unlike them)  FROM BEGINNING, SINCE CHILDHOOD, it runs in their blood (YES they do, don\`t deceive yourself). After what they will *kindly* provide you various *helpful* articles such as 'how to deal with social anxiety', 'how to gain self-confidence', 'why you think everybody hates you', 'how to deal with suicidal thoughts' and at the same time write that such people 'don\`t live their lives and don\`t let others to', 'don\`t approach to them, you don\`t need them in your company' etc. Fucking hypocrites.  


What i am leading to. My theory is getting more and more confirmations with each day. It lies in the fact that psychologists (and people who agree with them) are wrong, all they do is trying to calm down with lies, and i and people like me are right, social anxiety, depression, self hatred and all negative thoughts REFLECT REALITY, answer for all these questions and negative judgments concerning you and attitude of people towards you here from reddit, from quora and other similar sites, from sites for psychological help is YES YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Yes, no one wants you around; no one neither wants you nor needs you; you are always unwanted, outsider; you only disturb and annoy everyone; everyone hates you, doesn\`t want you alive; everyone constantly looks for an opportunity to laugh at you; everyone looks down on you; everyone doesn\`t 'touch' you because/until they have other things to waste energy for; everyone hates weak people and losers; same case with negative thoughts concerning yourself. This is what reality seems to be, just try to google something like 'why people hate insecure people'   


I have other theory according to which - yes it\`s very not fair - people by themselves have the property to feel 'vibes' outgoing from person, and if he is not sociable/talkative (what is the right word) they will notice it and avoid him (not approach); negative thoughts are (for all that) exaggerated, situation is getting worse with lack of social experience (and it is 'snowballing'); and self fulfilling prophecy is real; so we are all just people who are very unlucky for people (lack of good and excess of bad) and conditions to born and grow. Anyway i feel like all these psychological articles don\`t tell the WHOLE truth and miss very important points(things?) because real situation is much more cruel than they describe. I can say for sure that if the first theory isn\`t true then the second is.

It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don&amp;#39;t like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey everyone. 

I've been taking various anti depressants throughout my life until I finally got stuck on venlafaxine. I was unable to get off of it for such a long time (nasty withdrawals) but I'm finally free of it!

It's been about a month without them, and the depressive feeling and suicidal thoughts are getting heavy, but I don't want to depend on medication for the rest of my life (personal choice). 

Do you have any advice on how to best (naturally) alleviate the depression? 

Side note, I know working out is one of the best things, which I don't do often, but if you really feel that's the best option, please let me know!)

Also therapy isn't an option

,depression,"Hi everyone. Well, i was trying to stay away from social networks, but i guess, i have no choice. Especially with all this pandemic situation and lockdowns. Anyway, i was lurking here and there on Reddit (mostly nsfw stuff to cheer myself up) from time to time, so creating account was just matter of time.

I have a depression for more than 6 years (i'm in my mid 20's), sometimes it gets really tough, sometimes it's bereable. I was fighting it myself, with my family, with psychologist and medicaments. Meds really helped a lot (i even began getting second degree, i'd never thought that i'd have energy for this). But meds aren't the solution, luckily, i managed to stop taking them, but depression still keeps coming back.

Psychologist said that i need hobbies, friends and gf. Well, hobbies should be fine, because my baking and cooking skills allow me to make hand-made presents like cakes and sweets and i get requests from my family the year ahead; also i like videogaming, i have small collection of 1.5k games on different platforms; and i don't mention traditional simple hobbies like listening music, reading books etc. Problem with friends and gf. I have none. Never had gf.

**Question(in case you don't want to read my wall of text): Do you really need gf/bf and how it can help or how it affects your life?** I remember when my psychologist was giving me different tests (dumb tests to be honest, not a big fan of psychologists and their books, real life =/= book), one of her first questions was about my gf.

Someone could say something and I then take it the wrong way because of anxiety. I'm constantly paranoid during conversations. I have lost two siblings in the past and now constantly think about death (what if my husband dies) for example but every second of everyday.

Thinking about death is literally constant to the point where sometimes I hold my head in my hands and start crying and just start saying I can't live anymore maybe I'm just not meant for earth. I know this probably sounds maybe like I'm trying to find pity but I really don't I have been suffering so bad. If someone yawns infront of me my head will think for an hour ""did they yawn because their bored of being around me?"" It's so exhausting.

I have been so severely concerned with death that I constantly pray that I will die before my husband because I couldn't go on without my best friend. I don't really have any family as much and as I'm writing this the anxiety is there. I've started feeling the comfort in death with myself.

I know I will fail.

,depression,"27M soon to be 28 and for the 1st time in my life I can honestly say I’ve never been so lost in my life before. Idk how to even starts this because who cares right?

When I was 18 I graduated high school and didn’t have a clue what to doI ended up partying a lot till I was 20 and then grew out of it. Still didn’t know what to do so I just got into construction. Felt like I was doing something because ever company I worked for promised to “teach me the trade”, and I tried just about every field. Weather it was Roofing, Brick Mason, Landscaping, etc. I even tried some factory work and meat cutting, nobody kept their promises. So I decided to put myself in welding school. 

I love welding! It felt right. A lot of people just see the hard work assuming it’s a bad trade but it’s actually really relaxing. I was doing really well, top of my class, and then the pandemic struck. The degree is two years and I only had two more semesters to go. So when I found out the school was shutting down I was crushed. Mainly because I suffer from Crohn’s disease. It an autoimmune disorder so I had to stay in doors. It was a difficult decision. School or  health? Future or present? I choose me. 

Long story short it’s been a year sense I was in school and I feel left behind. School opened back up but I couldn’t go. I tired doing online classes just to keep my grant but because I couldn’t work I couldn’t pay the wifi bill and I got dropped. I was gonna use the extra money from my grant to pay it but it didn’t come in time before they cut off the wifi. By time I actually got the extra money from school the water/gas was off and the electric company was threatening to turn it off. As you can guess I use that money for the bills and groceries. Now I have to pay the school back before I can even sign up for school. I haven’t been able to find work. Granted I’ve  been looking in the Welding industry, but for the past few months I can’t find any work in any field. The stimulus checks were a great help.....at paying over due bills. Still could afford food afterwards. My cabinet and fridge right now are so empty it’s heart breaking honestly, and the bills are ALL over due again.

One day the bird said: “that’s enough!”. he stood on an imaginary legs, and ripped the cage apart, restored few of the stolen bones and flesh. The bird came to a realization: This cage is eternal, so I need to adapt.

,depression,"I  don't know what to do anymore... I'm just so broken I don't know what  to do. Every part of me hurts...every part of me wishes everything would  just end. But I don't want to die. I just want to be happy.

I've  been depressed for well over 10 years. It wasn't until maybe 4 years  ago I was actually diagnosed. I've been on and off so many different  medications it feels like nothing is ever going to work. I've considered  putting myself in the hospital, but that would mean disclosing the  level of my depression to my parents, and I can't do that to them. Not  only can I not handle them worry about me, but I sure can't handle the  constant calls I will get because of it.

Anyways...I  suppose I should tell my story. Part of it anyways. This happened over the past few months and I honestly am starting to question my sanity.  Like I said before, I've been depressed for years. I haven't had a girlfriend in more than 4 years and I haven't had physical relations in over 9 years now. I've been on so many different dating sites and dating  apps I can't keep track of them. But I still try them...because I just  want to find a family. It's degrading and demotivating getting 1 match  every few weeks and then maybe 1 out of 10 people will actually respond.  I used up my freebie swipes on Tinder, Ok Cupid, Bumble, POF, and Hinge  daily for 3 solid months. No hits, nothing. 

Then,  out of the blue this girl messages me on POF. We hadn't even matched.  She was pretty, she was funny, she was pretty amazing. We hit it off.  For the first time in ages I had hope. I was enjoying things again. She  was nervous about meeting with Covid and a few other personal things so  it took a month to get to the point were we were ready for our first  date. It was quickly approaching and I was so excited. I had  reservations at a local restaurant, and everything planned out.

The  day before our date, she disappears off my match list on POF. I panic  and freak out... immediately a wave of depression hit my like a wall.  That voice in the back of the head telling me how useless and worthless I  was cranked itself up to 11. I survived and it took a week...but I got  back online and started swiping again. It was hard..incredibly hard. I  hated swiping, and every person I looked at was a reminder that she was  gone.

But then I found her again. I  quickly messaged her and asked her what happened. To my surprise she  replies. She had apparently reached out to my real number (I had given  it to her previously for the date) and typed my number wrong. The person  on the other end apparently had some not very nice things to say...  Thinking it was me, she blocked me. Anyways we get it sorted and  rescheduled our date for the following weekend.

Two  days before, she comes down with Covid. Yikes. We reschedule for a few  weeks later once she's better. Cool.. not the best of luck so far, but  seems reasonable I guess.

At this  point we started talking on the phone nightly. For hours. Seriously. 2\~3  hours a night for the entire time she was sick. I fell for her hard.  She was amazing and I felt like I could tell her anything. Out date was  fast approaching and I was again getting super excited.

The  day before the date roles around and she tells me she's going over to  her friends place. She doesn't call me that night. The next morning she  texts me saying she had a really rough night. I find out that apparently  her ex BF had shown up after hearing about ""how much of a jerk I was""  (referring of course to the text she had sent to the wrong person). This  ex isn't just any ex, but apparently someone she loved dearly in the  past and felt like 'he was the one that got away'. So anyways, date  canceled. I'm of course thinking things are over before they even  started now. I'm depressed again.. I'm reverting back to my days of  laying in bed for hours because I cant get the motivation to do  anything. Nothing is fun again.

She  tells me she needs some space to work through things.... but that  doesn't work out. We end up on the phone again every night. She tells me  shes working on ending it with her Ex and moving on with her life to be  with me. I'm ecstatic. A week and a half goes by and finally we plan  another date. This is number 3! 3rd times a charm!

The  date gets closer and closer. Two nights before we spend hours on the  phone again talking. Something was up, but I couldn't quite put my  finger on it. I figured it was private and she would tell me when she  was ready. The next night comes around, she tells me shes going over to a  friends again (it's a Friday - this is typical for her). I tell her to  have fun and that I hope we can still chat that night if she's not too  busy. She never calls. I let it go, maybe she fell asleep. Maybe she  lost track of time. I go to sleep for the night.

Then  I get the text. The text that read 'We decided to give it another  shot'. I'm upset, I'm confused. I couldn't figure out what happened. I  didn't even know her ex was going to be there. It's 7:30AM and I'm awake  now. She texts me again, ""I'll call you later. I'm turning off my phone  to sleep because I didn't sleep last night"". And that was that.

6  hours later she texts me. Apparently two days prior she had found one  of my dating profiles that I had forgotten about. Well, rather her  friend had found it and presented it to her. The important thing to note  here is that she had had a previous BF that had had an entire second  life and a family while they were dating. Yep... Hence her anxiety to  meet. Anyways, she had apparently gone to her friends house and her ex  showed up again. They stayed up again talking about ""how much of a jerk I  was."" I apologize profusely. I had no idea that account had been active  all this time. I hadn't gotten any messages or alerts about the  account, I figured I had deleted it. NOPE.

We  spent hours on the phone talking. It took hours to convince her I was  not out dating still. I was still infatuated with her and the thought of  not having her in my life was so painful to think of. But I did it.. We  continued to talk daily on the phone for weeks, until finally we plan a  5th date.

Today was supposed to  be the fifth date. The entire day I spent worrying that something was  going to happen and we wouldn't be able to meet again. Everything was  going smoothly through the day. I text her half hour before our date and  let her know I'm on my way. She sends me a thumbs up. YES! I thought.

I  show up at the parking lot we were going to meet at (we were just going  to go for a walk around a lake). I'm 5 minutes early so I hang out in  my car. 10 minutes pass.. OK she's running a bit late. 15 minutes pass, I  call her. Her phone rings twice and goes to VM. This is where it got  weird. Her voicemail changed. Instead of it saying her name, it was now  just saying her phone number.  I leave a quick message saying I'm there  and am super excited.

20 minutes pass

30 minutes pass

I've now called her 4 times and texted her 3 times. No response. Nothing.

I go home. I write up this message. I cry myself to sleep because I'm going to die alone.

My  best friend is a social worker. I can't tell him any of this. Every  time I try to, he wants to send me to the hospital. I have no one to  talk to. I just quit my job yesterday because my manager was such a  prick I couldn't take it anymore. I thought with her I could make it  through this tough time... but now this. I'm unemployed, family-less,  broke out of my mind, and I have no one. I'm so alone... What is the  point any more? I can't find anything enjoyable. I don't want to see  people. I don't want to move. I just want things to end.",t2_byonztyx,False,,0,False,Hate my life... whats the point anymore..

I&amp;#39;m just so broken I don&amp;#39;t know what  to do. Every part of me hurts...every part of me wishes everything would  just end. But I don&amp;#39;t want to die. I just want to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve  been depressed for well over 10 years. It wasn&amp;#39;t until maybe 4 years  ago I was actually diagnosed. I&amp;#39;ve been on and off so many different  medications it feels like nothing is ever going to work. I&amp;#39;ve considered  putting myself in the hospital, but that would mean disclosing the  level of my depression to my parents, and I can&amp;#39;t do that to them. Not  only can I not handle them worry about me, but I sure can&amp;#39;t handle the  constant calls I will get because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways...I  suppose I should tell my story. Part of it anyways. This happened over the past few months and I honestly am starting to question my sanity.  Like I said before, I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for years. I haven&amp;#39;t had a girlfriend in more than 4 years and I haven&amp;#39;t had physical relations in over 9 years now. I&amp;#39;ve been on so many different dating sites and dating  apps I can&amp;#39;t keep track of them. But I still try them...because I just  want to find a family. It&amp;#39;s degrading and demotivating getting 1 match  every few weeks and then maybe 1 out of 10 people will actually respond.  I used up my freebie swipes on Tinder, Ok Cupid, Bumble, POF, and Hinge  daily for 3 solid months. No hits, nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then,  out of the blue this girl messages me on POF. We hadn&amp;#39;t even matched.  She was pretty, she was funny, she was pretty amazing. We hit it off.  For the first time in ages I had hope. I was enjoying things again. She  was nervous about meeting with Covid and a few other personal things so  it took a month to get to the point were we were ready for our first  date. It was quickly approaching and I was so excited. I had  reservations at a local restaurant, and everything planned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  day before our date, she disappears off my match list on POF. I panic  and freak out... immediately a wave of depression hit my like a wall.  That voice in the back of the head telling me how useless and worthless I  was cranked itself up to 11. I survived and it took a week...but I got  back online and started swiping again.

,depression,"Got diagnosed with cancer last year because of which I had to quit working. Few months down the line my savings started quickly evaporating and eventually turned into pennies.

Physically unable to work and desperate for a source of income I withdrew a line of credit made available to me via a credit app. I tried to put that money in stock market, to see if I can earn from trading. I wasn't a newbie in the market but only had experience investing and not trading.

Fast forward today, I'm miserable. There are not many job openings because of the pandemic and I am in debt. 

I don't know what I am gonna do. I wish I never got diagnosed with cancer. Life was pretty okay for me before that and everything started going downhill since. 

In the past few months I have often thought that it would have been better if I didn't make it out alive after the operation or from chemo. While on chemo most of the nights I felt like I may not wake up the next morning. I wish that would have turned true.

I feel like cancer has fucking destroyed my life. I always wonder how great life would have been if I hadn't gotten diagnosed. I'm in my early 20s for fucks sake. No one at this age neither expects or is ready for these things. Yet somehow I ended up in it.

I never thought, I would one day end up in debt. I was pretty great at managing my money. And for someone at my age I had a pretty decent savings as well. Cancer fucking took everything from me and it continues to do so.

Not only the above, but it has fucked me up emotionally. None of my friends understand what was it like for me. Everyone expects me to behave normally or as if it didn't happen. As if everything is okay now that I am cured.

But the truth is it did happened and it fucked me up real bad. I cannot turn a blind eye to it, I cannot live normally after going through the trauma and I don't even feel like living anymore at this point.

It has, eventually rendered me broke and miserable. Something I never imagined in my wildest of thoughts.

,depression,"April 08, 04:24 AM - I received a call at midnight that my mother breathed her last. Upon hearing this I went numb and dead inside. I didn’t know how to react. How does one react to a news like this? 

I lost my father almost 23 years ago and my mother was my world. More often than not in my existence of 30 years on earth, I have struggled to meet eye to eye with my mother, and yet it feels like someone has ripped my heart out completely. She WAS my place of love, rage, anger, pain - she was my place to complain and that’s probably the most propelling beauty of a mother-daughter relationship - she was my place of everything. 

The insurmountable pain in my heart and the grief is too very real to overcome. I feel like I can’t breathe. She was suffering from third stage of cancer, COPD, and slowly her organ shut down. I get calls and messages from people everyday telling me to be strong. But all I want to do is shout at the top of my lungs and telling them that “I don’t want to be strong. I want to be vulnerable and I want to cry” but I cannot because I feel dead inside.

Why doesn’t society normalise grieving even when it says it does? Why does it see being vulnerable even at the worst moments as the sign of weakness? I cannot sleep at night, I cannot cry, and often it is so hard to breathe. My heart aches so much but those damn tears just won’t come. I feel like my life has no purpose and I am alone in this world and that feeling is so scary that I have panic attacks almost everyday. 

I am a 30-year old orphan battling a domestic violence case against my estranged husband and although I have friends and relatives, it is just not the same. It’s those little things that my mom did, even as simple as a phone call everyday to ask me if I have eaten that I terribly miss. 

My father committed suicide and I have been suicidal prone and attempted many times in the past. And with mom gone, I feel like my life has no meaning, no purpose and it is just so hard to carry on. And the worst part is, I don’t even know how to grieve. The sleeplessness, the depression, the anxiety is killing me slowly. 

I have been strong all my life, through my father’s death, through childhood sexual abuses, through getting raped, through a bad marriage and domestic violence, through a heart attack at just 29, and through battling COVID in a hospital - but I can no longer have the strength to carry on.

,depression,"First of all, sorry for my English, I'm not a native. Anyway, I hope I will express myself intelligibly.

Frankly, I don't expect some solution. And I don't think that I'm alone in this trouble. So, I would like to know how you deal with feelings like these.

Where to start?

I'm human. (At least I'm trying.) And as a human, I'm not always good. I know how bad I am in some aspects, and this consciousness is too depressing. When I try don't think about that, I don't feel quite like myself. I want to remember it. It's too important for me. But I feel so bad then that I'm incapable do anything good to be a slightly better person. That's funny how paradoxical it is.

Honestly, I want to die due to this feeling, but I can't kill myself, because of my sister and mother. I can't kill myself when they're alive. I certainly don't want to hurt them.

It will sound stupid, but I even wanted to start smoking because I would maybe die sooner. And because it's soothing (and I feel anxious all the time). But I can't even smoke because I don't want to support animal testing connected with cigarette production.

The only thing I like to do is writing, but everything I write I instantly hate and destroy.

All in all, I think I'm too weak to living. I deeply admire other people, but I'm also scared of them. I can't stand that cruelty that is so connected with mere existence. My comfort is redeemed by the suffering of others, less fortunate, and I hate living. And it's so unfair. I'm so ungrateful, but I can't help myself.

,depression,"I'm 19 and I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life. I have no purpose. My self-destructive behavior and the crippling numbness I'm enduring is all too much. Between the pressure from my mother of wanting me to success in life, having to decide which college I'm gonna go to and the fact that I'm confused about my own sexuality makes me want to end my life. But the truth is, I don't even know if I really want to die. I think I just don't want to exist anymore. There's a difference. I've thought about killing myself but I never had the courage to do it because I'm afraid to suffer or even feel pain. My mind has taken me to dark places. As silly as it is, I even thought about hiring a hitman to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. I don't think I feel sad. I just feel empty. I mean, I am sad, but mostly I just feel empty. I find myself thinking about committing suicide because I'm going to die eventually so why should I wait for that time when I can end all this suffering now? I think about the cycle of life and I just become even more hesitant to live. I mean what happens even if I survive college? Get a job, get married, have kids and eventually have my marriage fall apart after years of loveless sex and then die. I kind of want to skip all of those things and just be...gone. But like I said, I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. And another thing is, I don't know if I even wanna be in a relationship. I've always known that I don't wanna be with someone. I can't even take care of myself let alone take care of a girlfriend. I guess part of the reason why I'm afraid of commitment is because I'm surrounded by abusive relationships. I always hear my sister and her girlfriend beat up and yell at each other in the next room and when my dad was around, he used to beat me up and my sisters. He never hit mom which is a good thing, I guess. Every time he and my mom got into an argument, he would blame us and punish us. I remember this one time, when I was eight, he got so mad he lifted me up and strangled me. He wasn't a bad father. Only when he was angry. He wasn't a bad husband either, except for when he cheated on my mom which he did more than once. But what I'm feeling now has nothing to do with my terrible childhood. Anyway, some of my friends would tell me to find somebody to love because it helps but I don't think having a girlfriend is gonna fill the void. I don't know what will, but being in a relationship certainly won't fix what's broken inside of me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no one to talk to. My entire family is busy with their own lives. My dad abandoned us when I was ten, my two siblings are dealing with their own shit and even if they weren't, I don't think I can ever open up to them without feeling like I'm being judged and I can't even talk to my mom without her pressuring me to go to college. That's the thing with my mom. She wants things to work out exactly as she planned it. She wants me to finish college so she can have something to brag about. I have two siblings and I'm the youngest. One of my sisters started college but didn't finish and the other was not interested to study at all. Because I'm the youngest child, the only child she has who might actually have a chance to finish college, she pushes me too hard to the point that the pressure is too much to handle. It's like she doesn't care about what I want. The responsibility of going to college is tethered to me, and I don't have a choice. Don't get me wrong, my mom loves me. God knows I'm not a perfect son. I did a lot of shitty things to her in the past and she forgave no matter how fucked up my wrongdoings were. That's why I also think I'm obligated to finish college, to repay her for the things I've done. I have a best friend who I think I rely on too much. The sad part is, I don't think he considers me as his best friend because he's got other friends who he has known for years and it's hard to comepete with that, but it's okay. I've got other friends who I can try to talk to but I don't think they'll understand what I'm going through because they're so happy and contented with their lives. Unlike me. I'd like to be that type of person who doesn't give a shit what anyone thinks but unfortunately, I do. Some of my friends can sense that something's off about me. My best friend notices that my vibe's not right. I don't know if I want to tell them about my constant loss of will to live. I don't know if I'm willing to open up to them. I don't know if I want to be emotionally naked in front of anyone, if I'm being honest. I always jump to conclusions and think that if I do open up to them, they would just think that I'm fishing for attention by acting sad. Most of my friends know exactly they want to do with their lives. I guess I do too, (I want to be an author or a film director) but with my lack of confidence, I don't think I'm gonna get there. I wouldn't say I'm dumb and I would never call myself a genius in a million years either. I know things but it's not enough. I think I'm too stupid for college. That's one of the reasons why choosing a school is a lot of pressure for me. I have no idea if I'm just plain stupid or if I have a learning disability. Because I don't think my brain is wired correctly. This isn't normal.

I thought I hit rock bottom years ago, when I was bullied back in high school. I skipped school for a whole month because I didn't want to face my bullies. I got picked on, hit, laughed at and humiliated. I was beaten up physically and emotionally and it scarred me for life. Because of that trauma, my friends can't even hit me jokingly without looking like a pussy. But I never thought about killing myself then. And it makes me wonder if I prefer the constant embarrassment and humiliation I felt back then than what I'm feeling now. I guess I've always been broken but I didn't realize it until a couple of months ago. I try to be happy and I guess I am when I'm surrounded by my friends but when they're gone and I'm all by myself, I'm back to being miserable.

Sometimes, I think about hooking up with random people to temporarily fill the void and numb the pain because I don't wanna be left alone with my own thoughts. But that shit won't last for long. The thing is, I've always been an introvert. I hate being around people I don't know. But these days, I don't wanna be alone because I'm scared of my myself. I loathe myself. I hate me and the fucked up bit is I can't get away from me. I can never escape myself. Funny how I try to convince me that I love myself but the truth is, I don't. It fascinates me how people can love themselves and mean it. Meamwhile, I hate the person I've become. I hate being alone with myself because the thoughts that I have are crushing me. I don't want to feel this way but at the same time, I know I'm responsible because I'm the one who creates my own thoughts. I'm also afraid that my constant need for distraction comes off as desperation for attention toward my friends, who I'd ask to hang out with every once in a while to keep me off my thoughts even though I know they have their own lives that doesn't revolve around me. I'm afraid of losing my closest friends and my best friend. I can feel them slipping away. I'm afraid of myself for wanting to kill myself. I'm afraid of a lot of things. I just wish someone had the answer to tell me what to do because my mind is not in the right place. I want it to stop. I don't necessarily want to die, I just don't want to exist.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I have no one to talk to. My entire family is busy with their own lives. My dad abandoned us when I was ten, my two siblings are dealing with their own shit and even if they weren&amp;#39;t, I don&amp;#39;t think I can ever open up to them without feeling like I&amp;#39;m being judged and I can&amp;#39;t even talk to my mom without her pressuring me to go to college. That&amp;#39;s the thing with my mom. She wants things to work out exactly as she planned it. She wants me to finish college so she can have something to brag about. I have two siblings and I&amp;#39;m the youngest. One of my sisters started college but didn&amp;#39;t finish and the other was not interested to study at all. Because I&amp;#39;m the youngest child, the only child she has who might actually have a chance to finish college, she pushes me too hard to the point that the pressure is too much to handle. It&amp;#39;s like she doesn&amp;#39;t care about what I want. The responsibility of going to college is tethered to me, and I don&amp;#39;t have a choice. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, my mom loves me. God knows I&amp;#39;m not a perfect son. I did a lot of shitty things to her in the past and she forgave no matter how fucked up my wrongdoings were. That&amp;#39;s why I also think I&amp;#39;m obligated to finish college, to repay her for the things I&amp;#39;ve done. I have a best friend who I think I rely on too much. The sad part is, I don&amp;#39;t think he considers me as his best friend because he&amp;#39;s got other friends who he has known for years and it&amp;#39;s hard to comepete with that, but it&amp;#39;s okay. I&amp;#39;ve got other friends who I can try to talk to but I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll understand what I&amp;#39;m going through because they&amp;#39;re so happy and contented with their lives. Unlike me. I&amp;#39;d like to be that type of person who doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit what anyone thinks but unfortunately, I do. Some of my friends can sense that something&amp;#39;s off about me. My best friend notices that my vibe&amp;#39;s not right. I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to tell them about my constant loss of will to live. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m willing to open up to them. I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to be emotionally naked in front of anyone, if I&amp;#39;m being honest. I always jump to conclusions and think that if I do open up to them, they would just think that I&amp;#39;m fishing for attention by acting sad. Most of my friends know exactly they want to do with their lives. I guess I do too, (I want to be an author or a film director) but with my lack of confidence, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m gonna get there. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m dumb and I would never call myself a genius in a million years either. I know things but it&amp;#39;s not enough. I think I&amp;#39;m too stupid for college. That&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why choosing a school is a lot of pressure for me. I have no idea if I&amp;#39;m just plain stupid or if I have a learning disability. Because I don&amp;#39;t think my brain is wired correctly. This isn&amp;#39;t normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I hit rock bottom years ago, when I was bullied back in high school. I skipped school for a whole month because I didn&amp;#39;t want to face my bullies. I got picked on, hit, laughed at and humiliated. I was beaten up physically and emotionally and it scarred me for life. Because of that trauma, my friends can&amp;#39;t even hit me jokingly without looking like a pussy. But I never thought about killing myself then. And it makes me wonder if I prefer the constant embarrassment and humiliation I felt back then than what I&amp;#39;m feeling now. I guess I&amp;#39;ve always been broken but I didn&amp;#39;t realize it until a couple of months ago. I try to be happy and I guess I am when I&amp;#39;m surrounded by my friends but when they&amp;#39;re gone and I&amp;#39;m all by myself, I&amp;#39;m back to being miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I think about hooking up with random people to temporarily fill the void and numb the pain because I don&amp;#39;t wanna be left alone with my own thoughts. But that shit won&amp;#39;t last for long. The thing is, I&amp;#39;ve always been an introvert. I hate being around people I don&amp;#39;t know. But these days, I don&amp;#39;t wanna be alone because I&amp;#39;m scared of my myself. I loathe myself. I hate me and the fucked up bit is I can&amp;#39;t get away from me. I can never escape myself. Funny how I try to convince me that I love myself but the truth is, I don&amp;#39;t. It fascinates me how people can love themselves and mean it. Meamwhile, I hate the person I&amp;#39;ve become. I hate being alone with myself because the thoughts that I have are crushing me. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel this way but at the same time, I know I&amp;#39;m responsible because I&amp;#39;m the one who creates my own thoughts. I&amp;#39;m also afraid that my constant need for distraction comes off as desperation for attention toward my friends, who I&amp;#39;d ask to hang out with every once in a while to keep me off my thoughts even though I know they have their own lives that doesn&amp;#39;t revolve around me. I&amp;#39;m afraid of losing my closest friends and my best friend. I can feel them slipping away. I&amp;#39;m afraid of myself for wanting to kill myself. I&amp;#39;m afraid of a lot of things. I just wish someone had the answer to tell me what to do because my mind is not in the right place. I want it to stop. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to die, I just don&amp;#39;t want to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, I just wanna say thank you. I really needed to get this out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Nakakapagod na. In english 'its so tiring'

When you want to be better, when you wanna do better but you can't. This past few months I feel like I'm trapped in a loophole of negative energy. I am always tired even though I get enough sleep. I get easily irritated with small things. Suddenly I'm no longer interested with the things I'm good at. Small chores makes me tired. Sometimes cry for no reason, but there are days that I don't feel anything. Empty. 

And what's worse is I can't even tell this to my family or my friends because I'm afraid of how they will react. I don't know if they can absorb the fact that I'm not mentally stable.

,depression,"I'm honestly dumbfounded every time I remember the week I planned to end it all.

The details are engraved into my memories, because what happened to me is gonna make me sound completely crazy.

please don't judge me, I'm genuinely confused about this part of my life, I cry when I try to make sense of it. I really need this off my shoulders... I advise you not to read my story if you are sensitive to anything related to suicide. Nothing to depict, but it's brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started when my ex had left me, almost 3 years ago. I did nothing but look down on myself for treating him badly. I hurt him in ways I never intended, and I was ready to accept my fate to avoid further destruction. All my life till that point, I was nothing but an anchor on anyone I came across.    
I had planned to starve and dehydrate myself the week of Spring Break, 2018. 

But one night, maybe a few days before Thursday(the day I decided), I closed my eyes and pleaded in my own thoughts for someone to save me. I wanted a sign of hope, a sign that I had a future ahead of me, a sign that at least one person cared about me. And the night before Thursday, my ex's grandma had texted me to check up on me.

She never texted me up until that point. 

I keep running it over and over in my head, wondering if I somehow spilled my plans to someone. At some point I convinced myself that I texted someone about it, cause it's the only thing that makes sense. I thought that somehow, maybe religion was real... The way I pleaded, seemed like a prayer. My ex's grandma was religious. Theoretically, those dots connect. But realistically, it makes no sense. Mainly cause I'm just not religious. Maybe she simply cared about me...something I shouldn't deny..

&lt;p&gt;The details are engraved into my memories, because what happened to me is gonna make me sound completely crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please don&amp;#39;t judge me, I&amp;#39;m genuinely confused about this part of my life, I cry when I try to make sense of it. I really need this off my shoulders... I advise you not to read my story if you are sensitive to anything related to suicide. Nothing to depict, but it&amp;#39;s brief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started when my ex had left me, almost 3 years ago. I did nothing but look down on myself for treating him badly. I hurt him in ways I never intended, and I was ready to accept my fate to avoid further destruction. All my life till that point, I was nothing but an anchor on anyone I came across.&lt;br/&gt;
I had planned to starve and dehydrate myself the week of Spring Break, 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one night, maybe a few days before Thursday(the day I decided), I closed my eyes and pleaded in my own thoughts for someone to save me. I wanted a sign of hope, a sign that I had a future ahead of me, a sign that at least one person cared about me. And the night before Thursday, my ex&amp;#39;s grandma had texted me to check up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was completely in shock, as I never pleaded out loud or to anyone. I never shared my plans, and even made sure nobody could&amp;#39;ve found out. I never wrote it down or typed it anywhere. Yet, my pleads got somewhere somehow. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The cause of the depression might be due to something repressed drawing the mental energy form conscious and lowering the cognitive functions , causing an introversion of the libido (mental energy) .

DR Carl Jung the swiss psychiatrist writes :

"" It is a slackening of the tensity of consciousness, which might be compared to a low barometric reading, presaging bad weather. The tonus has given way, and this is felt subjectively as listlessness, moroseness, and depression. One no longer has any wish or courage to face the tasks of the day. One feels like lead, because no part of one's body seems willing to move, and this is due to the fact that one no longer has any disposable energy. This well-known phenomenon corresponds to the primitive's loss of soul.

.... Abaissement du niveau mental can be the result of physical and mental fatigue, bodily illness, violent emotions, and shock, of which the last has a particularly deleterious effect on one's self-assurance. The abaissement always has a restrictive influence on the personality as a whole. ....""CW9

""the future appears hopeless and empty. But what robs Nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is the habit of looking back for something that used to be outside, instead of looking inside, into the depths of the depressive state. This looking back leads to regression and is the first step along that path. Regression is also an involuntary introversion in so far as the past is an object of memory and therefore a psychic content, an endopsychic factor. It is a relapse into the past caused by a depression in the present.

Depression should therefore be regarded as an unconscious compensation whose content must be made conscious if it is to be fully effective. This can only be done by consciously regressing along with the depressive tendency and integrating the memories so activated into the conscious mind—which was what the depression was aiming at in the first place"" Jung CW 5

""My patient was a very clever young man who had been intellectually enlightened as to the cause of his neurosis by a lengthy analysis. However, intellectual understanding made no difference to his depression. In cases of this sort the doctor should spare himself the useless trouble of delving still further into the causality; for, when a more or less exhaustive understanding is of no avail, the discovery of yet another little bit of causality will be of no avail either. The unconscious has simply gained an unassailable ascendency; it wields an attractive force that can invalidate all conscious contents—in other words, it can withdraw libido from the conscious world and thereby produce a “depression,” an abaissement du niveau mental (Janet). But as a result of this we must, according to the law of energy, expect an accumulation of value—i.e., libido—in the unconscious.

Libido can never be apprehended except in a definite form; that is to say, it is identical with fantasy-images. And we can only release it from the grip of the unconscious by bringing up the corresponding fantasy-images. That is why, in a case like this, we give the unconscious a chance to bring its fantasies to the surface. .... It is characteristic of the nature of the unconscious psyche that it is sufficient unto itself and knows no human considerations.

Once a thing has fallen into the unconscious it is retained there, regardless of whether the conscious mind suffers or not. The latter can hunger and freeze, while everything in the unconscious becomes verdant and blossoms.

So at least it appears at first. But when we look deeper, we find that this unconcern of the unconscious has a meaning, indeed a purpose and a goal. There are psychic goals that lie beyond the conscious goals; in fact, they may even be inimical to them. But we find that the unconscious has an inimical or ruthless bearing towards the conscious only when the latter adopts a false or pretentious attitude

...when a fit of depression comes upon him, he must no longer force himself to some kind of work in order to forget, but must accept his depression and give it a hearing. Now this is the direct opposite of succumbing to a mood, which is so typical of neurosis. It is no weakness, no spineless surrender, but a hard achievement, the essence of which consists in keeping your objectivity despite the temptations of the mood, and in making the mood your object, instead of allowing it to become in you the dominating subject.

,depression,"First off, I couldn't give a crap about my university grades. I do not for a second believe that a degree will help me where I'm going. I have some pretty good talents in a field people are still mostly naive about and I have an artistic vision that I believe is pretty strong in another field I want to pursue. Most of the famous and accomplished people in that field/industry I want to work in either didn't finish college or didn't go to it. So, I'm only attending college now for emotional enrichment, emotional independence, and because my father wants me to. That brings me to my next point.

My dad is unfortunately a very conservative, harsh and traditional person. He absolutely reviles his own generations for the sex and lsd. He thinks all democrats are evil communists. He hates gay people and trans people and thinks that gay people should be treated for their disorder ""but the democrats got rid of mental care for these gay people."" 80% of the words that come out of his mouth are disparaging about some type of groups of people. Like ""Oh that girls a slut. Look at those awful tattoos."" or ""these gay retards are blah blah blah."" He's like a toxicity machine but he doesn't realize it because he still believes that I agree with all the batshit insane garbage he spews. Spoiler, I don't. My father hates the world. He hates most people. But I still love him. He's an incredibly hard worker and he's been screwed over so many times in his life that I understand his anger. But it doesn't change the fact that he is an intimidating and slightly manipulative person. I personally think he's an emotionally abusive person but I can't confirm if he falls in that group. 

I didn't want to go to college after high school. High school was the worst 4 years of my life and I wanted to take a year and 2 summers to relax and not deal with any assignments or tests. I wanted to get a job and start making a small amount of money in addition to getting work experience. The last thing in the world that I wanted was to go straight into college after HS but alas that is what happened. However, in college, the first semester at least, I started to feel very happy and non stressed out now that I was about 2 hours away from him. I never had, and still never have, done any type of drugs or had sex. But just the separation and the calm felt so nice. I enjoyed my first semester. And halfway into my second semester, covid hit and everything went online. That's where everything started to fell apart. I have had 3 bad semesters in a row. A year and a half of low grades, barely escaping academic suspension, and covid grade. Now it looks like things will finally be back to in person classes coming this fall.

This semester has been my worst. I haven't done a majority of the work. I have been depressed. I have been ""attending class"" this entire year in this house where he is the only other person. It has taken a toll on me a little bit. I just stopped doing the work. I didn't feel compelled to do it. I then said to myself ""Oh, I'll do the late work tomorrow."" But then late work built up and I got into the headspace that I can't finish the recent late work until I submitted the older late work. But I never did either. Tomorrow's my last day of finals. I have accepted the failure and plan on zeroing out all my grades with Covid grades and starting small next semester. Again, I don't care much for college. I just want to go back to that down again. It's such a nice place and my life was calm away from my dad. I was infact so un stressed that I began losing weight like crazy. I just felt good. Again. I love my father. If he were to die I would be sad. He's been dealt a real shitty hand in life and I want to find a way to be supportive of him but also not actually have to deal with him.

I do not for a second believe that a degree will help me where I&amp;#39;m going. I have some pretty good talents in a field people are still mostly naive about and I have an artistic vision that I believe is pretty strong in another field I want to pursue. Most of the famous and accomplished people in that field/industry I want to work in either didn&amp;#39;t finish college or didn&amp;#39;t go to it. So, I&amp;#39;m only attending college now for emotional enrichment, emotional independence, and because my father wants me to. That brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad is unfortunately a very conservative, harsh and traditional person. He absolutely reviles his own generations for the sex and lsd. He thinks all democrats are evil communists. He hates gay people and trans people and thinks that gay people should be treated for their disorder &amp;quot;but the democrats got rid of mental care for these gay people.&amp;quot; 80% of the words that come out of his mouth are disparaging about some type of groups of people. Like &amp;quot;Oh that girls a slut. Look at those awful tattoos.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;these gay retards are blah blah blah.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s like a toxicity machine but he doesn&amp;#39;t realize it because he still believes that I agree with all the batshit insane garbage he spews. Spoiler, I don&amp;#39;t. My father hates the world. He hates most people. But I still love him. He&amp;#39;s an incredibly hard worker and he&amp;#39;s been screwed over so many times in his life that I understand his anger. But it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that he is an intimidating and slightly manipulative person. I personally think he&amp;#39;s an emotionally abusive person but I can&amp;#39;t confirm if he falls in that group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want to go to college after high school. High school was the worst 4 years of my life and I wanted to take a year and 2 summers to relax and not deal with any assignments or tests. I wanted to get a job and start making a small amount of money in addition to getting work experience. The last thing in the world that I wanted was to go straight into college after HS but alas that is what happened. However, in college, the first semester at least, I started to feel very happy and non stressed out now that I was about 2 hours away from him. I never had, and still never have, done any type of drugs or had sex. But just the separation and the calm felt so nice. I enjoyed my first semester. And halfway into my second semester, covid hit and everything went online. That&amp;#39;s where everything started to fell apart. I have had 3 bad semesters in a row. A year and a half of low grades, barely escaping academic suspension, and covid grade. Now it looks like things will finally be back to in person classes coming this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester has been my worst. I haven&amp;#39;t done a majority of the work. I have been depressed. I have been &amp;quot;attending class&amp;quot; this entire year in this house where he is the only other person. It has taken a toll on me a little bit. I just stopped doing the work. I didn&amp;#39;t feel compelled to do it. I then said to myself &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ll do the late work tomorrow.&amp;quot; But then late work built up and I got into the headspace that I can&amp;#39;t finish the recent late work until I submitted the older late work. But I never did either. Tomorrow&amp;#39;s my last day of finals. I have accepted the failure and plan on zeroing out all my grades with Covid grades and starting small next semester. Again, I don&amp;#39;t care much for college. I just want to go back to that down again. It&amp;#39;s such a nice place and my life was calm away from my dad. I was infact so un stressed that I began losing weight like crazy. I just felt good. Again. I love my father. If he were to die I would be sad. He&amp;#39;s been dealt a real shitty hand in life and I want to find a way to be supportive of him but also not actually have to deal with him. Living in a dorm 2 hours away seemed to fit that nice balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m leading to is this. I fear what he thinks of me and I fear his intimidating talks with me. I don&amp;#39;t want to talk to him about my grades. I just fucking don&amp;#39;t.

Social media is stupid, it makes you compare yourself with people who seem to have a better life than you. So I deleted most social media but still, even outside of social media, people tend to be doing much better than you. They have better houses, cars, clothes, a relationship, etc. I have none.

I have always been an individualist in most activities in my life - never really got used to having people around as I didn't stay in the same place for long periods of time. I was a shy kid, but pretty confident in whatever I was good at.

WFH had a net negative impact on my social interactions. The extended working hours really slung me into depression in 2020.  
I eventually quit the job and took up freelance work that pays me just more than what my generously cushy job was offering, but I do not know what I want to do long term.

,depression,"In 2009, I tried to take my own life. I have gotten help since then, and still see a psychiatrist and psychologist. When the pandemic happened a year ago, I wanted to post something to try and help people cope, but got scared to share how I feel. While these feelings still creep in and some days I just feel like ""what is the point""? so I am going to post what I left for everyone; not to glorify what I tried to do, but because every single time I read this now, I know I have so much to live for. (I am now 30, single, and no kids) I hope this helps even one single person take a moment before harming yourself. 

First, I'm sorry. Sorry you ever spoke a word to me or had to hear me speak a word. Sorry you had to meet me, and sorry you are reading this if you have gotten this far. Please don't take this the wrong way, this is just a petty explanantion if anyone wanted one. I wasted an opportunity to be a shining light on this world, and spent my time blowing out the flames. I've taken advantage of everyone and everything I could have. I lost everyone close to me and only blame myself. I made the conscious effort to slowly peel away from society. I've been half-assing my way through everything in life, and keep taking all that I can. It's petty and pathetic to say, but I truly wish I had never been
born. If I go out on my terms, my organs would be deemed useless and unable to help those who need them, and they can help many who are in dire need in order to live. I am but a hollow corpse waiting to seize the moment. I know I wouldn't leave a mess for anyone to see, that would
be too tough on my family. I've been detached from nearly every emotion, and feel nothing. It's crazy to think
that a thought in the mind can be felt in the inner workings of a person. Maybe I am rationalizing, but this isn't depression, it's something more, something much more. I hpe to
say farewell to those who took time and attempted to make a connection with me. I couldn't tell you how many times you have gotten me through ""tough"" times in my life. Tough in quotations as they weren't tough at all, I was just, and continue to be, too weak willed. I used to want to be the center of attention, but that quickly dissipated.
I long for the moment when I can easily fade away without much discussion or notice, but I can't pinpoint the exact moment when I felt so pathetic and unnessesary. I feel as if i belong in the background, so no one really notices, maybe that way the ""loss"" is miniscule. I was the one who chose to distort and or not pursue further personal relationships and instead sought momentary self-satisfaction. I severed countless opportunities because l only thought of myself. I always wondered what people saw in me that I never saw in myself, then before the end, I made them question their own judgement into why they thought they saw anything in me as well. The doubts and questions placed into their mind, and hurt into their heart was my fault. Not that anyone was ever physically hurt, but emotionally damaged. Even if it was not a lasting pain and only for a split-second, nothing I can do can make up for that damage I caused. Again, this is not a plea for attention or a cry for help, nor is this a farewell or goodbye. This is simply a poor attempt to answer any questions that may arise.

Lastly, I am sorry to my family. I love you all so much, even though I have never shown it. You were always there for me no matter how shitty of a person I became. To my mom and dad, I am so sorry I wasn't the son you envisioned. I know I am a disappointment, and I only blame myself. You two deserved a better son, with everything you have done for me. You wanted me to become something, but I still fell flat on my face. I wish you had another son, one to make you proud to point him out. One who made a difference. One who truly mattered.

I was still the depressed/suicidal kid i had always been, and nothing seemed to be working. I was two states away from my friends and family, and was growing more and more sad everyday. I finally had to just transfer back to my local university after the semester away because i couldn’t handle it anymore. Things slowly seemed to be better, i had a job, i had a girlfriend, i was getting good grades, i was hanging out with my friends everyday, everything seemed to be going well for me. Not trying to sit here and have people on reddit feel sorry for me, ill spare the details on how things went so south. My girlfriend and i broke up, my grades were rapidly declining, and in turn i quit my job to focus on getting my grades up before the end of the semester, and i rarely get to see my friends anymore. Typing this up really makes me miss my girlfriend more and more, as she was the only person in my life that i could talk to about these feelings of wanting to end my lousy existence. Idk i just feel as if the thought “hey i could really just end my life to avoid these feelings that have been haunting me for so long” has been in my head a lot in the past few months. Anyways, sorry for the long pity party, just didnt know where else to write this.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello everyone. Long 9 paragraph post ahead.

A bit of background before I explain things. I'm the eldest child of three. My dad works in a manager position while my mom is a stay at home parent. The current negative state of my family is due to all five of us in some way but the ones who contribute to it the most, in my opinion, are my mom and youngest sibling.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As I mentioned, my mother is a stay at home parent. She left her last job almost two decades ago and has been running the house ever since. Throughout my time with her, I have seen her go through at least two phases: her less religious phase and her current more religious phase. During her less religious phase which overlaps with the time she was working, she would often micro-manage my studies to such an extent that she would expect me to study a set number of hours a day which was about 6 hours a day for different subjects and fill in those hours in a book that she would check every night. If I did not fulfill those 6 hours, the remaining time would be carried over the next day. She eventually dropped that system. When she became more religious, she started expecting the entire family to take part in a number of religious rituals like sprinkling salted water around the house while reciting holy text.

One thing consistent about her is that she has always practiced a very strict form of parenting. She used to expect us to maintain our grades high and she would dictate the way we dressed and our haircuts. She has friends from teenage years. In comparison to my siblings and I, her friends' children are a lot more successful than her children. Some of those friends' children have extremely impressive career resumes, some have their own businesses, some are very talented and some are just very sociable that you can't help but like them. My siblings and I are nothing compared to them. Whenever I get into an argument with her, she would keep a cold shoulder to the entire immediate family. When she and I finally sit down to resolve the argument, she always manages to manipulate the situation where she comes out the victim and the winner. 

Every other day, she has mood swings that are unpredictable. Sometimes she's talkative and sometimes she's moody and when she's moody, she's very moody. When she's moody, she's like that for several days and spreads her moodiness to everyone in the immediate family. She's like that even to my father who works so hard and is always soft-spoken and kind to her. When I was younger, she would expect her children to always sit down and almost never talk during meals. As a result, every time my family goes out to eat, we almost NEVER talk at the table in the restaurant. I look around and envy other groups in the restaurant who are happily chatting and laughing with each other. She usually cooks at home, more so during quarantine. Whenever she cooks, I try and offer her help. Sometimes she accepts it and other times she tells me she can handle it herself. A few times, when I was doing assignments while she was cooking, no one helped her and she got mad at the ENTIRE FAMILY for a few days.

She often criticizes our behavior and the behavior of other people outside the family. She talks about how messy my aunt's house is, she talks about how my cousins who are less disciplined but more socially successful than my siblings and I have too much freedom. I've tried confronting her several times about her behavior but every time I do, she gets defensive by crying and saying she tries so hard and brings up every recent mistake or unacceptable behavior I did that she can think of. As a result, nothing get resolved and she continues with her behavior.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My youngest sibling has always had an attitude problem since young. He was quite spoiled by our parents, I would say a lot more than his older two siblings. Since young, he had a PS2, PS3, PSP, laptop and smart phone and has developed an addiction to electronic devices. All throughout the day, he will play with either of these devices at home or when we go out. Once when we were on vacation, all his devices were taken away from him because he his addiction was so bad and he started throwing a tantrum saying ""I'm so bored!"" repeatedly when our parents were gone. Even when people come over to the house, he is on his devices and almost NEVER talks to any of the guests. Ever since he got his own room, things have gotten worse. He often locks his room door and spends late nights playing some MMO with online people. When he isn't playing with his devices, he sleeps all day and has very bad sleeping habits as a result. He sleeps too much and is almost always in an irritable mood and rolls his eyes whenever he talks to anyone in the immediate family. Whenever he is given chores to do, he often doesn't do it very well to the point that I have to take over and do it properly. Other times, he delays his chores and ends forgetting to do it. If I had to describe his mindset, it would be 'Play first, work later'.

As result of this, my youngest sibling and my mother clash the most. Quarantine has amplified the toxicity between the two of them and things escalated very badly the previous night at the time that I am writing this post. He absolutely refused to eat dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning with everyone else. When I knocked on his door, he did not answer or open the door. I have not seen him for the past 15 hours as of this moment. I do not know if he is alive or dead, in his room or has runaway. My mother, on the other hand, who has always insisted on everyone having our meals together no longer bothers with this.

My father has devoted his entire personality and time to his work. I've had a few casual conversations with my father to bond with him but our relationship still feels a bit distant. I'm planning to talk to my other sibling about how things are in the family. My other sibling is the only one in the family that I've ever had pleasant memories with. We grew up playing the same toys and I always feel comfortable talking to him because he always listens and never judges me. I often do my best to return his kindness.

Please everyone. I am at a loss of what to do. My family has always had cracks in it but this past year during quarantine, everything has fallen apart. I want to make things better but it seems there is nothing left to hope for. My mental health is taking a toll as a result.

Throughout my time with her, I have seen her go through at least two phases: her less religious phase and her current more religious phase. During her less religious phase which overlaps with the time she was working, she would often micro-manage my studies to such an extent that she would expect me to study a set number of hours a day which was about 6 hours a day for different subjects and fill in those hours in a book that she would check every night. If I did not fulfill those 6 hours, the remaining time would be carried over the next day. She eventually dropped that system. When she became more religious, she started expecting the entire family to take part in a number of religious rituals like sprinkling salted water around the house while reciting holy text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing consistent about her is that she has always practiced a very strict form of parenting. She used to expect us to maintain our grades high and she would dictate the way we dressed and our haircuts. She has friends from teenage years. In comparison to my siblings and I, her friends&amp;#39; children are a lot more successful than her children. Some of those friends&amp;#39; children have extremely impressive career resumes, some have their own businesses, some are very talented and some are just very sociable that you can&amp;#39;t help but like them. My siblings and I are nothing compared to them. Whenever I get into an argument with her, she would keep a cold shoulder to the entire immediate family. When she and I finally sit down to resolve the argument, she always manages to manipulate the situation where she comes out the victim and the winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other day, she has mood swings that are unpredictable. Sometimes she&amp;#39;s talkative and sometimes she&amp;#39;s moody and when she&amp;#39;s moody, she&amp;#39;s very moody. When she&amp;#39;s moody, she&amp;#39;s like that for several days and spreads her moodiness to everyone in the immediate family. She&amp;#39;s like that even to my father who works so hard and is always soft-spoken and kind to her. When I was younger, she would expect her children to always sit down and almost never talk during meals. As a result, every time my family goes out to eat, we almost NEVER talk at the table in the restaurant. I look around and envy other groups in the restaurant who are happily chatting and laughing with each other. She usually cooks at home, more so during quarantine. Whenever she cooks, I try and offer her help. Sometimes she accepts it and other times she tells me she can handle it herself. A few times, when I was doing assignments while she was cooking, no one helped her and she got mad at the ENTIRE FAMILY for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She often criticizes our behavior and the behavior of other people outside the family. She talks about how messy my aunt&amp;#39;s house is, she talks about how my cousins who are less disciplined but more socially successful than my siblings and I have too much freedom. I&amp;#39;ve tried confronting her several times about her behavior but every time I do, she gets defensive by crying and saying she tries so hard and brings up every recent mistake or unacceptable behavior I did that she can think of. As a result, nothing get resolved and she continues with her behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My youngest sibling has always had an attitude problem since young. He was quite spoiled by our parents, I would say a lot more than his older two siblings. Since young, he had a PS2, PS3, PSP, laptop and smart phone and has developed an addiction to electronic devices. All throughout the day, he will play with either of these devices at home or when we go out. Once when we were on vacation, all his devices were taken away from him because he his addiction was so bad and he started throwing a tantrum saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so bored!&amp;quot; repeatedly when our parents were gone. Even when people come over to the house, he is on his devices and almost NEVER talks to any of the guests. Ever since he got his own room, things have gotten worse. He often locks his room door and spends late nights playing some MMO with online people. When he isn&amp;#39;t playing with his devices, he sleeps all day and has very bad sleeping habits as a result. He sleeps too much and is almost always in an irritable mood and rolls his eyes whenever he talks to anyone in the immediate family. Whenever he is given chores to do, he often doesn&amp;#39;t do it very well to the point that I have to take over and do it properly. Other times, he delays his chores and ends forgetting to do it. If I had to describe his mindset, it would be &amp;#39;Play first, work later&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As result of this, my youngest sibling and my mother clash the most. Quarantine has amplified the toxicity between the two of them and things escalated very badly the previous night at the time that I am writing this post. He absolutely refused to eat dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning with everyone else. When I knocked on his door, he did not answer or open the door. I have not seen him for the past 15 hours as of this moment. I do not know if he is alive or dead, in his room or has runaway. My mother, on the other hand, who has always insisted on everyone having our meals together no longer bothers with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father has devoted his entire personality and time to his work. I&amp;#39;ve had a few casual conversations with my father to bond with him but our relationship still feels a bit distant. I&amp;#39;m planning to talk to my other sibling about how things are in the family. My other sibling is the only one in the family that I&amp;#39;ve ever had pleasant memories with. We grew up playing the same toys and I always feel comfortable talking to him because he always listens and never judges me. I often do my best to return his kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please everyone. I am at a loss of what to do. My family has always had cracks in it but this past year during quarantine, everything has fallen apart. I want to make things better but it seems there is nothing left to hope for. My mental health is taking a toll as a result. If you&amp;#39;ve read this far, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So my psychiatrist recently put me on 2mg Abilify to augment my regimen of Wellbutrin 300mg. I understand this is a pretty low dose, but I've only taken one dose as of this morning, and want to stop. My leg is already a little restless naturally, and got a little more so, but didn't really bother me. 

What did, however, is the brain fog I've been feeling all day. I've been able to function fine, do my schoolwork, be alert on the road, etc., and on the plus side my mood feels a bit more stable, but, I've just felt this kind of ""haze"" all day, which I might compare to a very light dose of THC, for those who partake. 

I've been reading the side effects as well, and they kinda spooked me out. It doesn't help that I've had a resting heart reate of ~80 since the early afternoon, and bit ago, I was sitting and doing work, , when my heart rate shot up to 210 bpm, and then went back down to 90 in the span of 2 minutes! (I have a smart watch that monitors)

I was a little worried about some stuff earlier, but I kinda forgot about it, so not sure if it was anxiety. I've never experienced that, though. I'm also starting to get some very light tremors. 


The thing that scares me the most is the weight gain. I've been overweight for a long time, and I've fought so hard to make the weight loss progress I have. I don't know if the wellbutrin will cancel out the effects, but I keep reading anecdotes about how even eating healthy at a deficit and exercise doesn't prevent weight gain. I don't want to fuck it all up now.

Or, at least, I was... I was working part-time (retail, yuck!) and going to college full-time last semester and it broke me. I ended up taking this semester off in an agreement with my parents that they'd get me to see a therapist so I could get better before returning to classes.

I can't even call in my med refills (I run out tomorrow and I'm just stuck unable to do anything) or do laundry or keep up with my hobbies and friends.

Like, in a ""what's the point of that when I'm already pretty much dead"" way. It's like some sort of intense, long-lasting dissociation. I don't know.

It scares me, a lot. It's so different to how depression felt before... And I can't even think of any specific event that caused this shut-down. It feels like it just faded in, gradually crushing me.

Is this maybe just a ""NEW LEVEL UNLOCKED!: EVEN WORSE DEPRESSION"" or could this be something else? I've recently begun thinking about possible CPTSD from emotional toxicity/abuse from my family, but I've been dealing with that my whole life, why would it make me shut down now?

I&amp;#39;m completely shut off in a way I never have been before. I can&amp;#39;t even call in my med refills (I run out tomorrow and I&amp;#39;m just stuck unable to do anything) or do laundry or keep up with my hobbies and friends. In the past, I&amp;#39;ve managed to catch up with things thanks to anxiety&amp;#39;s adrenaline rush, but now I&amp;#39;m not even feeling the anxiety adrenaline. I feel as dead as someone can be while still breathing... I&amp;#39;ve hit low points in life, I&amp;#39;ve been su*cidal before, I&amp;#39;ve self-harmed before.... but now I feel almost past that, and not in a good way. Like, in a &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the point of that when I&amp;#39;m already pretty much dead&amp;quot; way. It&amp;#39;s like some sort of intense, long-lasting dissociation. I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It scares me, a lot. It&amp;#39;s so different to how depression felt before... And I can&amp;#39;t even think of any specific event that caused this shut-down. It feels like it just faded in, gradually crushing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this maybe just a &amp;quot;NEW LEVEL UNLOCKED!: EVEN WORSE DEPRESSION&amp;quot; or could this be something else? I&amp;#39;ve recently begun thinking about possible CPTSD from emotional toxicity/abuse from my family, but I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with that my whole life, why would it make me shut down now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone else relate to this?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I don't know what to do anymore with my life. I feel so lost and have no sense of direction. I'm 23 with no education because I sort of failed high school or I'll didn't fully complete it. Been trying to work to make ends meet but had a horrible time with that because my whole fucking life I been sheltered from the world to the point now I just don't know how to operate as an adult. I feel like I failed my mother who sometimes it sometimes feels embarrassed I'm even her son it seems. 

Any friendships that came into my life has gone because I either never stayed in touched or moved away. Friendships that had the potential of being long lasting I assumed but because of my lack of determination, charisma and interests, it never works out. So that's why I just stay to myself due to feeling like a burden and a problem to everyone. 

All my siblings are older than me so I never had anybody my age to be around except for places like school and work but like I typed before, it never worked out. I mean damn, I really feel like I'm not shit and will never be shit in this life. 

I try to think better of myself when I do accomplish things but I'm just fixated on all the negative shit that has happened and that is currently happening to where I can't see beyond it. It's like my mind is consumed by negativity and it bums me out. 

I know it sounds like I'm victimizing myself but that's alright. I'm aware that everything in my life up until this point at 23 years old is a product of my own choices in life. I can't blame anyone else because it's no one else's fault that I feel this way. I just suck at being human I guess lol. 

So with all that going on within my consciousness, suicide has been a ongoing reoccurring theme in my mind. I think about whether life would be easier without me in the picture since nobody would have to be bothered trying to coach me into adult life at 23. I feel like I would be better off dead than going through life a lost and annoying piece of shit who just makes things worse for everybody. A true parasite indeed.

I feel so lost and have no sense of direction. I&amp;#39;m 23 with no education because I sort of failed high school or I&amp;#39;ll didn&amp;#39;t fully complete it. Been trying to work to make ends meet but had a horrible time with that because my whole fucking life I been sheltered from the world to the point now I just don&amp;#39;t know how to operate as an adult. I feel like I failed my mother who sometimes it sometimes feels embarrassed I&amp;#39;m even her son it seems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any friendships that came into my life has gone because I either never stayed in touched or moved away. Friendships that had the potential of being long lasting I assumed but because of my lack of determination, charisma and interests, it never works out. So that&amp;#39;s why I just stay to myself due to feeling like a burden and a problem to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my siblings are older than me so I never had anybody my age to be around except for places like school and work but like I typed before, it never worked out. I mean damn, I really feel like I&amp;#39;m not shit and will never be shit in this life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to think better of myself when I do accomplish things but I&amp;#39;m just fixated on all the negative shit that has happened and that is currently happening to where I can&amp;#39;t see beyond it. It&amp;#39;s like my mind is consumed by negativity and it bums me out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds like I&amp;#39;m victimizing myself but that&amp;#39;s alright. I&amp;#39;m aware that everything in my life up until this point at 23 years old is a product of my own choices in life. I can&amp;#39;t blame anyone else because it&amp;#39;s no one else&amp;#39;s fault that I feel this way. I just suck at being human I guess lol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with all that going on within my consciousness, suicide has been a ongoing reoccurring theme in my mind. I think about whether life would be easier without me in the picture since nobody would have to be bothered trying to coach me into adult life at 23. I feel like I would be better off dead than going through life a lost and annoying piece of shit who just makes things worse for everybody. A true parasite indeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at those my age and see them with houses, successful careers, and all the hard work they put in to get to where they are now. I wish I was that independent and sure of myself at this age. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I(14f) can't take this anymore to be completely honest. I have to get it all down and out of my head. I don't know what to do about any of this. I'm still coming to terms with it. *sigh* 

Okay. My name (or online alias) is Rue. So, all of the events that I'm about to tell you about happened from ages 4-10. I don't remember when each thing happened so I do apologize for that. 

When I was younger I had this group of friends. They're all much older than me. Each of em' being 5 or 6 years older than me so as of now they're all 19 or 20. I'm going to be calling them BAS. I would use their names but I won't out of fear someone I know may see this and do something to them. And before i get into the story, yes, they're all girls. 

So, BAS. They were really my only friends throughout my childhood, I was bullied a lot in elementary school and Im the youngest of 5 so my siblings never really hung out with me much. BAS were my friends. I like to think so anyways. At first they did abandon me quite a bit. They would make me stay at the top of the street while they all went off and hung out. I remember sitting at the top of the street on my bike with our home phone waiting for them to tell me when to come down. They never did until they came back up and went home. 

Let it be know that I do still deeply care for and love each one of these girls. I know I probably shouldn't, but they were still there for me when no one else was, even if they were still horrible to me. They helped me survive my childhood while also making it worse for me in the future. I have mixed feelings about it all if you can't tell. 

My home life wasn't the best (I don't feel like getting into it too much so just trust me or look at some of my other posts if you'd like) and so I was more often than not hanging out with BAS. 

So. Here goes everything. The part I've been locking up in my mind for so very long. It's been slowly draining me and eating away at the little will to live I have left. 

They rape me. 

It all starts with a blanket fort and some good old fashioned truth or dare. 

Harmless? Right.. 

Well, no. I'm gonna tell you what I remember, and I'm not sure that I remember it all but I'm honestly sorry if you have read this far and are going to continue on because it gets bad for little 4-10 year old Rue from here on out. 

The first thing about truth or dare I remember was the rules. After 2 truths you HAD to pick a dare or else you had to do the punishment (it was probably something stupid like lick a toilet seat or something I dunno) and so I always followed their rules. Keep in mind I also wanted to impress them cause they were older and cool and I wanted to be accepted as their friend. I remember this dare. ""I dare you to eat me out."" Now at the time I had no clue what that was so they showed me by eating me out and then had me do the same. I ate the one who dared me out, A. I dont remember a lot from it..thinking about it makes me kinda sick cause I viewed them as my sisters. And this one happened in our little blanket fort. Parts of me will probably never trust blanket forts again heh.. 

The next thing I remember was the group masturbation. It was probably also cause of a dare but I dont remember. I remember them taking me to the bathroom with them (none of this takes place at my house or when any adult is anywhere around) and them taking their pants and underwear off, telling me to do the same. I did as I was told. I remember not knowing what was happening and then them shoving a uh, a plunger inside me (hurt a lot) and kind of, uhm, ig, raping me with it...then they told me to keep doing it to myself and I did as I was told even though it hurt. They were masturbating and moaning. They never turned the lights on. I can't imagine seeing their faces after they did something like that to me.. 

The third thing I remember. I dont remember very much from this. But A had a dog and BAS kept daring me to suck his dick. I don't recall ever doing it but I remember how much pressure they put on me to do it.. 

And the final thing I remember....
Probably one of the hardest things to remember.. 

BAS tried to get me to suck my brothers dick. 
My brother was also friends with BAS (he had/has no idea what BAS did to me) and they were playing truth or dare. My brother didn't know I was there. They blindfolded him and put earmuffs on his head so he had no idea what was happening. He unzipped his pants and they pulled out his dick..horrifying...then they started forcing my head down, trying to make me give my own brother a blow job....I broke free and ran away, I ran to the park and just cried for a while. My brother still has no idea that this happened to me and I have no idea what happened after I left... 

BAS did a lot to me...but they were intertwined with my entire family. Everyone in my family knew/knows them and all still love them dearly. I'm unsure of how to proceed with all of this constantly bouncing around in my head..it's hard to handle. Some people say I should press charges but I know it'd be too late. I love BAS anyways and dont know if I could ever face them while bringing this up. 

almost all of you encouraged me to speak out to my family or trusted adult and/or go to the police and go to court with them. 

Now, I'm not saying reporting them hasn't crossed my mind because it definitely has, however, you must take into account the logicality of it all. The incidents that I talked about all happened four or more years ago. That's a pretty long time to not only not report it but to also be unbothered by it. Up until recently (this summer and on) I hadn't even thought about BAS or what they did to me. It rarely crossed my mind and when it did I just saw it as childhood memories. Nothing more, nothing less. 

While doing this may have helped me in that short period of time that nothing was happening with BAS it's caused me to only just now realize the horrors I've endured. It can be hard to grasp the full gravity of the situation, for me anyways. I'm sure for people on the outside looking in it's rather simple to see how awful what they did was and what to do about it. 

So let me tell you this... 

This is by no means an easy task. Not in the slightest. I don't know if you realize this but I suffer from severe depression, social anxiety, schizophrenia, insomnia, self injurious behaviours, and suicidal ideations. I'm a freshman in high school and online school has made it incredibly difficult for me to learn much of anything. I've also been in and out of the mental hospital three times this past year; The most recent time if me being admitted was the 18th of January. 

Keeping all of this in mind, let me continue. 

I grew up with BAS. I've known them since I was born and have only not been in contact with them for 4ish years. I grew up with these girls, shared experiences, endured pain, laughed, cried, screamed, hugged, and loved them all. Each and every one of these three girls still holds a deep place in my heart. I hold them close to me. I appreciate the good memories and am just now starting to work through the bad. The way I see it, there's no such thing as a bad person. Though people do bad things and make bad decisions, I still see them as good people. Now, that doesn't mean I'll keep those hurtful people in my life because at this point I've learned not to. People grow and change for the better. These 3 girls each had pretty hard home lives, some more than others. That doesn't excuse what they did to me but it's easier to understand their point of view for me seen as I know what it was like for them all. 

I love them. I've tried to hate them, I've wanted to hate them. I just have no room for hate in my life and I genuinely can't hate BAS. 

So keep in mind that while I was growing up with these girls, the rest of my family was too. My mother, father, grandmas, brother, and sister all knew these girls since they were born. While me, my other brother, and my other sister all knew them since we were born. My family loved these girls (some more than others granted) and saw them as a part of the family. 

Now imagine having children and finding out that three of them raped your youngest daughter. 

Do you realize how heart breaking that would be? How empty and numb you would feel. How angry and naive and just overwhelmingly paralyzed you'd be. You'd be heart broken and empty.. 

I can't do that to my family. I've seen that look in each one of my family members eyes and heard their voices breaking (when I first got caught cutting myself). I swore to myself I'd never make them feel that way again. 

I dont know what to do exactly. Dealing with such a situation is delicate and very emotionally exhausting. 

I'd like to bring these girls to justice if I knew that it'd go the way I'd plan it to. But I have no proof of any of this happening, nor do I have witnesses. It's simply my word against theirs. 

I see no point in ruining these girls' lives along with my own family. I can't afford pressing charges and it probably wouldn't work anyways. 

I fear they may do this to other innocent people but I don't think they would.. 

I'm aware I could always be wrong but is the risk worth the reward? 

I wonder if it was my fault. Was it something I said or did? How strange to never know the truth. These thoughts keep coming no matter how hard I try to keep them out. Would it have all stopped if I had simply said no? Or was there no changing what happened. How could I have avoided such a thing? Being raped. Repeatedly. For years. By the people I loved, trusted, and saw as family. How does a person get over something like that? What did I do to spark the idea in their head? Was it the clothes? The way I talked? The way I walked? How i admired them? How badly I wanted them to accept me? How naive I was. What did i do to deserve it. How did i make them do such a thing? Why did I let them do such a thing.. How did I tempt them to rape me..? Simply how. I could've said no, yet I didn't; This begs the question: Was it not rape because I asked for it by not saying no..? 
The answer?

I love BAS anyways and dont know if I could ever face them while bringing this up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;almost all of you encouraged me to speak out to my family or trusted adult and/or go to the police and go to court with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not saying reporting them hasn&amp;#39;t crossed my mind because it definitely has, however, you must take into account the logicality of it all. The incidents that I talked about all happened four or more years ago. That&amp;#39;s a pretty long time to not only not report it but to also be unbothered by it. Up until recently (this summer and on) I hadn&amp;#39;t even thought about BAS or what they did to me. It rarely crossed my mind and when it did I just saw it as childhood memories. Nothing more, nothing less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing this may have helped me in that short period of time that nothing was happening with BAS it&amp;#39;s caused me to only just now realize the horrors I&amp;#39;ve endured. It can be hard to grasp the full gravity of the situation, for me anyways. I&amp;#39;m sure for people on the outside looking in it&amp;#39;s rather simple to see how awful what they did was and what to do about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me tell you this... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an easy task. Not in the slightest. I don&amp;#39;t know if you realize this but I suffer from severe depression, social anxiety, schizophrenia, insomnia, self injurious behaviours, and suicidal ideations. I&amp;#39;m a freshman in high school and online school has made it incredibly difficult for me to learn much of anything. I&amp;#39;ve also been in and out of the mental hospital three times this past year; The most recent time if me being admitted was the 18th of January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping all of this in mind, let me continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with BAS. I&amp;#39;ve known them since I was born and have only not been in contact with them for 4ish years. I grew up with these girls, shared experiences, endured pain, laughed, cried, screamed, hugged, and loved them all. Each and every one of these three girls still holds a deep place in my heart. I hold them close to me. I appreciate the good memories and am just now starting to work through the bad. The way I see it, there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a bad person. Though people do bad things and make bad decisions, I still see them as good people. Now, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;ll keep those hurtful people in my life because at this point I&amp;#39;ve learned not to. People grow and change for the better. These 3 girls each had pretty hard home lives, some more than others. That doesn&amp;#39;t excuse what they did to me but it&amp;#39;s easier to understand their point of view for me seen as I know what it was like for them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love them. I&amp;#39;ve tried to hate them, I&amp;#39;ve wanted to hate them. I just have no room for hate in my life and I genuinely can&amp;#39;t hate BAS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind that while I was growing up with these girls, the rest of my family was too. My mother, father, grandmas, brother, and sister all knew these girls since they were born. While me, my other brother, and my other sister all knew them since we were born. My family loved these girls (some more than others granted) and saw them as a part of the family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine having children and finding out that three of them raped your youngest daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you realize how heart breaking that would be? How empty and numb you would feel. How angry and naive and just overwhelmingly paralyzed you&amp;#39;d be. You&amp;#39;d be heart broken and empty.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t do that to my family. I&amp;#39;ve seen that look in each one of my family members eyes and heard their voices breaking (when I first got caught cutting myself). I swore to myself I&amp;#39;d never make them feel that way again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know what to do exactly. Dealing with such a situation is delicate and very emotionally exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to bring these girls to justice if I knew that it&amp;#39;d go the way I&amp;#39;d plan it to. But I have no proof of any of this happening, nor do I have witnesses. It&amp;#39;s simply my word against theirs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no point in ruining these girls&amp;#39; lives along with my own family. I can&amp;#39;t afford pressing charges and it probably wouldn&amp;#39;t work anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear they may do this to other innocent people but I don&amp;#39;t think they would.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware I could always be wrong but is the risk worth the reward? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it was my fault. Was it something I said or did? How strange to never know the truth. These thoughts keep coming no matter how hard I try to keep them out. Would it have all stopped if I had simply said no? Or was there no changing what happened. How could I have avoided such a thing? Being raped. Repeatedly. For years. By the people I loved, trusted, and saw as family. How does a person get over something like that? What did I do to spark the idea in their head? Was it the clothes? The way I talked? The way I walked? How i admired them? How badly I wanted them to accept me? How naive I was. What did i do to deserve it. How did i make them do such a thing? Why did I let them do such a thing.. How did I tempt them to rape me..? Simply how. I could&amp;#39;ve said no, yet I didn&amp;#39;t; This begs the question: Was it not rape because I asked for it by not saying no..? 
The answer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have BPD and it can lead to obsessing over specific people. There's this person (Mark Davis) I've been fixated on since around 2015. It's like when I saw him, there was this INSTANT interest/bond.

Ever since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, everything, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.

Just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. I just love how dorky he is, I think he's absolutely adorable and he's always so lively..

I haven't met him in person yet, but I hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times.

But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real.

He comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now.

I've had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. Even now when I'm imagining him dying I literally feel physically sick to my stomach. I feel like if he died I'd have a nervous breakdown and I feel like crying right now just because I'm having to even bring that up.

Problem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not.

Looking back on school reports, even from the young age of 5, the teachers always commented on how reserved/quiet I was and that ""I needed to ask more questions in class if he wants to get good grades"".

He has been asked if he wants to continue living and he adamantly gave a thumbs up, so it's a relief he's not giving up, he's always been the strongest person I've known and bounced back from every injury in the past, so it's amazing to know he still has that drive left. Regardless of all of his efforts, there have been setbacks after setbacks, and because of the pandemic I've not been able to visit him, and have been limited to infrequent Skype sessions with him.  There isn't a day where I don't think and cry about him.

I have to smoke weed everyday to stop me from spiraling into a long crying session or depressed days which would otherwise affect my ability to do my job.  I don't  contemplate suicide and I've told my mother all about everything I've mentioned and assured her I would never do something, my goal in life is to own a successful game studio so until then I'm too stubborn to quit :) My Mother is better than any mother I could ever ask for, I feel incredibly sad for my mum's situation but she's doing the best she can and I'm always here for her.

People will tell you you’re not alone when you say you have depression 

They’ll tell you everybody gets sad sometimes 

They say: 

“Take a walk, get some fresh air”

“Put your phone away and have a picnic”

“Read a book in the bath, have a night of self-care”

But what do you do when you’ve tried it all and nothing did the trick?

I’ve bought all the best bath bombs, sugar scrubs and body washes they make

I maxed out my library card and filled bookshelves with every adventure book google could suggest 

I got a puppy and a kitten and friends and a relationship, even after heartbreak

I ate veggies on a picnic blanket in the sun as the breeze sunk pollen filled breaths into my chest

I drove with the windows down, AC blaring more than my radio and sang songs off key at sun-down

I found beauty in the world around me

I took photos of my favorite sunsets, wrote journals full of my days, cataloging every little detail I love about my town 

I made plans with friends and laughed and cried into the night, completely care free 

I found new shows to binge and new movies to love and new songs to sing in the shower 

I drank water and cut out my favorite guilty pleasure foods, I even emptied my snack drawer 

I walked and hiked and swam and ran in a field of wildflowers 

I bought new clothes, new bedding, a new phone case, new room decor

I moved my bed, I changed my Pinterest boards to track my progress

I went thrifting, I painted art, I celebrated 

I cried, I screamed into the black night, I was hopeless 

I tried everything they told me, I read every buzzfeed article and watched every YouTube video that related 

I loved myself, I gave myself passes, I treated myself with respect and understanding

,depression,"I don’t know if all this is going to belong on this subreddit but I literally don’t know what else to do anymore.

So to set the stage I guess I’ll explain a little about myself:
I’m a 26 year old male, currently no permanent job, no real hobbies unless you include watching youtube, watching anime and playing video games (which is about every day of my life so I don’t count them). I don’t really have any ambition or goal I want to work toward in my life. I have no talents whatsoever, believe me, I’ve tried doing just about everything. I’m not very smart either, it takes a lot for even basic concepts to sink in. I also have pretty severe self image issues, I hate literally everything about myself; my appearance, my voice, my name, my attitude, everything. I’m a shut-in who goes outside at most once a fortnight. Ironically, despite being a shut-in I hate the house I’m living in. There’s no room for anything and it constantly feels cramped. It takes a lot to not want to set this sorry excuse for a house on fire, or punch holes in the goddamn walls. I have no real friends in my life that I can hang out with. I live with just my mum at home. I have Aspergers and ADHD so communicating with people, especially those I have never met before, a real challenge for me. This also makes phone calls extremely difficult. I can never call someone and only answer a call if I know it’s coming beforehand. Lastly, I have virtually no life skills so I’m basically forced to leech off of others like a parasite. (If anything else is needed I’ll edit it in later) 

Before I continue I just want to say, while I do feel like I would be better off dead, or even better, having never existed at all, I have no desire to kill myself even if thoughts of suicide swirl around in my brain. “If I just drive full speed into oncoming traffic...”, “I could just swallow this whole bottle of sleeping pills”, shit like that.

I have always been depressed since high school but it feels like it’s getting worse and worse lately. And I know this isn’t due to the current pandemic because I’ve actually been having a relatively great time. I have more money in my bank account than ever before thanks to government payments. And I lost over 20kg (healthily) making me the lightest I’ve been since high school. I think my depression is getting worse because things are actually getting back to normal. Being forced to look for work again has triggered my self-loathing thoughts and heightened my sense of worthlessness again.

I managed to graduate high school but without a single certificate to my name. I hated it. I couldn’t figure out what I wanted back then and I still can’t even 10 years later. No jobs these days hire without experience or qualifications, which makes sense, of course, but after school trying to get those qualifications is a lot more difficult AND expensive. Almost defeats the point of trying.

Sorry if that was an odd tangent, I’m just trying to get my thoughts out there even if they might make this post jumbled.

Anyway, I guess I’ll explain what inspired me to make this post now, despite feeling like this for years now. Yesterday, I received a phone call from a charity I donate to thanking me for my support. It was so scripted I swear I could almost see the guy reading it off his computer screen. Then, he tells me I’m a good person. What? 
(I didn’t mention this above but I am far from a good, decent person. I frequently wish death upon people I dislike simply because I think they shouldn’t exist. I despise people who are wealthy and wish them misfortune out of pure jealousy because I grew up poor, which I still am. I ignore people’s suffering - (including my own mother who has dealt with chronic pain for well over 10 years due to an accident, and I’ve just grown so tired of hearing her moan and complain about it even though I know it’s not her fault) - because they have nothing to do with me. Why should I care about people I don’t know or have ever met? And yes, I am fully aware of the hypocrisy of me posting this cry for help despite not wanting to help others. That’s how selfish and broken I am as a person. “So why?”, you ask. “Why did you start donating to a charity if you don’t care about helping people?” 
Simple. I was out with a friend who flew upstate to come meet and hangout with me and we just happened to be stopped by those people you always see who want you to sign up for shit. And neither of us could just say “no”. I immediately regretted it but still haven’t quit yet because I said I’d give it 2 years.)

So back to that phone call. The moment I heard “good person” I started tearing up. Even now as I type this it’s happening again. What about that previous paragraph makes me a good person?! It took everything I had to keep it together until that call ended, and as soon as it did I just broke down sobbing. Even knowing everything the guy said was scripted, even knowing I’m a rotten person deep down, why do those 2 words hurt me so much?

If you’re thinking it’s because subconsciously I want to be a better person you’re dead wrong. I want nothing more than to continue my selfish, jobless, wasteful life where I consume all the media I want, whenever I want, without a single care in the whole fucking world. I could just do without the depression. Honestly, if I won the lottery that is exactly what I’d do.

Ugh, this post is getting less cohesive now, sorry about that. I’m getting tired of typing because this app is slow as fuck.

I don’t even know what point I’m trying to make anymore.

If this post gets any responses, I’m not expecting anything, but let me save some people some time: No, I’m not going to seek professional help, it should be abundantly clear how anti-social I am. If I was the kind of person who could seek professional help, I’d have done it already instead of posting here.

I don’t think I’ve actually asked for help or advice on anything specific up to this point have I? Truthfully, I don’t even know what to ask. Maybe just general thoughts on me, or tips on how to help my mental state, or maybe telling some stories about yourselves (I don’t know when I’ll read them though).

Last paragraph now, if anyone has actually read everything then thank you. I honestly don’t deserve it. Time is probably the most valuable thing in the universe and you would have wasted yours on a depressed, un-caring, un-motivated, un-ambitious, self-loathing, talentless, skill-less, heartless, selfish, piece of shit like myself.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know what point I’m trying to make anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this post gets any responses, I’m not expecting anything, but let me save some people some time: No, I’m not going to seek professional help, it should be abundantly clear how anti-social I am. If I was the kind of person who could seek professional help, I’d have done it already instead of posting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve actually asked for help or advice on anything specific up to this point have I? Truthfully, I don’t even know what to ask. Maybe just general thoughts on me, or tips on how to help my mental state, or maybe telling some stories about yourselves (I don’t know when I’ll read them though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last paragraph now, if anyone has actually read everything then thank you. I honestly don’t deserve it. Time is probably the most valuable thing in the universe and you would have wasted yours on a depressed, un-caring, un-motivated, un-ambitious, self-loathing, talentless, skill-less, heartless, selfish, piece of shit like myself. You are actually a good person.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This year's been shit, I just can't deal with it anymore. I've tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but it's just gotten too much. 

Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world (that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed), but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldn't feel better, I'd sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what I've been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. 

In retrospect it's probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didn't. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I don't really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after it's been diagnosed, a complete mess. 

Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didn't exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldn't be going out. That's when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my family's health, but eventually I was sent in to school. 

Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. I've always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. 

I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. 

School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly weren't having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didn't feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didn't, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. 

My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didn't really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend (at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didn't listen to my concerns) so I wouldn't be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I don't know why it's just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. 

Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didn't do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. 

These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldn't work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. 

Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety I've ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. 

That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I can't do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started (a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed) and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldn't do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldn't. I didn't think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said that's just life, there's always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldn't cope with that anymore, I couldn't cope with that awful reality. I just didn't enjoy living anymore, and if it's this bad now as only a highschooler I couldn't imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again I'd ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. 

Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT (another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast) in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I don't think that's happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. 

So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I don't want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, I'm so tired of everything, I've been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why won't I feel better? I have a test for my driver's license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life?

,depression,"I don't even know where to start this or why I am even writing this. Excuse the predicted typos and grammatical errors I am typing this at 2 am drunk. I semi apologize in advance for how stupid this all might sound but i am genuinely fucking HURT. I am just lost as - as you know what. Well let's start with 2019- Literally the best year of my life, I had a nice group of friends, i was always going out, i lost a bunch of weight , i was happy, healthy and thriving. It seemed like everyday got better and it did, i ended up meeting my now fiance on a vacation in southern France ( a vacation i worked my ass off for a whole year working min wage to go to) 3 days after coming back in August I landed an amazing job with Chanel ( Literally do not know how i managed that ) &amp; I got accepted to university the same day as getting the new job- me and my dysfunctional ass family were finally good for once i literally had it the fuck all. (i was freshly 19 at the time). I don't know where it all went wrong, i literally do not. It came crumbling fast. The Chanel job was AMAZING, i was surrounded by new social people everyday, I made a bunch of new friends that were my age, everyday was a surprise, something to look forward to- It was the first job I was wholeheartedly was happy about and exited to go to. School started off pretty good too, i was just thriving - best i have ever been in life ( I put that on everything i love) My boss was really type B (type B on crack) she had a son my age and she started out very warm and motherly the first month but then became a micro managing, breathing down your neck, judgmental , always side eyeing YKW. She would always pick on the little things ( me not wearing enough makeup, one strand of hair being out of place, even saw a MAC lipstick in my pouch and shook her head at me) I honestly think in the beginning she was trying to help me, help me succeed with the brand , help me match the image of the company i was working for, etc. I did some stupid shit in the start of my working there, I was fresh back from a 2 month long vacation, newly in love, I was just high on life. The vacation me did not wear off, i was always smiley and chatty , texting my fiance constantly when i shouldn't, etc etc. When she had a conversation with me about that i did a complete 180 and snapped back into reality asap, i was no longer on my phone on the floor, i stayed in my section at all times, i was always on time, my sales were THROUGH THE ROOF, every single day, i was always booking appointments until max capacity, had a clientele within 2 months of working there , made 8 close close friend, the place felt like home, it was my home and safe space. Then January of 2020 things began to fall apart, i was working overtime at Chanel and couldn't keep up with school and ended up withdrawing from school, then my best friend and i ended up having a nasty nasty fight which almost got physical and we stopped being friends and did not talk ( Until now but it's not the same at all) , my boss became passive aggressive towards me, would almost ignore me and i felt uncomfortable af, my District boss was getting multiple multiple ""client complaints about me"" about things that NEVER EVER happened, i genuinely think my boss was filing them anonymously or having her friends do it because i swear on my life that i poured my heart out and gave it my all when it came to the actual work and clients, I ended up being fired the last day of January for another ""customer complaint"" a fake fucking customer complaint. My boss had worked there 14+ years and had a lot of power and sway, i don;t know what i ever did to her. I admit i was immature and high on love and life at first but when she checked me on it i straightened up the same second. After being fired everything went downhill, covid quarantine started, I lost contact with most of my friends, i ended up being kicked out from my house , didn't re-enroll in school( still haven't), gained all the weight back and more, got diagnosed with an physical illness, got put on strong ati anxiety/depression meds that did not work, and did not work for a year exactly due to being in a state that was heavily impacted by Covid. I started working again 2 months ago and things are getting better i guess or though i thought so but i still feel so empty, i feel so lonely and depressed, i see a couple friends here and there but it doens't make a difference on how i feel, it just isn't the same, my fiance and i haven't seen each other in almost 2 years ( will be 2 years in August) because of Covid, I don't think I will be able to see him this summer in person either France is closed off. I am grateful to have a job and make money ( i was in bed crying everyday for a whole hear) but my new job is so fucking miserable, all i do is stare at a computer and everybody is 40 years older than me, every day is the same. Everyday is predictable. I miss my Chanel job so much, i miss having a best friend i would see all the time, i miss the excitement of the beginning of my relationship i miss my fiance flirting with me and being in awe over me ( we've been together a couple years now long distance and it feels like we've been married for 10 years) , i miss the happy beautiful me who had spark in her eyes, my eyes have no life in them now, i don't feel excited about anything, everyday is numb, i don't get pleasure from anything. Nothing to look forward to, even when i make plans i feel nothing, i feel like a part of me or all of me died this last year and a half. I miss the person i used to be i miss my life, I turn 21 this month and i just feel nothingness, is it really just downhill from here ? Am i crazy? What happened? I am back with my parents and i am happy to be around my siblings again, my parents and i's relationship was never good it was mostly abusive and it probably will never be good, i am going to restart school in the fall i hope but i dont know wtf i am going to do - i was planning law and fiance but that just seems like a dreadful career, good money yes but fucking boring. I love my fiance but i wish he would just man up sometimes and take some of the weight off my shoulders at time just like i do for him. I don't know anymore.

,depression,"I can't lose weight. It's so hard and I just can't do it anymore. I've been stuck at my highest weight for months on end not able to lose a pound. I live with my parents and don't have money to buy my own food so I'm subject to all the shitty food they buy and cook. They barely buy fresh fruits and vegetables. It's all meat and processed junk. So I discovered CICO and thought it would work. Nope. I ate 500 calories a day for a week and didn't lose a single pound. I try working out an hour everyday, but everytime my body crashes after 20 minutes and I can't go on. It's hard trying to move around in 162 pound body at 5'1. To make matters worse I have a vacation with all my skinny friends coming up in a couple of weeks and I'm still fucking fat. They never pointed out my weight, but I'm tired of being the fat friend or the silent judgment I feel from their parents when they open the door everytime I come over. Their eyes say, ""How could parents let their child get so big?"" Everyone in my family is obese or overweight. Several have high blood pressure and diabetes on both sides. It's so bad I had to get tested for diabetes at 9 and thankfully it came back negative. I remember the doctor telling my mom bluntly that I was overweight and needed to lose some pounds, but she ignored it and told me they were being mean to me while in the car...I wish she would've listened to them instead of carrying on like usual. She was morbidly obese and had to have weight loss surgery herself when I was a child. She lost a lot of weight and is still far from a healthy weight herself.

I've hated my body since I was in middle school and still do as a sophomore in college. I'll always hate my body and never love it. When I was in highschool I was 130 pounds and hated my body still. Now I would give anything to go back to that weight. Only 2 pair out of 7 pairs of jeans fit. I have to squeeze into my what used to be ""fat safety clothes."" Clothes I would wear if I was feeling fat. Everything fits me horribly now and I just cover it up with a big jacket. I've been depressed the last two years too. I just hate my body so much. I avoid pictures. I scrutinize and pick apart everything I hate about my body in the mirror everyday. I constantly weigh myself to see if I've changed only to be disappointed everytime. I'd never thought I'd get this heavy, but here I am. Everytime I gain weight, I never lose it. Everytime I pack on pounds that's my official new weight. I haven't been able to lose five pounds in three or four years. It's awful. Everyone tells me I'm fine and to love myself, but I don't want to love myself at this weight. I refuse to. I want to be thin and pretty. I want to be more attractive. I feel so fucking disgusting and fucking hate myself. The body positive movement is the worst thing that could've happened to society. Being fat is not okay. It poses health risks and makes you feel shitty about yourself all the time. You're not able to wear cute clothes. You're always worried about how you look and how others perceive you. It's hell and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I'd rather be depressed and skinny than fat and depressed. Trust me, being depressed and fat is way worse than the latter. 

I want to go on vacation and have fun, but the fact I will have to do so in my fat body makes me feel awful. I've lost hope on losing weight and if I did start to lose weight it probably would take me 3-5 years to lose 30 pounds. I'm not ready to dedicate 3-5 years to losing 30 pounds.

I feel the more and more I return to this place to talk, the less and less I have to talk about. This sickness still eats away at my soul and body, but it leaves me nothing in return; it doesn't so much as defecate, only devour. I feel invalid, for having nothing else to talk about, and selfish, for struggling with these problems so long but not having anything to show for it. 

It's the exact same shit, the exact same every single day. There has to be something, some tumour this vile fucking cancer has spawned in my brain that I can identify and scoop out, but it's hiding deep in there. I can't reach it, I can't see it, I have to deal with its side effects and it's the same every day. The continuous waste, the lethargy, the lack of will, the feeling that I'm better off dead. Better off dead for everyone else, and better off dead for myself because I'll never get anywhere.

If anything, I'm the cancer. I suck from my superiors, my parents, my background, my government, my therapist, I suck EVERYONE'S life force away but they just don't see it yet. I take, but I can't give back. I'm just destined to grow and stagnate until they all die, at which point I'll die too. I'm hopeless on my own.

&lt;p&gt;I feel the more and more I return to this place to talk, the less and less I have to talk about. This sickness still eats away at my soul and body, but it leaves me nothing in return; it doesn&amp;#39;t so much as defecate, only devour. I feel invalid, for having nothing else to talk about, and selfish, for struggling with these problems so long but not having anything to show for it. &lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;#39;t reach it, I can&amp;#39;t see it, I have to deal with its side effects and it&amp;#39;s the same every day. The continuous waste, the lethargy, the lack of will, the feeling that I&amp;#39;m better off dead. Better off dead for everyone else, and better off dead for myself because I&amp;#39;ll never get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, I&amp;#39;m the cancer. I suck from my superiors, my parents, my background, my government, my therapist, I suck EVERYONE&amp;#39;S life force away but they just don&amp;#39;t see it yet. I take, but I can&amp;#39;t give back. I&amp;#39;m just destined to grow and stagnate until they all die, at which point I&amp;#39;ll die too. I&amp;#39;m hopeless on my own.

I'm finally in a career position where I feel valued, but it's just not translating over into my life outside of there. Over the weekend I flew home to clear out a storage unit I'd left prior to coming out here. Barely even had the chance to see my family because I had it in my head that I absolutely had to be back here.

I could've spent that time with my family and just left all that stuff there.

Maybe I'm just weepy and miserable from the lack of sleep, but it's making me assess my life and my options at the moment.

I could switch to remote work entirely, but then I'd just be really alone here, and it would limit my upward mobility within the office environment.

I drive them to dr's appointments occasionally, grocery shop, pay my part of the bills with online gig work, consume mindless entertainment/games, do some of my free online course an hour or 2 a day (2 years now), and that's about it. There's some small moments of satisfaction (parent seems thankful even though I don't do much), but I'm just hollowly going through the motions with no dreams or hope of change at this point.

I was in low-income therapy for a good 3 years and tried various meds before dropping it after no improvement.

Tried some meditation and exercise which had very slight benefits. I constantly make stupid mistakes though, and I suck at speaking clearly and holding conversations, let alone getting people to be receptive to attempted jokes or stories (not that I try anymore).

That said, I used to be passably social/normal at first glance with effort, and I had friends (but never a girlfriend).

,depression,"I've been dealing with depression and social anxiety since I was little. My mother was a devout and always raised me as if I was in a box so I didn't know many things, I didn't know what people were talking about. My mother was dressing me, I was acting as my mother said. That's why I started being bullied in 5th grade, by people I was friends with. Because I was making friends so hard, I did all their errands so that i won’t lose them. My teachers pulled me over and always said stop being friends with them, that's how I got rid of them and transferred from that school.

Then my favorite cousin wanted to touch me. He tried to manipulate me to touch me, threatened me, and since he was the only cousin who played with me, I kept my voice again. I still hate myself for that, I wanna kill myself for that. Even tho I know I was a child, I still hate it. Then I suddenly pulled myself out of the whole world. My family was never worried about me, they only wanted to see my old self who did everything they want. Many times I thought of killing myself. Once I hurted myself, then I realized I was afraid of dying.
I started to get rid of my mother's terror and express my own ideas in the 9th grade. My mother took me to the doctor, but I found a reason and left it constantly. At school, my teachers thought I was mute. For the first time in years, I made a new friend. It was difficult for her because I didn't seem willing at all. She’s still my best friend now. I thought I was saved. I slowly started talking to people in the 11th grade. I was still shaking when talking to someone. I was getting off the subway before my own stop just because it was crowded. I thought everyone was laughing at me.

I made a new friend from school again. When they were with me I was able to act outside as if I had no anxiety. I started to feel free. My depression triggering me lessened. This time I thought I really got off. My shaking stopped, I started talking to people online.

,depression,"Not having a great time. I typically manage to obscure (from myself) the fundamental truth that I do not find my life worth living and doubt that I ever will. But today the veil has slipped, as occasionally it does, and so here I am to vent again. 

In short, I have a lack of desire for what life offers, and an excess of aversion for what life offers. Further, much of what I am averse to is rather important and what I desire I am ill equipped to obtain.

Years of isolation have left people increasingly ""unreal"" to me. By this, I mean that basically the only person in my life who I like is my therapist, and I think this is wearing on my capacity for empathy/interest in healthy relationships with others. The idea that I could ever find and sustain romantic love is alternately a distant dream and a cruel joke. Finding and sustaining friendship seems increasingly problematic as well. Indeed it starts to seem like the only sort of benefit I could acquire reliably from people would be self-satisfaction from feeling superior to them. 

This is of course the inverse of what I actually feel, as I regard myself as a failure in essentially every respect. I am simply losing faith, as it were, in the possibility of sustained feelings outside of what regularly comprises the grim emotional realities of my diseased mind. I believe life is cold and shitty, and thus I'm losing the ability to hope for anything other than an inverse of my current self-created hierarchy where everything is still cold and shitty, but at least I'm at the top looking down instead of at the bottom looking up.

This is of course manifestly unhealthy, and terribly unlikely to happen, to boot. Accomplishment requires effort, and I have very little effort I am willing to give. Simply accepting this life is a loss for me and dying frankly seems far more reasonable at times like this.

As always, I am in no danger of actually attempting suicide in the immediate future. Even if my resistance has been slowly dwindling over the years, I am not there yet and have a few concrete ideas for big risks I could plausibly take that might change my life for the better (or...screw it up further) that would at least be worth rolling the dice on if I came to the point that I was seriously at the end of my rope. 

But yes, today is not a good day for me, though my therapist's job security continues to look fantastic.

Days like this I wish I could simply have a new game+ experience with life. Alas, my (tenuously held, I admit) Christian belief system seems to pretty clearly indicate that such a thing is not in the cards. Pity. I have not yet lost hope in human life itself.

&lt;p&gt;Days like this I wish I could simply have a new game+ experience with life. Alas, my (tenuously held, I admit) Christian belief system seems to pretty clearly indicate that such a thing is not in the cards. Pity. I have not yet lost hope in human life itself. I imagine it might actually be pretty great. Just not for me, not this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been unemployed since I graduated in the midst of the first wave of lockdowns. I was so happy and excited to enter workforce and stop scraping by on student allowance/loan, but instead I'm now scraping by on unemployment benefits.

After the first few rejections I figured I just don't have enough experience writing applications, so I read about writing resumes and motivation letters, tweaked my portfolio, thought about what to add and what to remove, just figured I can get it right and keep working on it until something takes. I have the experience from internships the school made mandatory, it's not much but it's something. Slightly above average grades, exemplary letters from internships. The counselors kept going on about how high the employment rate was on our career track.

I've applied to everything I'm even a bit qualified for in the creative fields, but regardless of if it was something I had practical experience of from the internships or if it was a posting that didn't specify that you needed a lot of experience, I've gotten exactly one interview, somehow from the posting I was least qualified for, and didn't make it to the second interview.

What's eating me alive is that I don't know what's wrong. I don't know what I'm missing. Even the jobs welcoming fresh graduates pass me by. At this point I get close to a panic attack seeing openings and have passed a couple without applying because I don't know why I'm not good enough. Every time I try to think of something to make to bolster my portfolio with at least personal projects if not paid ones, I get so anxious I can't get started even picking what to work on. Nothing I do is working. Nothing is good enough.

People tell me to send cold applications to companies who are not advertising openings but my anxiety is so severe that I can't. At least when replying to postings I know what to say and what they are looking for, and even then I don't know why I wasn't even chosen to be interviewed. I have a suspicion it might be because I've never been active on social media because of my lifelong anxiety issues, so my name doesn't really return any results, but it doesn't feel fair either. I have samples of my work and the paperwork from school and the internships. Putting myself out there just gets harder the more I try.

I don't know what to do at this point, I'm burnt out and thinking about working on anything creative forms a lump in my throat. But after spending days, weeks avoiding job sites and work I then feel like a lazy piece of shit, it's my own fault no one hires me if I can't get better. Every piece or project I create feels worse than the last. I can't even call myself a fresh graduate anymore after a year of unemployment. The longer the gap the worse it looks. But if I need work experience to get work experience, what am I supposed to do? I can't afford to go back to school nor do I want to change career track before even starting the one I already worked so hard for to get a degree in. 

I just want to give up.

I was so happy and excited to enter workforce and stop scraping by on student allowance/loan, but instead I&amp;#39;m now scraping by on unemployment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first few rejections I figured I just don&amp;#39;t have enough experience writing applications, so I read about writing resumes and motivation letters, tweaked my portfolio, thought about what to add and what to remove, just figured I can get it right and keep working on it until something takes. I have the experience from internships the school made mandatory, it&amp;#39;s not much but it&amp;#39;s something. Slightly above average grades, exemplary letters from internships. The counselors kept going on about how high the employment rate was on our career track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve applied to everything I&amp;#39;m even a bit qualified for in the creative fields, but regardless of if it was something I had practical experience of from the internships or if it was a posting that didn&amp;#39;t specify that you needed a lot of experience, I&amp;#39;ve gotten exactly one interview, somehow from the posting I was least qualified for, and didn&amp;#39;t make it to the second interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s eating me alive is that I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong. I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m missing. Even the jobs welcoming fresh graduates pass me by. At this point I get close to a panic attack seeing openings and have passed a couple without applying because I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m not good enough. Every time I try to think of something to make to bolster my portfolio with at least personal projects if not paid ones, I get so anxious I can&amp;#39;t get started even picking what to work on. Nothing I do is working. Nothing is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tell me to send cold applications to companies who are not advertising openings but my anxiety is so severe that I can&amp;#39;t. At least when replying to postings I know what to say and what they are looking for, and even then I don&amp;#39;t know why I wasn&amp;#39;t even chosen to be interviewed. I have a suspicion it might be because I&amp;#39;ve never been active on social media because of my lifelong anxiety issues, so my name doesn&amp;#39;t really return any results, but it doesn&amp;#39;t feel fair either. I have samples of my work and the paperwork from school and the internships. Putting myself out there just gets harder the more I try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this point, I&amp;#39;m burnt out and thinking about working on anything creative forms a lump in my throat. But after spending days, weeks avoiding job sites and work I then feel like a lazy piece of shit, it&amp;#39;s my own fault no one hires me if I can&amp;#39;t get better. Every piece or project I create feels worse than the last. I can&amp;#39;t even call myself a fresh graduate anymore after a year of unemployment. The longer the gap the worse it looks. But if I need work experience to get work experience, what am I supposed to do?

,depression,"Hey all,

Some context, I was not a very sociable person in high school. I didn’t have many friends, but still felt a desire to be part of a group and to “fit in”. Myself and my best friend (who I love like a brother and we are still friends to this day) used to hang out with a group of guys, who I will say, weren’t really the nicest bunch. I hung out with one of them in class and found him funny, but then the relationship changed and I realized he was quite toxic and abusive. 

One day we hung out at my place when they decided to screw around. My parents weren’t home and they wrestled me and stuck my head in a toilet. 

I didn’t realize they filmed it and uploaded it on the internet. The funny thing is, the act itself didn’t traumatize me, it was the relentless teasing I received afterwards. People taunted and teased me almost everyday. They believed that I “volunteered to do it” and that I was “disgusting” and “had AIDS”. They would ask me “Why did you do it” and refuse to listen if I insisted that I was forced. I weirdly find myself believing this up til today, even though I know better.

There was this one guy who I was in a few classes with. He was popular and well-liked among everyone, he also wasn’t the WORST to me compared to others. Just the usual “why did you do it” as established earlier, and the odd bit of condescending remarks here and there. He’s now in my country, established himself as a podcaster and comedian, with a bit of a following and he’s also chummy with a few bigger stars now.

I at least managed to forget about all until the other day when I got thinking about this comedian, and decided to try listening to one of his podcasts. He ended up touching on high school, and told these other guys about me and the group I was in. He went on about how we’d “give each other swirlies” and how we “bullied each other only” and how everyone else in high school were all good to each other. 

I don’t know why, but hearing all this made my stomach sick and I can’t help but think about it for the last few days. It’s a total lie, he has NO IDEA what I went through, stuff which he joined in on.

,depression,"Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to use people for my own enjoyment.

I don't want to work for mysterious goals I don't understand.

I don't want to be happy about being the universe's plaything.

I don't want to get a high from having strength enough to do their dirty work and some drug's making me give them my smile so they can laugh at me enjoying it.

I don't want to talk like happy people do when they ignore what life can be and how everything we regard as good is the source of everything bad.

I don't want to feel desperate about life when it's only going to be more painful.

I don't want to join the team that has helped me feel this bad.

I don't want to have gone through this all just to become the lowest of the low in the happy hierarchy.

I don't want to be able to start a family and gamble with lives.

I don't want to worship the indifference.

I don't want to become all high and mighty.

I don't want to like drugs.

,depression,"Reddit is one of the best things that ever happened to me. I've always been an insecure lonely only child throughout my life because of various reasons, but reddit is the only place I've ever been able to truly open up and try to release all the morbid thoughts and stuff I have bottled up.
But nowadays, I seem to not be able to do that too. I feel like crying everyday at totally random moments nowadays, and hardly speak more than 500 odd words a day. Im starting to see morbidity in everything around me and given I'm already at rock bottom rn in my personal life because of various reasons, all these are just adding up. I'm going to sleep at 6am everyday coz I just end up staring at the ceiling all day long. 

And I don't even have the energy or will to post them on reddit anymore. I want to get so many thoughts of my chest but I can't seem to even articulate any of it nowadays or gather the will nd strength to post it.

And that's breaking me even more. Posting on reddit was the one small thing that used to give me joy nd a sense of a safety net, but even that's proving way too hard for me.

I&amp;#39;ve always been an insecure lonely only child throughout my life because of various reasons, but reddit is the only place I&amp;#39;ve ever been able to truly open up and try to release all the morbid thoughts and stuff I have bottled up.
But nowadays, I seem to not be able to do that too. I feel like crying everyday at totally random moments nowadays, and hardly speak more than 500 odd words a day. Im starting to see morbidity in everything around me and given I&amp;#39;m already at rock bottom rn in my personal life because of various reasons, all these are just adding up. I&amp;#39;m going to sleep at 6am everyday coz I just end up staring at the ceiling all day long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t even have the energy or will to post them on reddit anymore. I want to get so many thoughts of my chest but I can&amp;#39;t seem to even articulate any of it nowadays or gather the will nd strength to post it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s breaking me even more. Posting on reddit was the one small thing that used to give me joy nd a sense of a safety net, but even that&amp;#39;s proving way too hard for me.

,depression,"Hello, my name’s Brandon. (21 M) I was born with a profound hearing loss. My father was both verbally and physically abusive. I was raised by a single mother my whole life, I have three other siblings, two of them are my half siblings and I see them only around the holidays once a year. My other sibling is my sister, she has autism and hearing loss as well. We don’t really have anything in common, she moved out of the house two years ago and now has a kid. It’s just me and my mom now. 

I grew up with kids who had hearing loss just like me and I went to school with them my whole life. In middle school I transferred over to a mainstream school with a bunch of other kids who were considered as “normal” or had regular hearing. I struggled making friends growing up, I took special education classes my whole life, I excelled in all of them but once I got to college that was when things took a huge turn. I suffered a concussion during my first year of college while playing football, after that I started to fail majority of my classes and eventually I had to drop out after my first year. 

Then the pandemic hit. I bounced around from working in a restaurant to working at Home Depot and now to working as a sprinkler fitter apprentice. My coworkers don’t get what it’s like to suffer with depression, they’ll ask me if I’m alright or whenever I’m having a bad day they’ll ask if I’m okay and when I do tell them. They just tell me to man up instead. 

I honestly do not know what I want to do with my life, I’ve always wanted to raise a family of my own but I don’t see it happening anymore. I don’t feel normal and I don’t think I ever will. I currently take antidepressants, I have had anger management therapy growing up and have had therapy for my depression throughout high school. Nothing helped.

My coworkers don’t get what it’s like to suffer with depression, they’ll ask me if I’m alright or whenever I’m having a bad day they’ll ask if I’m okay and when I do tell them. They just tell me to man up instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly do not know what I want to do with my life, I’ve always wanted to raise a family of my own but I don’t see it happening anymore. I don’t feel normal and I don’t think I ever will. I currently take antidepressants, I have had anger management therapy growing up and have had therapy for my depression throughout high school. Nothing helped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided that once I hit 35 years old and that I’m not going to be a burden to anyone once I take my own life. I do not want to leave this world and hurt my friends and my mom. I love them incredibly and I want to see them all succeed and live a happy life. I just don’t see myself sticking around for long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone else is feeling this way, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This sucks.

I was signed off originally a couple of weeks ago. I have an app thing which allows me to contact my GP without phoning/making a face-to-face appointment, so I updated her on the whole situation and told her my anxiety was feeling a little better due to combination of meds and being off work. She then said it was a good idea to further my sick leave.

I agreed originally. Then I realised I'd only be getting £95 PER WEEK sick leave. That's not even enough to cover my rent.

So I'm heading back to work on Monday when I do not feel ready mentally. I hate the place. I hate the coworkers. Before I signed off sick I ended up having several panic attacks before and after the shifts. The job itself can be so damn stressful because of the speed and monotony (it's a factory where things very often go wrong).

I don't want to go back, but I have no choice. I asked my doctor if I could go back before my sick leave ended and you could tell even she doesn't think it's a good idea. But I honestly have no bloody choice.

&lt;p&gt;I was signed off originally a couple of weeks ago. I have an app thing which allows me to contact my GP without phoning/making a face-to-face appointment, so I updated her on the whole situation and told her my anxiety was feeling a little better due to combination of meds and being off work. She then said it was a good idea to further my sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed originally. Then I realised I&amp;#39;d only be getting £95 PER WEEK sick leave. That&amp;#39;s not even enough to cover my rent.&lt;/p&gt;

As Im only going thorugh first semester, and the stress just drains me and it sucks going home with a report card saying that I barely just passed.  It was so embarssing seeing my friends face when she saw my results, and i just wished I couldve resisted and said no.

I moved to a new country just over a year ago hoping I can restart evrything and get good grades, ig its not the case. All of my friends are super smart and are getting decent grades and some have even better. 

As an asian, its just shit if your no good in maths. Well im that asian. Im not very academic and just dissapoints me that getting just passing grades are not good enough for my parents and me.  I hate being the stupid one in my group that only gets C’s. I always think to myself, I dont fit into the stereotype of an asian cuz i get bad grades. Just for some background info, some asian parents are super strict especially if it s about school.

I recently got my marks for some of my main subjects, and ofc I did pretty shit. As Im only going thorugh first semester, and the stress just drains me and it sucks going home with a report card saying that I barely just passed.  It was so embarssing seeing my friends face when she saw my results, and i just wished I couldve resisted and said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to a new country just over a year ago hoping I can restart evrything and get good grades, ig its not the case. All of my friends are super smart and are getting decent grades and some have even better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an asian, its just shit if your no good in maths. Well im that asian. Im not very academic and just dissapoints me that getting just passing grades are not good enough for my parents and me.  I hate being the stupid one in my group that only gets C’s. I always think to myself, I dont fit into the stereotype of an asian cuz i get bad grades. Just for some background info, some asian parents are super strict especially if it s about school.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about a decade, but this morning and week have been difficult. Mornings have become increasingly difficult over the past year. My depression, anxiety, lack of gratitude, and overall selfishness caused me to destroy the most important relationships i had. I wake up with the guilt of how i destroyed those relationships, although mutuals think we were both at fault for destroying it. They seemed to have moved on from our relationships, and im stuck within the rut. One is an ex who broke up with me, but still reaches out when they feel low because they feel as if i know how to be there for them. it’s a trip and makes me feel horrible, but i want to be there for them because i still love them a lot. 

I have been unemployed (mostly by choice) because i wanted to focus on personal projects, but i haven’t had the confidence to believe stay focused, and i have felt too overwhelmed and shut down during the process of working. I feel inauthentic within everything and feel very isolated while working because i don’t feel the support i’m looking for. Although i have a few closer friends remaining and family, none feel entirely great to talk to because i think i forgot how to connect with people after all those other relationships ended.

I could try to connect with “new” people, i have many loose friends (who were closer in the past, but i haven’t spoke to many people since the start of covid), but i fear reaching out because it’s been so long, and i don’t want to burden anyone with my draining energy. I feel like the only part of my identity that’s remaining is negativity. I don’t want to just dump my emotions onto people. Also i don’t know what feels good, or bad anymore when connecting. I feel out of place everywhere because i don’t know who i am, so i shrink into myself. how do i get myself out there to connect without having these thoughts? 

i feel like a loser because i feel as if i’m good enough at what i do. im in my twenties, and was positioned to do well within my industry (art and media). My work used to feel amazing, but now it feels horrible. i’m letting all the traction i’ve built continuously die. Everyone I know is propelling and working on amazing projects, but i feel stuck in my tracks. I wake up and go into my studio to work for almost 10 hrs a day, but nothing ever comes and I end up spacing out. Everyday passing unproductive day is further discouraging because i truly desire to work but it proves to me that i’m not able to. capitalism has me drained.

,depression,"My best friend of 5 years cut me off 3 years ago and I still think about him constantly. Not in a sus way. He was like my other half. I could be real with him and he could be real with me. The problem is, he was always jealous of me. Girls would gravitate towards me, specifically, girls he LIKED would gravitate towards me. He was a self conscious guy so it hit hard a lot. He's really socially awkward, and all that and I wasn't. I know I sound narcissistic, i'm just trying to relay what he had told me in the past so you guys can understand. A lot of the time, he hated me, not because i'm a terrible person, but because he hated himself. He always wanted to try and find ways he could change himself. I didn't really try to help him because I thought he was great just how he was. Anyways, here's the big spill. Basically, around 3 years ago, me and him both went through pretty terrible breakups at the same time. We came up with a plan to steal his parents alcohol. We did it and he felt guilty and told his parents. He blamed me completely. His parents started hating me and he wasn't allowed to hangout with me anymore. A couple months after that, we switched schools and stopped talking for a while. Then we started talking again and we decided to hangout at the gym, now here's the real kicker, he never actually told me he wasn't allowed to hangout with me. He got caught with me and once again blamed me. This sounds toxic on paper but there's just something about it that seems off. Anyways, that's the story.

Now my mom's in the hospital and they think it's cancer. I really need a friend right now and he's the only one that comes to mind. Should I give it one more go? I mean we're both adults now

,depression,"If this turns into a long post, I'm sorry and thank you for taking the time to read it.

I (29F) WAS seeing someone (29M) for roughly 2 months. We were very open to eachother about our MH. We both suffer from depression and anxiety however I've been able to manage it the last few months whereas his has gotten worse over the year.

Everything started out ""perfect"" open communication, positive attitude, fun light conversations daily. I didn't want to rush into anything as I was wary it might affect my MH. I guess the whole ""you want what you can't have"" is true because he seemed very interested and eager to hang out. Well.. fast forward I started developing feelings and when I reciprocated his feelings/attitude I guess it scared him and overwhelmed him (he didn't explain that until after we ended things).

In the last 2 weeks I've noticed he has gained a lot of weight, is sleeping all day, taking more Ativan than he used to (went from once a week to twice a day). Started smoking cigarettes again and his mood went a complete 180.

I've asked him why he suddenly doesn't want to hang out anymore/like me and he just says he doesn't know. That hes been feeling like this the past year (I'm assuming unaware of his feelings). He also said there's no point it evaluating it because he's done (with me).

I can't tell whether this is his depression and he's alienating himself from me (apparently he has a tendency to do that). Or maybe he just doesn't like ME anymore. When I ask I just get one worded answers ""yeah idk"" ""that makes sense"" ""I'm overwhelmed"" ""I'm confused"".

So my question is... Should I cut all ties like it seems he wants or should I continue to tell him I'm there for him if he needs? 

My last msg to him where I told him I wanted to be friends and if he needed anything to reach out but he completely ignored it. 

I'm trying not to waste my time as I've been known to do in the past. But I'm just going off of my own experience where I self sabotage and want the person to fight for me.

I'm contemplating reaching out to one of his best friends for advice but I feel like that makes me some crazy ex who isn't over him.

My childhood plays a big part in it.
It hurts a lot to think about. I just feel like my body doesn't even belong to me.. I feel dirty in my own skin, I can feel them touching me and staring at me even though I never see them anymore.
They were my childhood friends. I call them BAS.
Their were three of them, they were girls. They're all roughly 5ish years older than me.. it's really confusing to me. I grew up with them (I don't see or talk to them anymore) and I have these two different versions of them living in my head.
One where they were always there for me, watching out for me, making me happy and listening to me when I needed it. Helping me stay away from the loneliness that comes with being the youngest of five.
The other where they took advantage of me, my admiration for them, my desire to fit in with them. Making me do things I didn't like or understand even though they had to know it was wrong..
I dont know which one is the real them, which one to remember and focus on. The good, the bad. I think the bad outweighs the good but I dunno. They did some pretty terrible things. Maybe I'll make another post explaining what all they did if anyone's interested at all. I just need some advice.
I dont know how to feel or what to do. My body feels like its against me, it doesn't belong to me. It's just something's that's been used and abused by them, me, and so many others. A constant reminder of what's happened and how I can never escape it. It's just so unfair, I wanna cry but not really. I dont know.

Sometimes I feel angry I was betrayed, but mostly, these days I only feel sad. Throughout the years you were trying to be a good friend, and yes, you hurt me a few times, but you never meant to.

Even all the abuse you suffered at his hands, when you came back, despite all your damage, and despite everything we had been through, I could see you were trying your best to be a good friend…

So…what happened? Did you finally give up? What made you betray my trust? What made you treat me so horribly? Why’d you defend your friend when he was in the wrong? 

Some nights I feel like I can almost understand you. We’re the only ones responsible for our own happiness, right? So maybe you just did what you did because it made you happy…it sounds selfish, but it made you happy so I guess it was worth it right?

You told me you just wanted to move on. But do you even have anything to move on from? You told me you wanted to help take away my pain…to make me happy again despite all the trauma I’d endured…or at the very least, you would try. So in the end, what are you really moving on from? I lost my best friend, my love never even had a chance, and my trust has been shattered yet again.

This is not the first time I’ve been abandoned, so why did I think it’d be different? Falling in love with you gave me hope again, that maybe we could be happy together…and once again, hoping gets me hurt. Dreams aren’t real, and life isn’t fair.

At the very least, I know you are happy now. You accused me of simply wanting your love for myself. You said you knew what I really wanted…but I always told you what I wanted was for you to be happy, and now you finally are. You will never find out, but I will always keep my word. Even after all the pain you’ve caused me? I want you to be happy, and I hope it lasts forever. I love you. Always.

Edit: more rambles incoming - you called me greedy, saying you knew what I really wanted, and implying I only loved you for selfish reasons. Except, I’m not, am I? All I wanted was a chance I never had. Life isn’t fair, I know that. Most people never get a chance with people they love, that’s just how life is. It isn’t greedy to want a fair world. It isn’t greedy to want something you can’t have.

My parents are abusive and weird and no one will understand without judging. My dad doesn’t let me do things like go on a walk, do laundry, or even get the mail. He doesn’t let me touch the AC which has resulted in me going to the ER from heat strokes and passing out. I’m not allowed to feel any emotions aside from happy which i never feel, no one takes me seriously when if I’m sad, mad, or hurt. My parents use my ER trips as a way to point out how i don’t take care of myself when it’s really out of my control, they don’t realize i’m not choosing to be sick. My mom got violent with me last week and my dad blamed it on me even though i was the one hit. They don’t care about me and i don’t give a fuck about them either.

I'm genuinely happy most of the time, though I still have a lot of issues with social anxiety and being around people in general.  But sometimes I still have bad days.  And sometimes, I have really bad days, like I did earlier today.  

I have a food addiction.  I'm not obese or anything, but I definitely need to drop about 20-30 pounds.  I've really been making an effort to eat better the past 2 months or so, but sometimes I slip.  When I got my coffee from Dunkin' Donuts this morning, I also got 2 jelly donuts, and after I finished eating them I was so angry at myself.  And from there I just went into a downward spiral.  

A couple hours later, deeply depressed &amp; hating myself, a co-worker almost bumped into me as I was walking through the office.  I've always been friendly with this particularly co-worker, but we don't really know each other and I wouldn't say we're actually ""friends"".  Anyway, without thinking about it, I said ""that's ok, I'm used to not being noticed"".  She then proceeded to ask how someone could not notice someone as tall, handsome and well-dressed as me.  I almost burst into tears and collapsed to the ground.  I explained to her that at the moment, I was in a bad place mentally &amp; emotionally.

She explained that she had a son who has similar issues with depression and she told me she truly understood what I was feeling.  She told me that if I ever needed to talk to someone, I could always come to her.  I was blown away, and I had a smile on my face the rest of the day.

I always expect the worst from people.  I always think that everyone is laughing at me or talking about me behind my back.  I automatically assume that people are either going to ignore me or treat me like garbage.  But sometimes people surprise you.  I really need to remember that.

,depression,"Why does it almost feel inevitable for this wave of depressive symptoms to hit? 

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, I've been at a new job for the past few months (it's a sales job so looots of anxiety there) and I love what I do. Except lately, I just have had no motivation. I clock in and then go back to sleep for another hour or so and then feel guilty about my ""time theft."" I am so lazy in my day-to-day work where I do the bare minimum and then call it a day once my 8.5 hours are up. I *want* to do better though which is the big conflict in my head because to be fair, I am doing really well like I am consistently recognized as a good worker and I've noticed with my job, there will be periods of ""slumps"" so sometimes I wonder if it's just a bad day/week but it's never gotten better, per se. I know I can do better but I feel burnt out (I've yet to take a day off besides weekends) or just depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of work, it's a bit better. I don't do much with my days and I haven't really been taking care of my hygiene (don't get me started on my knot of a hair!), which was actually my therapist's first suggestion of depressive symptoms (about a month ago). It just feels inevitable that all of that has almost snowballed into this low-effort, almost apathetic but also guilt-tripping self. The battle between wanting to do more and looking back and realizing how lazy I feel is eating me alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, I have a coworker I love. We have grown to be really good friends and they are constantly supporting me but I can't help but feel jealous of all their success. And that jealousy makes me want to antagonize them which I know is sooo petty and wrong of me. They literally gave me recognition at our last meeting and yet here I am chastising them for exceeding so many team goals. And then it just raises that question of why not me? Why can't I get myself to do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if it's depression or laziness. How did this depression bout just suddenly come? I like the way things are going, in a way, like I like my job and the value it brings people, I am getting more time to myself and for self-care yet I feel like I can't even take advantage of any of this because of this guilt that feels reinforced by my laziness or depression or whatever it is. It's crazy because when I last met with my psychiatrist (like 2 weeks ago), I was bragging about how awesome I feel. Now, it's just slump. For context, I'm taking Sertaline (like 50 mg, which I think is low?), Buspirone, Vyvanse for my ADHD (which I increased the dosage of recently... I wonder if that brought upon all these depressive symptoms?), and birth control.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do to bring up my motivation or to stop being so freaking lazy ugh.

,depression," 

I recently read a post on r/SuicideWatch discussing how terrible psychiatric wards are to suicidal patients and how they do more harm than good. I will be primarily piggybacking off that post but also adding my own thoughts.

I'll preface by stating that I have been in and out of psychiatric hospitals since I was 11 (I'm 23 now). Doctors who work in psychiatry operate under the assumption that the ""magic pills"" they dispense will restore a person to ""normalcy"" (whatever that means) and any resistance to accepting their treatment is just the manifestation of denial and delusion that put the person in the ward to begin with. The bottom line is that a hospital will just lie about statements you've made and do anything to fabricate a reason to keep you more or less incarcerated in the units. They make money based on how many beds they fill so why should they let you go? After a day you are more or less settled in the unit and a ""known quantity"" (meaning they know your risk level) so why should they go through the hassle of bringing in a new patient who may actually need the help? Patients who are easy to manage make them just as much money as more difficult patients, as evidenced by the fact that when difficult patients are brought in they are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, usually transferred to group homes or other long term care settings within a day or so. It's the people who are somewhere in between who get royally screwed by the hospitals, and for good reason. They want to wring as much profit as possible from you.

I am not against psychiatric care, and I certainly don't believe that a person who is actively suicidal or has attempted suicide should be left to their own devices. I have seen many people who, thanks to a simple chemical imbalance in their brains, had profound mental illness that was cleared up through a relatively simple regimen of medication and therapy. That is certainly called for (IN CERTAIN CASES), but the ""one size fits all"" approach to psychiatry does not work for all patients and in a lot of cases these medications do more harm than good. Many medications completely destroy your energy, sex drive, and cause you to turn into a shell of your former self. Your entire personality, everything that makes you you gets sucked away. It's also important to realize that we are only about 20 years in to this experiment in mass medicating the population, the SSRI's are so overprescribed that they are actually permeating the water supply in cities like Los Angeles on account of so many people flushing them. So take the advice of the doctors with a grain of salt, they represent one side of the argument and they have spent years of medical schools being brainwashed into the idea that medication is the only acceptable response to any set of issues a patient may be confronted with.

Getting to the subject of psychiatric wards themselves, I've seen downright sociopathic behavior by staff in those facilities that would make your skin crawl. Restraints performed by staff unnecessarily out of personal spite towards patients, nurses who were just downright rude and unprofessional, the wards are filthy and barely cleaned, and the doctors are condescending and see patients as widgets in a money making machine, not people who need help. The focus is on profit, then on treatment. This leads to, in my experience, patients being taken advantage of. I am not your standard ""in and out of psych wards"" patient. I have a degree in mathematics with a minor in physics, I'm highly intelligent and I have a good job. If you listened to the doctors and nurses talk to me, you would think I were a random homeless person talking to the walls and defecating in his hospital bed. Just a complete lack of respect and regard for people's dignity. If you are actively suicidal, a psychiatric ward is NOT the place for you. You should think long and hard about your options before you attempt, because if you don't succeed, and those doors close behind you, you are not a person anymore. You have no rights besides the right to do what the hospital staff tells you to do. Think about it before you give up your autonomy by giving the police power to take ""emergency custody"" of you.

I could explain why I have no hopes and why all my dreams are nightmares. I could write about why the only thing that I feel anymore is fear. If only I knew why.

That's the reason why I tell my family members almost obsessively, that I love them. Even if I'm not particularly fond of them. When the end comes I want them to know that they were loved.

I'm scared of it all ending forever, the universe gone. I'm scared of our planet being destroyed. I'm scared that after I die, I will never really be gone. Infinity scares me. I think I would be easier for me to get my point across if I write about the things that don't scare me. There's not very many of them, I'm afraid.

,depression,"Hey y'all

I don't know if this is an appropriate subreddit to ask this but I need help.

Me and my gf are in LDR since past three years and we hail from a country where people don't give a shit about mental health.

I was getting a vibe that she isn't doing well since past two weeks. When I enquired, she brushed off the topic saying that its just work stress and all.
But I know her, she isn't like this. So I seriously asked her what's going on and why is she not feeling well. She cried and told me that she is fed up of her life and there is so much pain that she can't feel peace. Something gloomy keeps poking her thoughts at all times.

She has started comparing her life and work to all those around her and that makes her feel like shit. I try my level best to boast her up and encourage her but all in vain. I tried telling her that self love is most important but I guess that's not how to talk to a person who's already depressed. 

I have started to feel afraid to say something to her as she gets mad over small things. It's affecting our relationship and me  too and I don't wanna lose her. I love her so fucking much. 

I wanna know as what should I do to make her pain less? How can I handle this situation? Any advice will be appreciated.

,depression,"I (20f) have been struggling with this hell of a disease for as long as I can remember at this point but have been able to at least semi get by but now I'm on the verge of letting my demons win. Back right before COVID I moved into my own apartment at 19 years old it was a little pricier than I wanted but I was able to make it work with just me and the cat. Then COVID hit and my buddy (27m) lost his place to stay so I offered to let him stay at my place at first it wasn't too big of a deal but then I would come home from work the food would be gone, my weed was all smoked, and nothing would be cleaned.

,depression,"As the title says, I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all of my classes this semester. 

Some background info on me is that I am considered a senior and up until a year ago I was usually an a/b student. I have never been diagnosed with depression, but have gone to doctors in the past for depression like symptoms (fatigue, excessive sleeping, loss of interest, trouble concentrating, etc.) . Tests were done to rule out other causes, and questionnaires were used for anxiety and depression. When the questionnaires were given to me, I purposely didn't answer truthfully as I was afraid that a diagnosis would negatively impact my future. I also have been struggling with this on and off since middle school, but had been able to hide/mask when the symptoms became bad. 

A couple of years has passed since seeing the doctor, and I have been progressively getting worse. I just feel lost, like I'm drowning, and don't really care if my future is negatively impacted anymore; I want to be able to be happy or feel anything. Last year I had started visualizing  myself cutting/ slicing my forearms  or I had felt almost a pain to tear my forearm open. **I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING TO PHYSICALLY HARM MYSELF ON PURPOSE.**  I just keep seeing/ replaying it in my head, but I know that giving into it will not help and make things worse for me. Also, the tiredness became too much for me that I couldn't even muster to open up online classes or even basically take care of myself. 

What I need to know now is how do I get help, is there any way for me to fix my semster/gpa, and should I take a semster off to get help?

,depression,"I've always been reluctant to put psychotropic meds into my body and have opted to use natural boosts like exercise, meditation, healthy eating, connecting with ppl and whatever else brings me joy and nourishes my body and soul. I haven't always been consistent with those tools so it's hard to say how effective they have been (I definitely notice a mood increase after socializing with genuine friends and a calmness after exercising or meditation). Anyway, I hit a very rough mental health patch 2 years ago, feels like depression on and off with some anxiety, intrusive thoughts and mood swings (they haven't actually diagnosed me with anything specific because I'm highly functioning I guess or just don't quite fit anywhere). I was suggested meds and decided to give them a shot. I have tried a few. Prozac 10 mg, made me numb, so I stopped it after 2 months. Abilify 2 mg, seems to have quieted the intrusive thoughts and according to my BF my mood swing intensity decreased. I didn't feel too different however. I stopped it after a month due to my overall med aversion. I started Zoloft 25 mg a month ago and it caused me to have night sweats, headaches, stomach issues and suicidal ideation (I've never experienced it before), the whole time! I'm tapering off of it now! I read that these are signs of excess serotonin (which must mean I have normal amounts of it naturally).

I just started Gym again and am hiking more hoping that this will help me and I won't need to try another med. I'm in grad school, am working part time and am functioning pretty well. There's just a fear of having those super bad days where I cry in bed all day or can't sleep due to racing thoughts. I really don't think my chemistry is out of whack and I want to try being healthy more consistently to hopefully not need medical assistance. I also hope to do more meaningful things with my days, maybe volunteer at a wildlife center and create art, to feed my soul. That's what I believe the real issue is. Many of us struggled with lack of fulfillment and authentic living, causing our essence to revolt in depression and anxiety! Unless there truly is a chemical imbalance! That's a different story, I just feel that it's not mine. There's no way for doctors to know what goes on in our brain (neuronally) so that throws me off and makes me not want to keep trying various pills. Plus if the brain is actually functioning normally, I read that SSRIs can fuck with it in some irreversible way. 

Guess my question is, what has your experience been with meds and other methods of healing? Have you found what works for you without a concrete diagnosis? Has a healthy lifestyle and self care taken care of the intense blues? Have you found a way to live more authentically and the anxiety dissipated? I know that life ebbs and flows and that we all experience stressful times... I'm just seeking relief from the pretty consistent (2 years) feelings of unhappiness. Yes I'm in therapy, just found a different therapist who can see me more consistently and hopefully will be a good fit. That's another reason I'm stopping meds.

,depression,"Let me just preface with saying that I'm not at all religious nor am I interested in pushing a religious narrative to you guys/gals/gulls

My official stance is there isn't sufficient evidence either side for whether or not there is a God and if there was, any religions depiction of how they see God doesn't appeal to me...but that's not the point of this post...this might be a long one but please bear with me 

I love philosophy, I also love ethics, logic, psychology, history...I guess I love learning. However, philosophy is my top love. 

I was raised in a family of philosophers, I'd be given crazy ethical scenarios from a very young age and it's left me deeply caring about, well what it's all about really.

I really struggle with retaining stuff and understanding difficult concepts so it's a huge challenge but I'm starting with the high level stuff so maybe this will end up the ramblings close to a stoner that's lost count on her 5th puff.

I've been relearning about ontological arguments (arguments/reasons for God's existence). It's incredibly interesting, I appreciate listening and being able to challenge them. 

I noticed a common theme of people using logic and reasoning to prove God's existence however for the God they're trying to prove exists; he would have to exist beyond reason.

For example, God must be able to do literally anything and everything. So could he make a rock that he himself couldn't move? 

God must know everything that has happened, will happen and is happening...but we have to have free will too...while he knows exactly what we're going to do and it's all basically laid out on the strings of fate.

The crazy thing I realised though, people aren't stupid...within reason..believing in God isn't about accepting the facts and the logic that he MUST or MUST NOT exist. 

No, it's all about faith.

Having the faith that there is this all powerful being, beyond reason and logic that's there and exists. The understanding that no matter how many challenges or problems or anything really you go through, God has your back.

I realised that everyone needs that something that ""has their back"". Gamblers rely on that big win, people rely on their family, there's people who rely on their soul mate or job or even knowing taking this drug will let their worries go away for a bit and it's not that different.

Even though logically, the odds are against them, the gambler still has faith in those tiny odds or they get their partner is human and can fuck up and be selfish at any given moment but they have faith in that person. 

I started thinking about Descartes, ya know, ""doubt everything"" and ""I can think I'm doubting my existence therefore I exist"". Good ol' Rene...The only thing I can 100% know is real is this bit in my mind that's doubting everything in the first place 

So all I know is myself...

Then I found it really really weird how my anxiety completely operates on empirical knowledge and logic. ""This has happened before, therefore it can happen again""/""they're laughing, they're laughing at me""/""I've been called weird therefore I'm weird"" 

Not really realising that me, my life, being here right now able to type this out defies so much. There's not logic to why I'm here, there's no real evidence to who I am. My existence and who I am like deep down defies reason and I've been trying to learn and improve using tools like logic and reason. 

I wondered what it would mean if I just accept I'm not logical or reasonable. I want to be kind but I'll do selfish things sometimes, I promote something and do the exact opposite minutes later, I'll feel smart and pretty one minute and hate myself the next.

I make no sense, Other people don't make much sense either...everything around me to a degree doesn't make much sense either. Sure we have some idea and getting a better idea everyday and we've ticked some pretty big boxes on how stuff happens but there's so much that we don't know 

I wondered...what if I accepted that a lot of me is beyond reason that I'll do things that are illogical, I will see things in an unreasonable way and have crazy logic stuff going on and it will drive me insane if I try to figure out why I do it 

And what if I just started having a little faith in myself. Faith that I'm doing okay, faith that I'll get to where I wanna go, faith that I know what the right thing to do is, faith that I'll do every task to the best of my ability at the time, that I'll treat everyone that best that I can and if I'm challenged by anything in life I'll have enough faith in myself that I'll get through it. 

It's crazy, it makes no sense...but me being here is crazy, I make no...or at least little sense...I defy all the odds to ever exist by being here.

Maybe I just need a little faith in myself.

,depression," 

I fucking moved schools in yr 11, and I really thought I'd be fine. It's one of them schools for smart ppl which I already hate, but the point is that's the only reason I moved, because my old school was dangerous and has a poor education.

I don't have any friends, and it's so lonely. Ofc there's people I talk with and sit with during lunch, but it's mostly everyone talking to each other and me sitting there. It's lonelier than being alone.

I've tried to make friends on multiple occasions. It just never works out, either there's no connection and we're just really different people, or I feel left out OR they turn out to be either a homophobe, racist or a combination. Sometimes there are people I talk to who I think could be friends, and it's just so fucking dumb, how hard it is to ask, and just start. And there's always this thing I feel like no one likes me. Because I really do think that.

There's this big ass joke about me, that I'm from the hood, just cause I'm from a shitty ass poor fucking suburb. I kind of just laugh along but it's getting on my nerves fr.

Also there's such a long travel that burns me out every day, and I've never felt more sick and unhealthy in my life. I feel like at any given point I'll collapse, and I keep getting actually sick, to the point where I can't learn or study.

There's no connections with my teachers either, I just don't know how to connect with anyone.

I'm exhausted and I don't want to do this anymore. I'm failing one of my subjects, not doing too well in the others, and overall feel like I have no hope. I want to move back to my old school, but it's halfway through the year and I'm just trying to stick it out. i don't want to say how I'm feeling because my parents are already pretty busy with their own shit and i just don't know what to say.

everydays a hassle, and everyday I don't want to wake up, don't want to do anything.

Everyday when i wait for my train i think about how easy it is to just jump out in front of it.

Honestly even before this school, I don't think i was okay. I was cutting myself (and I stopped), and overall miserable. Sometimes i don't even know why, I just feel hollow. But at least then I had friends, and I don't think i realised just how important they were",t2_a9w3pa38,False,,0,False,I am not okay,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_n625to,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1620316770.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fucking moved schools in yr 11, and I really thought I&amp;#39;d be fine. It&amp;#39;s one of them schools for smart ppl which I already hate, but the point is that&amp;#39;s the only reason I moved, because my old school was dangerous and has a poor education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any friends, and it&amp;#39;s so lonely. Ofc there&amp;#39;s people I talk with and sit with during lunch, but it&amp;#39;s mostly everyone talking to each other and me sitting there. It&amp;#39;s lonelier than being alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried to make friends on multiple occasions. It just never works out, either there&amp;#39;s no connection and we&amp;#39;re just really different people, or I feel left out OR they turn out to be either a homophobe, racist or a combination. Sometimes there are people I talk to who I think could be friends, and it&amp;#39;s just so fucking dumb, how hard it is to ask, and just start. And there&amp;#39;s always this thing I feel like no one likes me. Because I really do think that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s this big ass joke about me, that I&amp;#39;m from the hood, just cause I&amp;#39;m from a shitty ass poor fucking suburb. I kind of just laugh along but it&amp;#39;s getting on my nerves fr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there&amp;#39;s such a long travel that burns me out every day, and I&amp;#39;ve never felt more sick and unhealthy in my life. I feel like at any given point I&amp;#39;ll collapse, and I keep getting actually sick, to the point where I can&amp;#39;t learn or study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no connections with my teachers either, I just don&amp;#39;t know how to connect with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m exhausted and I don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore. I&amp;#39;m failing one of my subjects, not doing too well in the others, and overall feel like I have no hope. I want to move back to my old school, but it&amp;#39;s halfway through the year and I&amp;#39;m just trying to stick it out. i don&amp;#39;t want to say how I&amp;#39;m feeling because my parents are already pretty busy with their own shit and i just don&amp;#39;t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everydays a hassle, and everyday I don&amp;#39;t want to wake up, don&amp;#39;t want to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday when i wait for my train i think about how easy it is to just jump out in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly even before this school, I don&amp;#39;t think i was okay. I was cutting myself (and I stopped), and overall miserable. Sometimes i don&amp;#39;t even know why, I just feel hollow.

tl;dr - i loathe myself immensely, i have no aspirations, i smoke weed everyday and i have no idea what i’m doing with my life. someone give me advice please.

i’m almost sixteen and all i do is smoke weed, wait for school to end just so i can: go home and lay down in bed for hours, watch porn and play video games until morning all so i can repeat this wretched cycle over and over again.

where did it all go wrong, i’m only fifteen? i’m still trying to answer that question. but i believe it the first lockdown last year. i would do everything i mentioned in the previous paragraph except from smoking weed and going to school. i stayed up until 07:00 every morning and woke up at 13:00, in turn affecting my health - physically and mentally. i was always tired, and it made my skin very pale. although it didn’t give me spots, it opened up my pores and i quite literally looked like a zombie. i kept up that routine for about six months and never aimed to change it in spite of the fact i felt like shit every single day. i didn’t feel the need to, video games and porn was there to make me feel better. i was looking forward to going back to school but when i returned i quickly remembered how shit school is, especially with covid-19 regulations on top of my social anxiety that i obtained over the first few weeks. i got it due to my appearance, how ugly i became from that lockdown routine and other insecurities that i won’t even mention here because i’m that insecure. so i found out about weed, found a guy, got some paraphernalia and started smoking weed. it was a way to bare the burden of going to school everyday. i hated school. no, no, i simply didn’t care. i didn’t give a single fuck about school and just wanted to go back into another lockdown so i could waste away my life further. so i followed that routine up until december, which was when i thought “what are you doing? you’ve been like this for too long now just get your shit together this isn’t you. you used to be a good kid; got good grades, got girls, got good friends, was very fit and attractive, always helped your parents and had motivation and ambition.” so i started to workout, revise and try get my sleeping together. i was making progress very slowly but it was better than nothing. when 2021 came around i thought it would be my time to really get it together and “no more fucking around anymore” but we went into another lockdown until march. obviously that reversed all my progress and led me back into my previous lockdown routine for another three months and saying “i’ll get my shit together soon it’s fine” for the whole of lockdown. when i went back to school the same thing that happened before happened again. after a few weeks of school i decided to sell my pc in hopes of bettering myself. in april i decided “okay, you’ve been in this rut for a year now, now it’s time to actually get it together for summer.” so i did. for the whole of april i: got my sleeping together (slept at 21:00, woke up 06:00), found a source of income (made a few bills), started working out again, eating healthy, going outside, talking to people, taking cold showers every single morning (although i was already doing this two years prior to all of this), nofap and overall just trying to focus on bettering my mental health. however, no matter how much i slept, that bright skin tone i used to have never came back, my skin is still terrible to this day despite my efforts to revert back to what i used to be. no to mention my other insecurities as well as the ones that i have no control over.

but no matter how hard i fucking try i always go back into those wretched habits that got me into this rut in the first place. i think it’s been incredibly bad for my mental health. i’m quite certain there is something wrong with me at this point. maybe depression, personality disorder, bipolar, extreme anxiety? and no i’m not being a self-diagnosing, attention seeking little fuck. i’m out here because i believe i’m actually in need of help and despite the impression i may have outputted through my writing i’m not one to seek for attention and it makes me fucking wonder how did i, out of all people, end up like this? everything i swore not to be as a child. i fucking hate it. i hate myself. not long back i planned my suicide. as soon as i leave the house i’m finding a way to end it all; whether that be with a gun, jumping off a building or any other painless methods. teachers ask me what do i want to be when i’m older like i always think “i don’t know i plan to end it all as soon as i get the chance”. and every time i think of negative thoughts like this (all the time) i think “where did it all go wrong? i was such a good boy with so much potential and was so kind.” never in a million years would i expect myself to become this abomination i’ve become i can’t even express my feeling properly because i’ve become that fucking stupid. i can’t take this fucking shit anymore fuck me my parents are always so good to me always giving they’re all for me just so i can smoke weed and jerk off fuck my life what happened to me ;(

like i said i know what you may be thinking about the kind of person i am but i’m not good at expressing my feelings especially not in the state i’m in now. and i think there’s actually something wrong with me. and i’ve never talked about this to anyone i’ve been bottling all of my emotions for the past year and on nights like these it just pains me thinking about my life and i always cry in silence so i don’t wake anyone up and that pains me so much i just want to let it all out and typing on reddit is probably my coping mechanism oh my fucking god i’m so fucking retarded what’s wrong with me what am i doing here.

hm i just remembered - i’m a guy. oh yeah as ever minute goes by people’s care for me decreases and when i become a man no one in the world will care because we’re men we don’t have feelings do we? which is fine i completely understand and i’m not against it it’s just the way life is. but i’m just in so much pain it hurts and i’ve only been here for 15 years ;( oh my fucking god i have much more to endure. and i hate to sound like that little bitch but i’m really bad right now i’m in need of help this is completely out of character for who i am and it’s been like this for so long i don’t know who i am anymore i’ve lost all hope for me i’m simply just living right now waiting for jack shit as each day goes by, wasted. fuck my life i’m sorry if i ruined anyone’s day fuck me why am i still typing but i’m still going to post this to see if anyone replies although it’s fine if they don’t i don’t expect anyone to care i’m just another person with issues i’ll get over them yeah yeah i’m not even going to check over what i’ve written fuck my life oh my god OMFG fuckkkk i just can’t anymore. i wish i could just wake up in the perfect life, perfect healthy body although i guess i already did, 15 years ago, but i’ve fucked it all up already. help. please.",t2_bwtdqljx,False,,0,False,wasting my life,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_n5tbuo,False,dark,0.78,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1620285003.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifteen (sixteen in a month), male&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"""Everybody's gonna live, and everybody's gonna die..."" listening to Everyday by Mac Miller on repeat is my tone for tonight, as I'll lay in bed breathing through the nothingness that I feel within myself, like anyone else could do similarly. I saw some video of a Miller-type beat someone'd made, the thumbnail / picture was of empty shoes with a silhouette of (presumably) Mac Miller, it just hit my feels different and here I am, posting as if it'll help me through what I'm going through.

I'm scared to reply to some posts for fear of not making a point worth the point of commenting or whatnot, maybe it's agoraphobia like my mom suggests. That, and I want to feel more important than a comment even though there's no difference. I'm scatterbrained so I'll have no coherent thought besides ""hey, I'm ranting, *sigh*.""

I have no interests for one reason or many, I used to like games and that's quickly dying down, music is good but I can't hardly call it an interest. I like computer stuff enough to have been pursuing a bachelor's in it, but I've spent each of these 5 years since high school just climbing a mountain that never ends. And I thought about it this semester, how I didn't like coding or learning about how the utmost basic computational circuitry works, and I'm like ""I can't feel comfortable making a living based off of this shit, I'm gonna hate it soon."" Any motivation or praise just feels like it's meant for somebody else, and I can never accept anything positive, legitimately. I gave up on school after barely two months into the semester and have now had some dicked dead end job at a messy bakery just downtown for about a calendar month now, just as something to do while I try to let life figure itself out for me while I'm petrified to do anything for any sense of reasonable change all the while. At least I have it good working in some place that isn't hostile but it reminds me of how I don't like existing, lol. At least my first hunting for a job wasn't a failure but it's no where near a success. No muscle definition (or worse, the opposite) and stamping bags / boxes with the company logo for nearly my whole shift, while pleasant and not an absolute disgusting mess I'd be given to do any other day, did leave me with my core sore as hell and wanting to quit. How pathetic from some kid, I hope the manager thinks to their self. They got the whole ""so nice it's annoying / oppressive"" environment going on. My first couple weeks, I got straddled with a cold / sore throat that wouldn't solve itself so I had to get professional help and a medication. My family won't hear any of this so I needed to release a little of the pressure on my mind.

It's all just a dead end. The weight of needing to fulfill my mom's wishes to be self-sufficient for my own self, the weight of ""you need to figure your life out,"" it all just sits on my shoulders like those pain in the ass vests you have to wear to get an x-ray, like if at the dentist, y'know? Or maybe that's the stamping soreness talking, hah.

The song I mentioned at the start of this post? I always thought the lyrics were ""Everybody's gonna lose, everybody's gonna die..."" It makes more sense to me that way. It's very difficult in an OCD way to accept my way of thinking things vs what might be perceived as common knowledge, moreso that there's a difference or what have you. My sense as an individual has almost always been obliterated. So my one step for tonight is to accept that I think the lyrics of that song are what I think - everybody *will* lose, and everybody *will* die. It's painful but, if everything is painful then is anything really painful? I'm pretty sure it's still painful but I hope this'll help me cope before I find the next motivation to post my inane ramble to a pit of nothingness.

So my one step for tonight is to accept that I think the lyrics of that song are what I think - everybody &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; lose, and everybody &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die. It&amp;#39;s painful but, if everything is painful then is anything really painful? I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s still painful but I hope this&amp;#39;ll help me cope before I find the next motivation to post my inane ramble to a pit of nothingness. If for some reason you&amp;#39;ve read this shlock, go try and do something you&amp;#39;ll enjoy, please, and take care.&lt;/p&gt;

I took it out 4 years into a job that was killing me mentally ( guess I was depressed just never went to docs with it) needed 12 months to lapse before doing you know the deed so my family were supported (I looked into the lot). 

I couldn’t do it because I couldn’t leave my daughter and wife without a father or husband. But shite the thoughts are coming back.... well they never really left  just tried focusing on other things to gain a better life for us take away one problem less stress etc.

,depression,"Trigger warning: mental health 

Hey guys, seeing as it's mental health month I thought Id share some of my personal experiences to support people going through similar experiances.  This post is those that are struggling and those who want to understand and help. Be warned its kinda heavy. 

 Many don't know that I've struggled with severe depression and other forms of mental illness for the past 6 years. I have finally developed some coping mechanisms to be able say I've come through the other side flourishing. I've been through the mental health system and have plenty to share to anyone who needs to hear but I'll try keep this brief seeing as it's just a Facebook status.

Having depression and the other mental health issues at the same time was the toughest experience I've ever had to endure and its something I would never wish on my worst enemy. It hurts me everytime I think that I know so many people are dealing with this, often at times mentally alone. I am lucky enough to have finally come out to the other side and some people don't so here's some things I learned based on my experiences that might help.

1. For those of you suffering from depression no matter what form I know that it is the toughest fight you'll ever have to fight. you feel alone and are constantly battling in silence while everyone else seems to have it all figured out. You feel like you shouldn't exist and at times all hope feels lost like there is literally no reasons to fight left.  only now that ive finally gotten out of it I have to let you know that there is something worth living for. the depression Will end. the type of clarity mind body and soul now that I defeat depression I can say it is worth waiting for, enduring for. I would relive all those fucked up years again if it meant I could be free from it like I am today. This will happen to you

2. The people around you would rather want you at your absolute worst no matter for how long, they would rather deal with the shit you give them from your depression or mental health issue for the rest of their lives than to lose you completely so don't ever think your doing them a favour by leaving. you are not no matter what your mind says. 

3. You are not your depression. It's external. Don't blame yourself for the actions you make while depressed or mentally unwell because that's not a part of you. it's not your personality. it's something else.bsomething you can't control. The people who really know you will see that. Don't spend your time blaming yourself for your actions. You don't deserve that. You'll get better it's just going to take time. You're dealing with something externally trying to fuck up your whole life and just by living you are doing your best to fight it. You are an absolute legend. What your doing is enough. 

4.When those thoughts come back telling you how your worthless, no one likes you, you're not worth anyone's time, the worlds better off without you ect.. Try to fight back each time that thought comes up do your best to counter it. For example the biggest one for me was you should end this what saved me was the counter thought no. one day this will end and life will be normal again. It doesn't have to be that major but for any negative thought counter it with a positive one. The small fights won matter. 

5.Get talking. find someone you can truly trust and just open up about everything let it flow you've been keeping this on the inside too long it will help don't be afraid to be vulnerable. 

6.For those on the outside looking in and know someone is struggling badger them honestly always invite them out get them out of the house never stop annoying them with your presence. show them theyre the same person they always were in your eyes and just never leave their side this is who my sister was for me and it helped me beyond words I am forever grateful. 

7.for those experiencing some sort of disorder and are struggling listen to your friends and family when your not in your right mind let them guide you don't resist in that moment they know what's best for you so don't resist them. 

8. To family's that have someone dealing with mental illness or depression and are looking to get involved in the mental health system be very wary. With inparticular admitting your loved one to one of NZs mental hospitals, they are not what they seem but in some cases are necessary. The hospitals havnt been updated since the 90s and you are sending your love one to a place with a bunch of strangers alone. A place where instead of therapy and love they get pills and scrutiny. I know In some cases there is no option but out of my six years my time in those hospitals were the worst hands down of my life. I've never felt so disrespected, unloved, abandoned, judged, and misheard and misunderstood. I'm not the only one with this experience. Also once your in the system it's damn near impossible get out. Try therapy first. If anyone wants to know more about this just speak to me. 

9. Lastly I just want to say to the rest of you who haven't dealt with it personally depression can be invisible. When I was at my absolute worst there was not a thing you could do or say to get me to show you I was depressed or suffering so be kind, you never know who's struggling or how much your kindness could mean to someone. When some one does open up listen. You don't need to offer life changing advice. Listening is enough.  Remember mental illness is something to be understood not judged. 

There is a lot of hope for the mentally ill in my experience people are so supportive now and just want to help they just need to understand a little more and that's what I hope to achieve with this message. If anyone wants to chat about anything or is struggling I'm here please message me. I care and I've been through it.

I’ve gone to therapy, looking for it again currently but am on the verge of giving up trying to find another one. I always get to this point where it just looks brighter being gone. I know it will affect my friends(lol) and family, but after a while they’ll kinda just move on. I fucking hate thinking like this, but I always end up here again and I don’t know how fucking not to.

,depression,"Pleasw, avoid the hate and lets talk like civilized people.
Recenntly I have been thinking on suicide and the possible consequences. Well, I am starting to think that suicide is not that bad.
First. When you commit it is because you want to scape from life. So it is your life and you can do whatever you want with it. 
Second. People who ""loves"" you, dont want you to die because they will suffer, they are not usually thinking on you and your issues, they are only thinking on their suffering, not yours.
Third. Following the past point. Well, if people really love you, they would never had let you fall so deep that you are considering suicide. If they really loved you, they would have kept you save.
Fourth. Also, following the past point. They will overcome your death eventually. I mean, my parents overcame their parents death. One aunt overcame the death of two of her sons. So, there is no death that you cant ""overcome"". You should be damaged before to cant do it.
Fifth. If there is nothing after death, and you literally disappear after dying. There is nothing to regret. If ""rebirth"" exist, I think you forget everything, so, nothing to regret. If there is something after death, well, it is problem for your future, if you regret your suicide.
I know I am probably wrong, but, I dont know, man. I cant see a good future. Because, lets pretend that I became a succesful person in society, and I have a good life. But, suddenly, the world will start to going to hell. The water is starting to be scarce, the polution is still increasing. And the governments arent doing anything to save the planet. We know it. It is stupid to think that environmental problems are getting better.
Also, what is the point of living. Imagine that you conquer the world or whatever. And then? Whats next? You only die as the other people, and thats all.

,depression,"Adventure Time has always been my favorite show, all while growing up and even now that I’m 24. I constantly seek escapes from reality. I play a lot of video games, read books, and watch shows. I love Adventure Time for a lot of reasons but as I’ve gotten older I have realized that a big reason for that is my escape tendencies. Imagining I could live in a world where all you’d have to do to find adventure is walk out your front door. It wouldn’t cost you money, you wouldn’t have to get work off, you wouldn’t have to travel far to get away from the judging eyes of society, no worries of parents to report to or check with. You could be friends with mutated candy people, a vampire, a sentient robot, princesses that rule a kingdom still gave you the time of day even though you live in a tree house and do nothing but play. Your dog is also your brother and best friend all in one package, and would be by your side no matter what. 

I love watching the show. But it triggers me in ways deeper than any conversation I’ve ever had with someone has. Trigger is the word ill use for lack of a better term. I know better than to watch anywhere near the last season, let alone the last episode unless I am ready for a weekend of staying in bed. But I wasn’t expecting to be hit as hard as I was with this episode, it wasn’t one I had paid attention to much before. The episode revolves around the pursuit of a being who can teleport, a Door Lord. He uses the power to steal precious items from people, their keepsakes, their most cherished possession. It steals Jakes baby blanket, BMO’s controller, PB’s T-shirt given to her by Marceline who is secretly just there to hang out, and Finn’s piece of PB’s hair. I seemed to be fine doing fine with the episode, it seemed just like all the others I had watched repeatedly. They had to perform a song like a “Genuine Band” to open the door to get their stuff back. Jake pretends to be the diva of the band, he make sure everyone is aware he is pretending. Marceline makes awkward jabs towards PB who reacts confused, embarrassed, and upset at the things being thrown in her face so publicly. Finn spends the episode desperately trying to get everyone to cooperate so they can open the door, and when things finally fall apart enough that everyone begins walking away from each other, he begins singing an impromptu song “What am I to you”. This is where my emotions take over.

To me the song is meant to show that even though we can spend years of our lives with people, we can still be insecure and unsure about our relationship. Am I really your best friend? Or just someone you spend your down time with while your real best friend is at work? If we weren’t brothers, would we spend this much time with each other? Would you still care about me? I’ve had these questions my whole life about every relationship I’ve ever had. Always. And I haven’t ever had a moment of clarity where I felt comfortable in my answer to those questions. 

Today, I cling desperately to any second i can spend with my brother. He spends all his time working a full time job, going to full time school, then helping his wife with their son while she goes to her job and does her school work. All while they have another baby on the way. As his brother i should be nothing but happy for him. And i am. But i am also alone. And scared. And sad. I pray that i can come over sometime on the weekend, but he explains that he and his wife work opposite shifts. The only time they spend together during the week is while they swap car keys, or make too much noise getting into bed. My brother knows my situation so he does his best to have me over on Sunday, but I can’t help but feel like i am a wedge in between two magnets pushing me back out of my brothers life. They need that time for each other. That’s how its supposed to be.

My parents spend their time doing the things that await most adults. They salvage what they can of their hardened relationship, dented with fights over money, kids, and mistakes they’ve each made. They do their best to make what’s left of their own parents life comfortable and hopefully containing some semblance of humanity, even though my Grandma wakes up most mornings not knowing where she lives or why her son isn’t there with her. They too work full time jobs, paying my sisters way through school. “At least she’s in school” they must think. Any time spent around them is full of the same questions. Why aren’t you going to church? Why can’t you go on any dates? Why don’t you spend the weekends with your friends? When are you going to try school again? 

My best friend growing up is now married. He also liked Adventure Time he always told me. The months before his wedding I was actually living with him and his parents (mine sold my childhood home and didn’t have the space for me anymore). We were going to finish Adventure Time before he was married, we never did. We had three more seasons left, but he had other priorities. He spent every minute not at work, in her arms very literally, and often on the couch in the living room i slept across from. I was supposed to be happy for him. I am. But i am also lonely. He never wanted to get married. He talked about it often, i would comment in disbelief. I would tell him how i would give everything away to be with a girl that truly loved me as much as i did her. She asked him out. We went from hanging out every Sunday and at literally any chance we had during the week. To really maybe once or twice a month. And never again once he was married. 

I have to go back to work tomorrow. Surrounded by small talk and work drama. People who call me their friend but know that the second they get out of that place, we’ll likely never talk again.

I constantly seek escapes from reality. I play a lot of video games, read books, and watch shows. I love Adventure Time for a lot of reasons but as I’ve gotten older I have realized that a big reason for that is my escape tendencies. Imagining I could live in a world where all you’d have to do to find adventure is walk out your front door. It wouldn’t cost you money, you wouldn’t have to get work off, you wouldn’t have to travel far to get away from the judging eyes of society, no worries of parents to report to or check with. You could be friends with mutated candy people, a vampire, a sentient robot, princesses that rule a kingdom still gave you the time of day even though you live in a tree house and do nothing but play. Your dog is also your brother and best friend all in one package, and would be by your side no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love watching the show. But it triggers me in ways deeper than any conversation I’ve ever had with someone has. Trigger is the word ill use for lack of a better term. I know better than to watch anywhere near the last season, let alone the last episode unless I am ready for a weekend of staying in bed. But I wasn’t expecting to be hit as hard as I was with this episode, it wasn’t one I had paid attention to much before. The episode revolves around the pursuit of a being who can teleport, a Door Lord. He uses the power to steal precious items from people, their keepsakes, their most cherished possession. It steals Jakes baby blanket, BMO’s controller, PB’s T-shirt given to her by Marceline who is secretly just there to hang out, and Finn’s piece of PB’s hair. I seemed to be fine doing fine with the episode, it seemed just like all the others I had watched repeatedly. They had to perform a song like a “Genuine Band” to open the door to get their stuff back. Jake pretends to be the diva of the band, he make sure everyone is aware he is pretending. Marceline makes awkward jabs towards PB who reacts confused, embarrassed, and upset at the things being thrown in her face so publicly. Finn spends the episode desperately trying to get everyone to cooperate so they can open the door, and when things finally fall apart enough that everyone begins walking away from each other, he begins singing an impromptu song “What am I to you”. This is where my emotions take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me the song is meant to show that even though we can spend years of our lives with people, we can still be insecure and unsure about our relationship. Am I really your best friend? Or just someone you spend your down time with while your real best friend is at work? If we weren’t brothers, would we spend this much time with each other? Would you still care about me? I’ve had these questions my whole life about every relationship I’ve ever had. Always. And I haven’t ever had a moment of clarity where I felt comfortable in my answer to those questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I cling desperately to any second i can spend with my brother. He spends all his time working a full time job, going to full time school, then helping his wife with their son while she goes to her job and does her school work. All while they have another baby on the way. As his brother i should be nothing but happy for him. And i am. But i am also alone. And scared. And sad. I pray that i can come over sometime on the weekend, but he explains that he and his wife work opposite shifts. The only time they spend together during the week is while they swap car keys, or make too much noise getting into bed. My brother knows my situation so he does his best to have me over on Sunday, but I can’t help but feel like i am a wedge in between two magnets pushing me back out of my brothers life. They need that time for each other. That’s how its supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents spend their time doing the things that await most adults. They salvage what they can of their hardened relationship, dented with fights over money, kids, and mistakes they’ve each made. They do their best to make what’s left of their own parents life comfortable and hopefully containing some semblance of humanity, even though my Grandma wakes up most mornings not knowing where she lives or why her son isn’t there with her. They too work full time jobs, paying my sisters way through school. “At least she’s in school” they must think. Any time spent around them is full of the same questions. Why aren’t you going to church? Why can’t you go on any dates? Why don’t you spend the weekends with your friends? When are you going to try school again? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best friend growing up is now married. He also liked Adventure Time he always told me. The months before his wedding I was actually living with him and his parents (mine sold my childhood home and didn’t have the space for me anymore). We were going to finish Adventure Time before he was married, we never did. We had three more seasons left, but he had other priorities. He spent every minute not at work, in her arms very literally, and often on the couch in the living room i slept across from. I was supposed to be happy for him. I am. But i am also lonely. He never wanted to get married. He talked about it often, i would comment in disbelief. I would tell him how i would give everything away to be with a girl that truly loved me as much as i did her. She asked him out. We went from hanging out every Sunday and at literally any chance we had during the week. To really maybe once or twice a month. And never again once he was married. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to go back to work tomorrow. Surrounded by small talk and work drama. People who call me their friend but know that the second they get out of that place, we’ll likely never talk again. My only Adventures are spent alone. And on the weekends. And usually they are me driving down the roads I’ve driven a million times, pulling over when the urge to jerk the wheel taking me over the guard rail and down the canyon becomes more than just a passing thought. Then i go back home to find an escape.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to ask my family for help, but something stops me. Sometimes I want to go to my parents and just cry while they hold me, but I feel like I should be dealing with this on my own. I&amp;#39;m too old to be acting like a scared kid, I don&amp;#39;t want to burden them.
I just want to feel okay again, to feel at peace with the inevitable when it comes. It&amp;#39;s a struggle to get some sleep because of this existential dread.
I&amp;#39;m so tired. Something I feel like I should go back to the psych ward, but I could barely afford it the last time I was there.
I just needed to vent a little.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
Hey everyone. Ive been going through a really rough 3 months with some severe depression and anxiety, especially depression. I have had MDD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years. Both of which are really bad. I took off the fall semester from school hoping I would get better and just worked, and then planned to return to school for the winter term. I tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that I unrolled from all of my classes, quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents. 

We thought things would have gotten better by now, but they’re only seeming to get worse. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high where I can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy. I feel like I can cry for hours which never used to happen. My anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with Xanax until my antidepressants start helping. 

So far in my life I’ve been on 8 different antidepressants and none have worked very well. I have just come off of Lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell. Now I’ve started taking both Wellbutrin and Sertraline, which I’m trying for a second time. 

I’m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy, I was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two, so I’m now talking to her twice a week. 

I’m having a really hard time if I should work this summer, so from when lockdown ends until end of August when I’ll move back to school. Or if I should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better. I have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me. So the money aspect isn’t a huge issue. The only part I’m struggling with is at the current summer job I have, I’m guaranteed full-time hours this year and get 3 days doing the job that pays the most in tips, and I’m concerned that if I take a year off I won’t get that next year. I’m just having a really difficult time deciding. 

I also do feel suicidal every day but not to the point where I figure out a plan to do it, more just wishing it was something I was brave enough to do &amp; then hating myself for having those thoughts. 

Any advice would help, thank you.",t2_byt1ht7u,False,,0,False,should I take the summer off to better my mental health?,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_n6062n,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1620279644.0,,[],{},,True,,1620308244.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone.

10 years ago, I felt so confident and in control of my life. I was a fun guy to be around and had lots of friends all over the world. Despite suffering from depression, I managed to have a relatively good life. I had lots of interests and had a lot of fun pursuing them.

Fast forward 10 years, now I am the most miserable anti-social fuck out there. I hate myself. I went from what I once was to a guy that no one would want to be around with zero confidence and a life completely spiraling out of control. I don't react positively or negatively to anything and nothing phases me anymore. I no longer find anything fun or worthwhile and no one wants to talk to me, and I don't blame them! I would like to say that all of this was due to depression rotting me to the core and destroying my personality, but I am sure that I am also somewhat responsible.

Now my girlfriend has decided to leave me, even though I put the little that I do have to give into this relationship and helped her with so much along the way. I have no friends in a thousand mile radius from where I now live and no matter what I do I can't find it worthwhile anymore.

I've tried years of therapy, countless medications, and just about everything I can think of to combat the fact that I've changed into a person that no one, including myself, would ever want to be around.

,depression,"Some back story..  all my life I've battled with depression. Teen years and early adult were rough. At 18 I got addicted to a number of prescriptions then followed by painkillers. It all helped fester a set of toxic beliefs and I took it out on my community. 
I was charged with a number of theft related crimes and was sent to prison for almost a year. 

When I got home I was determined to prove my worth. I stayed sober, still am and I've stayed straight with the law. I've reached out to make amends with family and have earned forgiveness from most people in my life. I battled through guilt and depression the first few months home from prison but honestly things fell into place so fast. I got a better job than I've ever had. In the last 4 years I've paid off 65% of my debt. So many other little accomplishments. It seemed I had escaped depression and anxiety. I truly felt so free and so optimistic about my life. 

Until a couple months ago. Started feeling really drained at work. 5 days a week, away from home for 12 hours those days. I got an interview at an hvac company my friend works at and it seemed promising. The owner seemed to really vibe with me but once I brought up the felonys it seemed over. I explained my side and what I've done since to prove I've changed but they ghosted me.

I have battled through depression before. I came out on top and these last four years I've felt free and happy. Two months its crashed down around me and I feel so sick and lost.

Teen years and early adult were rough. At 18 I got addicted to a number of prescriptions then followed by painkillers. It all helped fester a set of toxic beliefs and I took it out on my community. 
I was charged with a number of theft related crimes and was sent to prison for almost a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home I was determined to prove my worth. I stayed sober, still am and I&amp;#39;ve stayed straight with the law. I&amp;#39;ve reached out to make amends with family and have earned forgiveness from most people in my life. I battled through guilt and depression the first few months home from prison but honestly things fell into place so fast. I got a better job than I&amp;#39;ve ever had. In the last 4 years I&amp;#39;ve paid off 65% of my debt. So many other little accomplishments. It seemed I had escaped depression and anxiety. I truly felt so free and so optimistic about my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a couple months ago. Started feeling really drained at work. 5 days a week, away from home for 12 hours those days. I got an interview at an hvac company my friend works at and it seemed promising. The owner seemed to really vibe with me but once I brought up the felonys it seemed over. I explained my side and what I&amp;#39;ve done since to prove I&amp;#39;ve changed but they ghosted me. &lt;/p&gt;

Let's find a Way today,
that can take us to tomorrow.

We'll follow that Way,
A Way like flowing water.

Let's leave behind,
the things that do not matter.

And we'll turn our lives,
to a more important chapter.

Let's take the time and try to find,
what real life has to offer.

And maybe then we'll find again,
what we had long forgotten.

Like a friend, true 'til the end,
it will help us onward.

The sun is high, the road is wide,
and it starts where we are standing.

No one knows how far it goes,
for the road is never-ending.

It goes away,
beyond what we have thought of.

It flows away,
Away like flowing water.

,depression,"Everything I do, my brother does 10 times better. While I'm failing all of my classes, he doesn't seem to have any problems maintaining his high G.P.A. While he gets to be smart, win awards, gets accepted into great high schools, I might drop out of my high school. While he has no problems making friends, I go for weeks without talking to anyone. While he has a bright future to look forward to, mine just looks bleak.

He never struggles with anything. He can perform highly on anything, without having to study. I (attempt to) study for hours on end and fail. He can learn anything with no problem, while I struggle with the easiest problems.

,depression,"So for the past two years I've been working on a story that's taken over my life and made me look seriously insane. Sad fact is that I'm totally 100% correct on this. 

When I say ""story"" one would interpret this as ""conspiracy theory"" because it's hard to believe that a random person with no professional training or experience can get something like this correct. Oddly, building this story has actually helped me put my past suicidal thoughts in remission due to what it entails. This remission I speak is basically being ""scared straight"". 

Because this story is taken as a ""conspiracy theory"", saying I'm right gets me dismissed because that's what any conspiracy theory crackpot idiot would say; it's all so very frustrating.

Some people actually believe me, but for some reason don't have the same alarm as I do (this story details first degree murder), and this bothers me more than people being kneejerk in calling me schizo. I consider that last part a badge of honor because many gifted people have had their brilliance misunderstood for mental illness.

That's not to say I have an untreated mental illness because I do from all this. It's not in the DSM-V because, again, I'm right on all this.

We were part of the same friends group in a way. My other friends have also abandoned me because of my legal troubles and drug habits. I do drugs to escape the reality I&amp;#39;m drowning in. Hell, it&amp;#39;s to the point that I&amp;#39;m starting to believe hes right about me. My dad has always hated me. Growing up my dad would always refer to me as a piece of shit. Basically every day in high school he reminded me of how he feels. My friends even heard him say it and stood up for me one time. I want to kill myself but I dont have the courage to pull it off. I&amp;#39;m sorry for the rant yall. I just needed to vent really bad

,depression,"Today my sister and I got into a fist fight over a misunderstanding. She gets physical over little things, and then heated. She hasn't held a job in 10 years and she's in her mid 30 's and living off my mother's savings, she's a brat and feels entitled. I work very hard, and my field is something you have to struggle and crawl up towards, and I spent my 20's working long hours while fighting depression to get to a successful career.

I suffer from severe depression. I was suicidal a few years ago, it all goes back to my family. They're really messed up. I wouldn't call them bad people, except maybe my sister, but she's more spoilt than anything. She's come in town to visit currently.

I was handing her a plate for dinner and I had tissues in my hand. Her finger was caught between the plate and tissues and I couldn't feel it was there. She kept saying ""finger, finger"" and I didn't know what she meant. She finally said ""my finger is caught"" and instead of giving me a chance to release it, she punched me in the stomach. I told that hurt and there was no need for that. She said to ""man up"" and that ""it was just a tap"". I told her you could at least apologize and she told me ""f\*ck you"". We started arguing, and it became a fist fight.

Rest of my family came in, they started accusing me of starting it. My mother started calling me crazy. I've been alienated by the 8 or so odd people who live in this house.

My mother walked in again to argue after 30 mins and I tried to hurt myself. I started smashing my head against things and picked up some scissors to stab myself if she didn't leave. They've left me alone for now.

I've messaged my therapist back in the US and just waiting to hear from back from them.

I'm not American, but I live in the US on work visas, and again, I worked very hard to earn those work visas. My sister is a green card holder through her husband.

During the argument she started taunting me that she has a green card, and I told her you married someone and did nothing for the last 10 years, in fact they're getting divorced because it turned out they couldn't stand each other and he's already moved to Europe with some other woman. I worked my ass off to earn a visa, her having a green card means nothing compared to working 15-16 hour days Mon-Sat for years to finally get that message that it all paid off.

Due to the pandemic, I'm stuck with my family in their home country and have been for the last year. My sister and I are the only ones who don't live with the family, but she's still living in her own place. I've fallen back into depression and rejoined therapy after an incident with my mother, where she called me crazy, again.

I have nowhere to go. I don't know anyone in this place. I don't speak the language. It's a third world country so its not safe to go out at night, especially for someone like me who hasn't lived her in years and I look like a hipster. My best friend back home has been trying to calm me down over the phone all night to keep me from hurting myself.

Last month my girlfriend and I broke up in a very bad way. We were long distance for so long. One day she and I were talking about moving in together when I got back, and out of the blue I didn't hear from her for days. She just started cutting me out of her life when she felt like it, and then dragging me back in whenever she wanted. I tried talking to her about it, and she told me I was holding her back from being free by talking about it. I told her all I wanted to do was her stop treating me like I'm disposable and if she didn't want to be together talk to me about it. This started when I was hospitalized a few months ago, and she vanished on me because of something she hasn't even told me about, I don't know what happened to this day, but the 3 months I was in the hospital she just stopped talking to me even though I kept messaging and calling and telling her I need her. At one point I came close to dying because of a misstep at the hospital, a trainee didn't read my chart with my allergies and injected me with the wrong thing. A week before my sickness is when she vanished.

When I told her I was in the hospital and I'm really sick, she told me I was being dramatic and said I had other people to talk to. She'd never talked to me like that in our two years together. We were talking about moving in together the day before she disappeared...I don't know what happened.

I ended our relationship, but she called me a month later and begged me to keep her in my life and said she was sorry and that she was in a bad place and that she'll be better and she won't do this again. I still don't know what happened to her, she wouldn't tell me. And a few months later she did it again. I finally said I can't do this anymore with her coming and going from my life whenever she pleases without explanation and then expecting us to be together again when she comes back, and she took that as I'm not letting her live her life or go out with her friends, and no matter how many times or ways I explained that isn't what this was about, she wasn't listening and kept telling me I'm being dramatic. 

So we said good bye in the worst way possible. I just wanted her to stop tossing me aside without telling me why. I loved her with all my heart, and as my therapist said to me, she abused that love. I miss her so much. I really was she was still around, but the person she was last year, not who she was now, but I know people change and she isn't that person anymore.

I just really feel like holding her tight and telling her how much she meant to me right now, but we've blocked each other on every platform and from this side of the world I have no way of reaching her anymore and we don't have mutual friends.

My sister is here for another month. We were sharing a room. I don't know what to do. I'll have to sleep in our home office.

I just really want to go home. Even from where I am I can hear my sister telling them that I was ""laughing at her"" while her finger was caught and that's why she punched me. She is such a horrible person. When she came to visit me a few years back back home, we had a big heavy gate door outside my apartment complex, you had to shove it to open the door. We were walking out and I shoved it and it immediately swung back and I guess it hit her fingers. She started saying I slammed the door on her finger and I didn't even realize what happened, just like today. I told her sorry and its a big heavy door and its hard to hold open, but she kept saying I slammed the door into her hand. I told her try pushing the door herself and see, it's a big, heavy door and it was an accident. But she started screaming a storm about how I slammed it into her hand.

She's in her mid 30's and acts like a child with pity arguments and then she gets physical. She's making threats that she'll post photos of her cuts online and say it was me. I have no evidence except my word to counter that, she's the kind of petty person who would actually do that. I'm the only one in my family currently earning, she doesn't realize once my mother's well dries up, either she gets a job, or she has to deal with what my mother rations her from MY earnings I give my mom.

I don't want to be around anyone right now. I don't want to be around these people. My old therapist told me before I left the US the last time I need to find things to distract from my family, to stay away from them. They used to say these people are triggering to me and I need to find ways to keep them out of my life. I don't want to die, but I want to hurt myself.

,depression,"I was a happy person and always excited to wake up the next morning but it all changed January 10th 2020. My mom came home from work crying. After suffering a stroke and after multiple attempts to take his own life, my grandfather made his last attempt and suceeded. I think that's when the numbness really began for me. It started small then grew over time. I think my grandfather's death was really the decline of my happiness. After that day my grades in college began to decline drastically. I was unable to take a trip to greece during the summer that I had been planning for over a year. My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer.

I can't sleep most nights because I have panic attacks. The worst of all though? My dad.

He shows every emotion except happiness as anger. He's sad, irritated, mad, bored?  He yells at my mom and I. I can normally handle his outbursts because I do understand that he didn't have the best childhood. But right now in my life, I am terrified of upsetting him.

My anxiety got gradually worse each day. Main reason is because I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I thought I wanted to be a baker so I work at a bakery now but all I really managed to do was turn a hobby into a job, which was a mistake that my family warned me about. My job is cool and all but i don't think it's my passion. I get very anxious before each shift and it makes me not love the job overall. I don't know why though- my coworkers are super nice and my tasks are pretty fun- nonetheless, I still get mad anxiety about work. Trying to find something new to pursue, I bought a book about stocks and investing because it's something I want to get into. It's informative but again, anxiety takes over me because it tells me I need to confront my financial situation. I have money saved up (from the government during covid) but if I didn't have that money, I think i'd be screwed because what i make isn't enough to support my rent + everything else i spend money on. I'm studying a degree that I'm not passionate about (yes, I want to quit that but my mother won't let me.. and yes, I've tried to talk to her but it didn't work.) I think that if I were to actually find something I could realistically pursue whilst earning money and actually being happy then it would convince my mom to let me drop out of school.

But I just can't think anymore. I don't want to. It's extremely overwhelming. The thought of my unknown future is really fucking up my life. I hate working but how else am I going to make money. I don't have many friends but even the ones I have now, I don't meet due to covid and social anxiety. I can't fully immerse in exploring what I want to do in the future because of school. I just realized my UTI came back and it is making me so miserable. i don't want to spend more money on antibiotics with the possibility that my uti could come back, so now I'm anxious about that. I am a bitter person who becomes very envious of other people's happiness and success. I tried therapy for a few months and idk maybe I have to try a few different counselors before i find the right one who can help me but I have limited options (I use a specific website that makes counseling affordable and there are not many licensed therapists on this site in my area). I hate that I'm extremely frugal- I literally avoid buying certain medications because it's too expensive for me. I want to be able to buy normal things without having to think for 20 minutes about whether I want to save my money. I think the fact that my family keeps telling me to get a full time job is becoming quite stressful. I don't want to sign myself  up to a 9-5 job knowing that it will literally kill me and my mental health. I really want to live a happy life and work a job that doesn't make me so damn anxious (for literally no reason).

Seeing my boyfriend usually makes me happy but even now, it doesn't help. Might be because we have so little to do activity-wise (covid), might be because I feel bad about being with him, knowing that my depression will probably kill the mood of our relationship. I began gradually depending on him for my happiness, as much as I didn't want to. Before working as a baker, baking was my escape... and now I barely want to do it anymore because I do it for work. I don't tell him anything anymore because I can tell he doesn't know what to do or say when I mention being depressed. I don't blame him though, it's hard to know what to say to a person who doesn't have a will to live anymore.

The only thing these days that gets me through is simply going on tiktok and youtube. It's a good distraction but I'm scared I'll become addicted to isolating myself as a form of therapy.

Reddit is almost like a diary to me so I apologize if reading this was a mental trainwreck for you. There's a lot more in my head but this post will go on forever. If anyone has any helpful advice, I'd welcome it. And please don't be unnecessarily rude. I just want help. I've never been this lost and.. sad in my life. Feels like this will never end.

I am really lazy and distracted. So lazy and distracted that I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about removing the notifications from my lock screen for months but never did it out of forgetfulness.
 And do you know what else? Sometimes my father, with whom I have a rather messed up relationship, puts my phone to charge before going to sleep while I wash my theet because he thinks he is helping.
Well, I just noticed that tonight the lock screen showed the messages that my best friend sent me, they contained VERY personal stuff and my father had read them all, for sure. 
I feel like shit, I hate myself with all my heart right now. I&amp;#39;m a horrible friend and I feel guilty because he decided to open up to me and tell me all those things for what? To make that dickhead of my father read that? ... I suck. I really am a bad friend.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Long story short, I used to be over 300 pounds due to a combination of shitty eating habits/antidepressants/lack of exercise. My only regret is that I didn't keep ""before"" pictures because I have plenty of people who look at me now and simply can't believe I was \*ever\* at that size years ago. After a few setbacks with covid, I've managed to get myself down to 161 pounds and I don't doubt that I'll hit my goal (150 pounds or even a little less) soon.

I've never told anyone this, but one of the major reasons I decided to lose weight is so I wouldn't feel like a complete jackass rejecting bigger people when it comes to relationships. In the past, I always had a hard time saying ""no thank you"" because of how I was raised and simply because I didn't want to be a hypocrite. I won't delve too far into the details (there are other places for that if I really needed to), but I wound up in an incredibly sexual/emotionally abusive relationship because of this.

After all, we're not really at a point where males being abused is taken seriously. Some people (especially on social media) may claim things are changing, but I'm really not sure about that.

,depression,"Recently I've noticed that many posts here and in r/suicidewatch have mentioned that they lost their relationships with their friends and sometimes even family due to depression. As a guy with diagnosed clinical depression and social anxiety, the thought of saying I have depression to my parents and friends petrifies me.

,depression,"Let me preface this with a quote from the brilliant Robin Williams:

“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it's like to feel absolutely worthless and they don't want anyone else to feel like that.” -Robin Williams

Unfortunately I’ve come to the unshakable realisation that in general society, having a serious conversation about my mental state (or even depression in general) just makes people feel uncomfortable and is entirely unproductive. *Please excuse the hypocrisy in this statement* I am unfortunately burdening you this conversation. Unfortunately it is probably fair to say this subreddit is a group of some of the saddest people. (No offence, me included)

I now believe honestly discussing these issues or reaching out for help with people I care about burdens them with additional distress and emotional pain. *It is also a strong reason though for me not committing suicide*. I would never wish to burden any of the people I care about with a fraction of the sadness and despair I feel. I feel to do so would be selfish. As I’m honestly not sure what happens after death I may as well just ride this journey of life out and see what happens... Yes, it is very possible to be depressed but not suicidal. 

##specific details / can skip if not interested##
I feel uncomfortable asking for professional help too due to just having medications continuously thrown at me like some experiment. I’ve tried probably close to 8 different antidepressants, all of which produced intolerable side effects. One particular medication turned me into a suicidal crying mess, couch potatoe who couldn’t eat anything at all. I raised concerns with my psychiatrist who was adamant it was just my depression worsening so she increased the dose and I ended up in the ICU with seizures from Serotonin Syndrome due to the psych not considering the potential reaction with two other seratonergic drugs I was prescribed. I had also lost 10kg in the two week span from not eating. Meds were changed again and I also had to take an antiepelectic drug for a couple weeks for precaution. 

Now I’m currently on Amitriptyline, an older TCA drug. It seems to have the most ‘tolerable’ side effect profile although causes excessive sweating as a side so guess what, let’s just take a medication for Parkinson’s disease off-label to try and treat that side effect. I’m 24 years old and have a pile of boxes of pills. It feels like I have a whole serving of pills every dinner (8 total each night). Unfortunately I fail to see the benefit especially when I’m taking pills to treat side effects of pills and still don’t feel better. I begin to wonder if antidepressants even work or if its no better than placebo. 

Unfortunately when all this happened I was in a military job under military health care so it was pretty much a case of take whatever the doctor/psych says or lose the job. I eventually got a med discharge for an unrelated physical injury. I’m studying to complete a degree at uni and don’t want to mess with adjusting pills during semester. Once this semester is over I want to finally ask the doc to taper me off the meds and see what I’m like. Hopefully it may even make me feel better without suffering from the numerous side effects and even the pills to treat the side effects have side effects. I’ll reassess then. 

In terms of seeking professional help I lost my faith during that while in the military. I was deceived and clearly told I was seeing an external contracted psychologist for *treatment* which should have been confidential (within legal limits). Instead, unbeknownst to me the psychologist created a *psychological evaluation* which contained information which jeopardised my job and simply wasn’t even true. In particular she claimed I expressed serious concerns about public speaking when I did formal debating as a hobby! I made an official complaint to the national registration board about poor conduct and the psychologist blamed the military. If she was knowingly conducting a psych assessment for external disclosure to my employer I believe this absolutely was deceitful and should have been disclosed from the outset. Regarding the false information, the psychologist apparently just believed it was correct at the time of writing. If she can just say whatever she allegedly ‘believes’ she could literally write anything with potentially very serious consequences for employment. 

##conclusion

I will be trying to come off all the pills at the end of this semester (with doctor guidance!) and see how I feel. Unfortunately I’ve made the realisation I just need to try my best to push through and avoid causing any distress with my family members. Yes in an ideal world it would probably be nice to believe that friends and family were close enough to discuss these things with this and they are, but I just don’t want to concern and hurt them when I don’t know what that can do.

I'm sure nobody would come to my funeral out of sadness about my passing, that they would go because ""its a funeral from a family member, we can't be seen as disrespectful"" not because i'm a person worth mourning

I sometimes think of scaping home and killing myself by jumping of a bridge, so that people would never find me, never see me again, i don&amp;#39;t like being seen when i feel depressed, it feels like im just being a burden, but i still want to tell them, tell them how shit i am, how useless i feel, how it would be better if i just died, nobody will care at the end of the day, so that maybe they say the same and i can confirm that i am as worthless as i feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure nobody would come to my funeral out of sadness about my passing, that they would go because &amp;quot;its a funeral from a family member, we can&amp;#39;t be seen as disrespectful&amp;quot; not because i&amp;#39;m a person worth mourning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself with all my heart, I hope someday I have the balls to do it, and end it all.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I was only 16 years old at the time of this event. I was a big fan of hiking, so every summer, my friends would invite me to travel around the country to set up camp. We were in a Honda Accord bound for the next city a few miles off the Oregon State. It was a beautiful sunny day - not a cloud in the sky, a perfect day for hiking. Me, Adam Ruyle, Sarah White, Mike Davis, and Jake Mills were heading out of the city to the next town, located some miles between a heavily forested area, dominated by tall, dense foliage and trees so dense and thick that it appeared as though they were blocking out the sun's rays. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and stranded. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the giggling of a lunatic... also a sickening odor like that of blood. The noise got closer to the car and it was then we heard a loud whipping sound.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a tall man, about six feet high, sticking straight up out of the water of the nearby pond. On top of his head was a tall hat with a reddish-pink ribbon. He appeared several more times, getting closer to the car. Words could not describe our fear. ''What do you think that was?'' Jake asked. ''Well, it definitely was no car, that's for sure'' said Adam. ''Maybe it's some kind of monster?'' Sarah joked. Then we just stared at each other in silence. Suddenly, everything went inexplicably silent. Not a bird chirped, not a bush rustled, not even the rain seemed to make any noise all of a sudden. I suddenly felt a pair of icy-cold hands squeeze around my stomach. ''We're dead. We died in that storm.'' Jake whimpered. ''No, no, we're going to be fine, trust me. We'll get back to town in a few hours.'' I said. ''Well, I hope so, I have a date tonight.'' said Mike. The atmosphere became less tense, and we began sharing cigarettes for the next twenty minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. That is when we panicked. All five of us grabbed our coats and went into the woods.. 'Keep together and try for the town!' I yelled.

&amp;#x200B;

After we were in the woods, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. The first scream lasted for what seemed like half a minute. I heard Adam call; ''he's got Sarah! He's got Sarah! Hey, help me! I gotta get out of here-'' - his voice was cut off in an abrupt cry.

&amp;#x200B;

The woods became eerily silent. I yelled ''Hey! Where is everyone? Adam, Sarah, Mike, where are you?'' from here on, it was just me and Jake. Jake grimaced and then fell to his knees. ''What's wrong?'' I asked him. ''Cramps.'' he said. I carried him with his arm wrapped around my neck. I carried him for what seemed like hours. Suddenly a flash of lightning illuminated the silhouette of a clearing. ''We're saved! Come on Jake, the clearing is just over the next hill.'' Then a gust of wind from the storm yanked Jake from me, causing me to fall flat on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came to, I saw Jake running ahead of me, then that tall purple clad man suddenly appeared right next to him. I got a closer look at him just before my last friend was killed. He was wearing round, large, yellow-tinted glasses. He was wearing a purple suit, with a reddish-pink bowtie. Under his purple suit was a pale yellow blouse, and he had a gap between his two upper teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a pinkish cummerbund when he appeared for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were brown.

&amp;#x200B;

From there, I must have blacked out from the shock, as the last thing I can remember is my legs burning like fire from all the running, and my insides shaking uncontrollably in fear. I honestly thought I was dead - an endless void of blackness as my mind shattered, unable to take in what I'd just witnessed. I finally made it to the town, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I walked around and was found by the rescue unit. I was in shock, and from there, I'd suffer a nervous breakdown which lasted approximately three months before I could return to work.

&amp;#x200B;

There was an employee at the rescue unit who I told my story to, he maintained eye contact with me, and nodded every couple of seconds. After I had finished, he told me in a Southern-accented drawl ''you know,'' he said, ''the world has many secrets. There is a lot we don't know about, and people don't wish to believe something such as this is truth, because they are scared to. I believe you, but there isn't much I can do.''

&amp;#x200B;

I was in hospital for a couple of days, and there were times where I contemplated if I seriously believed what I had remembered. But that's when reality kicked me in the gut and I knew that my friends were dead, and that thing/person that got them was real. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont care.

I realized its really not all so complicated as I made it out to be

I woke up in a good mood this week because I realized that I dont care

Because I know what makes me happy: doing wathever I want. The world doesn't owe me anything, I don't owe anything to the world. Thats my motto from now on.

Fuck jobs and education and responsibility. Carpe diem and stuff. Fuck the future, there is no future, you can drop dead right now, bye bye future. Live today

I do the bare minimum at work because I must admit being paid is kinda cool tho. 

I used to care about the environment bullshit but I have become familiar witth the efilism pseudo-philosophy. Is it cringy? maybe but I realized I dont care about anything, specially not the environment.

I'm going to order sex toys and fancy computer peripherals from amazon later. I don't earn enough that my savings will get me anywhere in life so its ok.

&lt;p&gt;I just dont care. Its so much bullshit I would rather not write it all down but basically I can&amp;#39;t do anything and just don&amp;#39;t want to go to so called mental health professionals anymore or talk to anyone (there is no one to talk with). I realized its really not all so complicated as I made it out to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up in a good mood this week because I realized that I dont care&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I know what makes me happy: doing wathever I want. The world doesn&amp;#39;t owe me anything, I don&amp;#39;t owe anything to the world. Thats my motto from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck jobs and education and responsibility. Carpe diem and stuff. Fuck the future, there is no future, you can drop dead right now, bye bye future. Live today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do the bare minimum at work because I must admit being paid is kinda cool tho. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to care about the environment bullshit but I have become familiar witth the efilism pseudo-philosophy. Is it cringy? maybe but I realized I dont care about anything, specially not the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to order sex toys and fancy computer peripherals from amazon later. I don&amp;#39;t earn enough that my savings will get me anywhere in life so its ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought syrian rue seeds and acacia confusa to brew ayahuasca in my home. I was getting worried reading from experiences that I should do it properly with a shaman or trip sitter. But i have no friends and I sure as hell not traveling to the jungle to drink something i can perfectly brew in my home in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i have a bad experience so what? At least my life would have changed a little. You should do the same too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk with people like me who are fucked and just dont care. THere is no improvement or getting better. Its not real, do what you want. DOnt worry about your family, they also do whatever they want. They be fine. Lie to your employer, everyone is lying all the time. Its all one big lie, its fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all make things more complicated than we need to. Maybe it was this simple all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

I was unable to do it, but somehow i made it by the skin of my teeth. It is important to note that i did have a group of friends in middle school who i was close with. When i got to highschool, it was like a weight was lifted off me. some of my friends from my middle school went to the same high school as me so i was relieved. unfortunately for me, after about 1 or 2 weeks they all found different groups or clubs to be a part of, and me struggling with severe social anxiety, was unable to be accepted into said groups. so all of my freshman year i ended up spending alone. i'd either spend lunch in the library or walking around campus looking busy. this continued thru grades 10-12, and it just became normal for me after a while. i am fortunate that i was academically much more successful in high school, likely because i did all my homework at school in lieu of being with friends or playing sports, etc.  as sad as it sounds, high school was by far the best time of my life thus far. i was able to pursue my hobbies at home without being pestered about financial obligations or societal norms/friendships by my parents. after i graduated high school, i was set to enter junior college. to make a very long story short, i was blindsided by the whole college experience.  i was able to graduate with my associates after 4 years due to not having a clear major or goal picked out. during this time i also managed to work part time. i 2017 i went to a state college and in 2020 i graduated. amazingly enough i did end up getting a bachelors degree which i was immensely proud of.  also in 2019 i began dating someone who has made me feel supported in my life choices in many regards. unfortunately, this is about where my accomplishments run out. i was laid off 3 months before graduating from state college. i didnt really care because i figured i would be able to get a nice career job shortly after graduating. so i took the severance package they offered and walked out. then the COVID hit and the world went on shutdown. the branches of the government that i was going to apply for work at all were hit with a massive hiring freeze.  so in the interim, i have been ""self employed"" which basically consists of reselling any junk i can get my hands on on sites like ebay and mercari to try and make enough money to buy food and other expenses.  i managed to build up a pretty nice nest egg, and i have been investing some of it with good results, enough to live off for now. i am relatively healthy, no major illnesses, i take no medications. i have a good relationship with my partner, who is very supportive of me. heck, i even tried to work dead end minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet, but i was overwhelmed quite quickly with the huge amount of social interaction required.  i can no longer stand to see the disappointment in my parents faces when they look at me.  at this point i dont know what to do next. i am still looking for ""career"" jobs frequently but they are few and far between. i want to move somewhere else but the real estate market is way overvalued right now so i am stuck where i am currently living. my living situation is stable, so i dont run the risk of homelessness, etc.   i just hate waking up in the morning and spending 10 hours a day just trying to make ends meet by buying, selling, buying, selling random stuff i get and trying to make money. i feel like no matter how much money i make reselling, my parents don't care at all. some weeks i have been pulling in 2500 -

,depression,"A few years ago in my 1st year of middle school I met this girl we quickly became close friends she was there fore when I 1st started cutting she was there for me when I 1st attempted suicide. She was my best friend I loved her like a sister and I made sure she knew just how much I appreciated her. She was my everything

But about 3 years ago around the beginning of the school year in high school she started hanging out with other people while completely ignoring me. Whenever I would try to talk to her she would basically tell me to fuck off. When I tried to ask her why she was asking like this towards me she would just get angry with me. After about 3 months of her acting like this I just lost it I yelled at her for a little bit before storming off that's all it was just yelling no actual violence 

But come the next day she had apperantly told all her friends that I had her by the throat against the locjers and that I tried to rape her. The rest of the year was just pure hell as I was bullied by all her friends and everyone who heard her rumor both verbally and physically. The rumor got the principal who called the police to investigate me of course they quickly found out she was lying and dropped everything but nothing happened to her. I was being bullied so bad to the point where I would stay with the teachers (who were the only ones who actually believed I was innocent) while the halls passed as I was just too scared of being confronted by someone or worse seeing her.

They would punch me insult me for being a no good attempted rapist when I wasn't throw basketballs at my head and beat me against the stall whenever I went to the bathroom.

I tired to talk to the counselor but she just said ""don't let her get to you just smile and stay positive"". I had no one I had my GF who is been dating around a month break up with me cause she believed her lies. No one wanted to talk or interact with me because they all thought I tried to sexually assualt a girl

My mom didn't help either she just said ""you shouldn't be upset over her she's still a lady your still a gentleman you need to treat her with respect"" and when my GF broke up with me she just said ""oh so your gonna cry over this little bitch too?""

This was the lowest I've ever been in my life in fact come the last day of school I tried to overdoes on pills which obviously didn't work. 

This event left me trumatized with PTSD and a even worse mental state then I was in before.

I've switched school areas so I don't see her or her friends as often but I do rarely run into them and each time I have a episode one time it was so bad I had to call my cousin to come pick me up as I couldn't drive myself home as I was panicking that much.

What makes this all worse is that all of this was cause intentionally from someone I loved and valued more then anything else on earth

To make matters worseI found out last night that she's getting into her dream school through a early college program. to add insult to injury this is the same program I tried to get into and wasn't accepted


Upon finding this out I had a breakdown so bad I almost passed out and I held a knife in my hand for an hour contemplating stabbing myself

,depression,"The following takes place in May of 2014

I was diagnosed with postpartum depression with my DD, she was 4 months old at the time. I had just gotten my own place with my EH and DD. I thought that moving out of MIL’s &amp; SIL’s 2 bedroom apartment would stop the stress and harassment that they caused me but I was wrong. These individuals kept hounding me and stressing me out. I was struggling as a new mom and had very little support from EH. He always sided with MIL and SIL even when they were wrong. 

All three knew something was off so they pressured me to go to therapy when I wasn’t ready, that didn’t work out well at all. When things didn’t get better they demanded I go to a doctor and take Zoloft. When I started taking the zoloft I became worse. My EH demanded I constantly take care of the baby while he slept, so I was sleep deprived, stressed out from being a mom with ppd, and his family’s constant insistence that I was like him and suffered from bipolar disorder because I had unresolved trauma from my abusive parents…

Eventually due to all the stress and the Zoloft just not working along with a rather terrible therapist, I snapped and developed postpartum psychosis from it all. Instead of letting me sleep and helping me feel better, MIL and EH decided that the best thing for me was to go to a psych ward.

This was the wrong thing to do. Little fact, I have a major phobia of psych wards and anything regarding anything psychiatric regarding myself. Anyways, I remember when my MIL and EH were driving me there. I sat in the backseat next to my daughter and I didn’t want to go. I just needed to sleep and get off the Zoloft that I didn’t even want to take in the first place! I kept telling them I didn’t want to go but they didn’t stop the car, they didn’t take me home, they just kept driving there to the hospital.

When we got there I refused to get out, and while EH was out of the car, my MIL told me “either you go in willingly or I’ll make security drag you in.” This terrified me and I didn’t want my daughter to witness that as well as being concerned for my own safety against the security staff. I got out of the car reluctantly and we walked in. 

While we waited I kept saying how I didn’t want this, I kept voicing it, and when it was time to sign the papers I remember asking my mother in law if that is what she wanted, and she said yes so I signed the papers and they hauled me away.

I felt so ashamed and humiliated. They did the typical intake process and what made me extremely uncomfortable was being asked to remove all of my clothing. This made me so ashamed of my body and humiliated, as a rape survivor this was horrifying to me. They watched me as I got undressed and watched me as I dressed in these awful scrubs. I still hate the color of green and blue to this day because of the scrubs. 

When I got up to the ward, I saw the locked doors and panicked. I started to cry. I didn’t belong there, I needed to be at home with my daughter taking care of her. When I entered the ward I refused my medications and would do so throughout my stay. I was watched as I used a bathroom toilet, as I showered, I was never left alone and I felt humiliated. I had no sense of privacy at all, I wanted to see the doctor and get out that night. I was never really told the reason I was admitted. 

I begged to have my breast pump there because I was breastfeeding and becoming engorged. They denied me my pump due to safety concerns and gave me a shitty hand pump. It didn’t work the way I needed to, I remember sitting down on my bathroom in the ward and crying as my pump didn't work. My breastfeeding bond with my daughter was gone along with any closeness I felt towards my daughter. 

I kept begging to see the doctor and the nurse said “if you continue to push to see the doctor, you might be forced to stay longer” So they tried to get me to eat the next three days, I hardly ate at all. They gave us food but no utensils. I was so angry at my EH and MIL and I let them know that. I called and told them exactly how they betrayed me and my MIL gaslight the heck out of me. Denying my trauma and feelings.

I was so exhausted because I was terrified that I could never leave. I thought I’d never see my DD again. It was horribly depressing. They slapped a bullshit diagnosis of Bipolar type 2 disorder on me (which has been rejected by my current therapist), and started me on 300mg of Trileptal 2x a day. A prescription that my current GP was appalled that I was given as that is something he would never have given me at all even in that situation. 

Things at home weren’t easy, my DD was diagnosed as “failure to thrive” when I was breastfeeding her and supplementing with formula. I felt like a failure because I was following her doctor’s orders to the letter. When I spoke with the therapist at the ward, I told him of my situation with my DD and how I felt like a failure. This therapist, without even contacting my DD’s pediatricin, decided it would be appropriate to call CPS on me.

I called my EH to let him know what was going to happen, and the police showed up at my home. They ransacked it and told my EH that a caseworker would be by. That caseworker never came by… I was so hurt and betrayed that I sunk further into depression. I wanted out of there. After 3 days I was released and walked out to a bus stop with tickets to get home. I didn’t tell anyone I had gotten out. Not until I needed my  EH to pick me up from the bus stop I was dropped off at. 

Surprise Surprise, not only were EH and DD there but guess who was driving, MIL… I told her I just wanted to go home and be with DD, but no, my MIL insisted we go fill my trileptal prescription. So we went to Walmart and filled it. I was so spaced out but full of rage, I was close to needing to take a trileptal again but I decided not to. After we filled it out and got home, I wanted to be left alone and told my MIL to leave so I could be with my daughter. She refused to leave my home, she told me she needed to see me take the medication and I told her no. I told her the medication wasn’t for me, and she refused to leave me alone and wouldn’t stop talking to me. So I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. She still wouldn’t leave me alone so I went to the bedroom and called 911. 

They sent over two police officers, one spoke to my EH and MIL while the other spoke with me directly. He said that since my EH was on the lease, and that he wanted his mom there, she didn’t have to leave. 

The police left and shortly after my MIL left as well… The next two days were awful. My MIL and EH had decided, even before I got out of the ward, that the next two days that EH worked, I was not to be left alone. The first night my EH’s work friend’s wife watched my DD, against my will, while EH was at work. The second night my MIL watched DD, also once again against my will. For two days I was alone at night without my DD. The time I was separated from my DD destroyed my relationship with her. She was 4 months old then and is currently 7 years old now, I’ve never had a close relationship with her since all of this happened. 

As for my EH and I, we never truly recovered from that. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal, I asked him how he could do that to me, he said he was scared and let his mother take over the whole situation… We eventually divorced after having another child but in all reality the moment I stopped loving him and started hating him was the night I was admitted. 

I constantly tried to confront my MIL about how she betrayed my trust and my feelings but she constantly denied me my feelings and my trauma. She literally told me how no trust was broken. I’ve never hated her more.

Since all this, it took me 6 years to finally go to therapy with a wonderful therapist who has helped me process all this information, she agrees that I didn’t need to be in there and that MIL is very controlling. My GP did not agree with the trileptal at all being prescribed especially on a one time meeting. He and my therapist agree that I was gaslit by MIL and EH the whole time.

,depression,"Hey guys. I’ve been in this sub for a while now and I guess it’s my turn to speak. 

I’ll start with the beginning.

2012: A Star is Born

I was a freshman in high school. There wasn’t much on my mind other than the girl who sat in front of me in marine biology. I was always great at sports, so I figured I would give football and wrestling a chance. This would turn out to be one of my fondest life memories. (Other than the bullying and beatings I would take from the upperclassmen)

My grandpa died this year. He was my best friend up until then. Sitting here at 23, I’m not sure how I made it this far without you. I miss you every day. 

I met some of my closest lifelong friends this year, although they were all seniors when I was a freshman. Michael, Lucas, Nick, and Steve (for safety I changed their names). I waved these guys farewell until I would see them in a later chapter. 


2014: Memories

I guess I remember my junior year in high school as the last time I felt free. 

Zoom forward to my third year, I’m now ranked 9th in the state for wrestling and I’ve been working incredibly hard to secure an athletic scholarship. I’ve been dating the girl from my marine biology class for a year now. We’re very happy, and I’m feeling lucky to be special to someone else. I couldn’t be happier to be the guy I am today. I just got my drivers license. Thank you mom and dad. I love the 2004 Honda Accord you got for me. 

The bullying stopped this year with my sudden growth and increase in muscle. I’ve held myself to a certain standard since then. 

2015: On Top of The World!

I guess this is where the happiness started to fade.

I am now one of the best wrestlers to walk through my high school doors. I walk the hallways with my chest up and remind myself of my hard work every day. 

Still dating marine bio girl by the way. I was lucky to have had a long three year relationship with her. I miss you Layla! 

I was able to reconnect with my friends that I mentioned I met in 2012. Wow, I had no idea that Lucas had such a beautiful sister. 

2016: New Plans

The second half of my senior year! I cannot believe I made it this far. This is incredible. I had a productive wrestling season with a record of 45-8.

Marine bio girl found out that I had eyes for Lucas’ sister. I told her she was gorgeous and had nothing to worry about. 

Lucas’ sister and I became very close friends. She would be the one to carry me through the hardships of the remainder of this year. 

I didn’t get an athletic scholarship that I had been anticipating. I came to the conclusion that I would have to go to community college to avoid serious debt. 

Lastly, I graduated! I said goodbye to some close friends that I would not see again for a long time. I miss you all!

2017: I love you

Hell yeah. I just completed my first two semesters of college. Lucas and Michael are my best friends now. We hung out everyday. I picked up a hell of a weed smoking habit from hanging with them. 

I found out that I was in love with Lucas’ sister. I broke up with marine bio girl after 3 years to pursue her. We would begin dating on March 28, 2017. 

Lucas’ sister decided she would like to go away for University. I’m not sure what happened here, but I completely threw away the idea of being debt free. I take out my first student loan so I can follow her across the state. 

I moved to the university in May. I kept in close contact with Lucas and Michael throughout my entire stay.

2018: Euphoric and Motivated 

OH MY GOD I AM AT A UNIVERSITYYYY!!! I can’t believe it! This is amazing. I want every class to mean something. I began doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and started to move up really quickly! The wrestling background helped a lot. 

Lucas’ sister is beautiful as always. We are so happy. She always talks about our future kids and how we’ll be married one day. I look forward to seeing her in our free time even though she’s out making new friends.

I am so happy. 

2019: The Smile Fades

This is my junior year of college! It is blowing by. I work as a line cook and compete heavily in BJJ. I have a record of 14-1 and got my blue belt in 6 months. Thank you Professor. OSS!!

I made some amazing friends! I love them all and they taught me so much. I have Eric, Gabriel, and a few other friends in that group.

Lucas’ sister decides to return home for a year off of school. She grew up very privileged and was given that option. We did long distance. I would cry every day and we would have terrible arguments that left permanent damage. I love her so much and can’t lose her. Please help us god. 

2020: The Toughest Year of My Life

It’s January 1st. Lucas’ sister came back to school. We have a toxic relationship and yell all the time. I still love her so much and want to make it work so bad. I’ll do anything, God. Please help me. 

This is my last year of college and I am so scared. Thank god for Eric. I see him every day and he talks to me about what I need. We go out all the time with Gabriel and everyone. I love these guys. 

It’s now March. I’ve learned that I won’t be returning to school for a while because of COVID-19. Lucas’ sister has dumped me. 

It is now May. I am depressed. I cannot do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu anymore. I am unable to find an internship because nobody is hiring. I miss my family. Lucas’ sister and I are working it out. She tells me she loves me again, and I believe her. I started a job as a roofing project manager. The money is awesome and I may want to do this as a career. 

It is now September. I didn’t get an internship so I’m simulating it in a class room. I remember crying to Lucas’ sister. She made us a candle lit dinner at her place. She wore a pink dress and we took pictures. I think everything is going to be okay.

I found out today that Lucas’ sister hooked up with Gabriel, and Eric had hid it from me for quite some time. This started a manic episode from hell. 

I found a dog tied to a tree and took him in as a foster.

It is now November. I am in a pit. I do drugs often (Cocaine, LSD, Marijuana) and I become alarmingly malicious. I had sex with Eric’s girlfriend and continued to entertain her out of anger. My emotions 
are scattered. If it wasn’t for my dog, I wouldn’t be here now. My roommate had to take my gun out of my room once he heard from Lucas’ sister that I had fallen off. 

It is now December. I’m with my family. I graduated this month. 

I found out what my student loan balance was today. $62,221 for an in-state Bachelors of Arts. Guess that’s what I get for giving my parents control of the account. 

2021: 
It is now January. I quit my job as a roofing project manager. I’ll find a new job this month. 

It is now March. Guess who learned how to do options trading! I made $15,000 in one week. 

It is now April. I lost my entire bank account through options trading. I have no job. I called my parents today and asked to move back in for a bit once I get closer to the end of my lease. 



It is now May 5th, 2021. 
I am unemployed. I google search a different career path every day. I think I’ve called and hung up on 5 therapists this week. My family and friends all saw my deterioration over the last year. I don’t talk to Lucas or Michael anymore. It is hard to see them knowing that the past is gone. Gabriel and Eric are doing well, as far as I know. I think Eric is still seeing the same girl. 


Thank you to everyone who reads this. I’ve done a good job of estimating how long I’m going to live, but I’m gonna leave that part out.

,depression,"This is my first time posting and it's long sorry.

So the past 2 months have been awful. It all started when my parents tested positive for covid and had to be hospitalized, I helped them as best I could, and luckily they made a full recovery and are healthy now. but during that time I stopped my music classes (i am trying to be a musician and performer) stopped listening to music and would just play video games and eat junk food. This went on for about a month and stuff just kept getting worse. 

I totally shut down, I've been having issues with motivation cause of my ADHD symptoms, every time I get the ball rolling with being productive and eating right I suddenly lose all progress cause of a lack of interest and progress and have to start from square one again. I decided enough was enough and stopped all my classes, my therapy (which at the time was not helping me at all), and stopped taking my meds (i was prescribed a low dose of Prozac by my old doctor but she gave it only for a couple of weeks and said it was just to lift my mood, she never told me I had a depressive disorder and said I didn't have ADHD either. I didn't think that was right given my history but i went with what she said)

I wanted to end my life and started having extreme suicidal thoughts(I've had a history of these for the past 3 years) but didn't act on any of them instead I would just sleep for most of the day and wanted my life to just waste away with me doing nothing. 

Stuff got a bit better when i got back into csgo and started playing with my friends (it was nice to have people to talk to and do things with) but cause I was a higher rank than my friends and cause i was competitive and a bit toxic(according to them...i know that sound bad but I was really paying attention to what I was saying and doing in the game and was trying my best to just talk normally, I even told them I'd just mute my self if they were getting too uncomfortable) My friends whom I've known for years flat out told me they don't wanna hang out with me anymore and i basically stopped talking to all of them. 

I don't have many friends, to begin with, so I was basically isolated both physically and socially apart from my girlfriend. I've been with her for 2 full years and honestly, it has been amazing. recently tho she has been very weird and hurtful. she wanted me to come and meet her in a different city but just for 3-4 days and gave me very little heads up (not a problem it's just how the situation was) but then the day I was supposed to leave she called me up and told me we should break up. I took a couple of hours and started to accept it when she called up again and we ended up getting back together. she has anxiety about the future and was basically just getting super worried about where we were going.

 I ended up going to meet her and stayed at her aunt's place, we had a wonderful time and I felt I was getting a bit of my energy back, she then was diagnosed with covid and has to isolate with her dad which meant i could not video call her or have a normal call cause of how her dad is. I'd text her regularly to check how she is doing but she would slowly stop responding. Then she basically told me to stop texting her since she didn't wanna talk, i decided to give her some space and then after 5 days of zero communication i called her saying we need to talk since i was feeling quite hurt with how things were going. It was not like with the video calls, she could text easily but just didn't want to and that hurt me cause i didn't say or do anything wrong she just did not wanna text me.

I called her and she basically said we should break up again and now it's done, I was with her for 2 years and we had a very healthy relationship with open communication and we both seemed happy and now all of a sudden it's over with honestly no explanation. 

This was 4 days ago

I am so numb right now, I honestly don't feel anything anymore 

I started seeing a new psychiatrist and after 3 hours of talking about my life he straight up told me I have severe clinical depression and ADHD and has started me on SSRI treatment along with a plan for CBT therapy as well as ADHD meds when I start doing work again 

I am a college dropout, I have no friends, no partner, and have given up on living but I hope that the new treatment and therapy can help me out. I wanna know how to find new friends and make a support group but because of this pandemic, I can't really go outside to meet new people.

,depression,"8 fucking years being unattractive mess with no friends, no partner, no nice memories, no job. I hate myself my life is shit and I am shit. Its too late now Im 28 I wasted „best” years of my life and Im too old und ugly to find a boyfriend or friends. I should just end my life. So many people have treated me like shit, i cant trust people even though i want to.

,depression,"For the past year I’ve found myself trapped in the routine of doing nothing almost every single day. I see so many people throughout lockdown who have learned a new skill or something similar and they all sound so motivated and fulfilled by what they’re doing. 

I started university in September but because of COVID the lectures are all online and so I just don’t bother watching them, I have no reason to get up out of bed. The only time I will be productive is if there’s a deadline the following day, so I’ll scramble to get my work done and then I’m back in the cycle. 

Despite COVID, it seems everyone except me has been going to parties and hanging out and meeting new people and have formed their groups of friends and now I’m left alone here. I have friends back where I’m from but they are hundreds of miles away. 

Sometimes I can’t even be bothered to eat. Even if I have food prepared and I don’t have to cook, I just have no interest in eating it, despite feeling hungry. 

The things I do are so pointless and bring no value to my life. I watch shows and movies I’ve already seen, over and over again. I go on my phone for SO many hours at a time just scrolling through social media or watching irrelevant videos or playing pointless games. It literally annoys me so much how much time I spend on my phone, just wasting my time, even though I know I’m doing it, and here I am doing it now. Recently I started painting, just abstract stuff or little cartoony things, and I like it, but now even doing that feels like I’m just wasting my time. Whether it’s uni work, exercise, art, cooking, etc etc, nothing feels fulfilling. 

Just before and during the start of the pandemic I hit a real low point, I lost my flat, my gf and my job all in the space of a week, and I would cry multiple times every single day, but since I’ve been at university I haven’t cried once.

This hasn’t stopped me from trying to better myself or find some small amount of happiness, I fight very hard , but I feel like I’m constantly being shattered, putting the pieces back together, and evaluating how not to break again.
It’s very exhausting and demotivating. I’ve improved a lot at least on paper but I still am not any closer to having a taste of happiness. 

I’ve tried the medication route and perhaps I’ll try it again, but I think it really exposes my weakness cause I’ve never been able to take one long enough to see if it actually helps me. The side effects have always been too much for me, whether it be sickness, feeling cold-blooded, or the most common one getting me close to suicide. 

I’ve tried therapy quite a few times and I’m going to try again once I get the second dose of the vaccine soon. I don’t get it at all, most of the time they are just reading a list of things that help depression that I’ve read off of google or online thousands of times. Not saying the list is wrong, but having it repeated to me especially when I already do these things isn’t useful. I have yet to gain any insight or help from therapy and I’m not that smart. Or I’ll try and open up about something from my past that has bothered me, and it’s just a rant cause they won’t engage with me on the topic at all. I get though, finding a therapist that is a good fit for you isn’t easy and can take a long time and I am going to try again. 

I feel like my brain is being strangled. I’ve noticed a mental decline over the past couple of years. My ability to think has been lessened, my focus is almost non existent, my creativity which use to be one of my only escapes is extinct, I’m so slow. 

I truly don’t enjoy anything. I force myself to do things because I know the alternative is worse. I still fail sometimes to be active even though I know it will be worse for me. Hanging out with friends, going to eat, playing games, even having sex is dull and boring and empty. I don’t care what is it I just at least want an escape. 

My home environment isn’t the worst but it isn’t ideal. I have no real connections with anyone here. I’ve been at my moms house sense I graduated high-school. I love my mom and I know she loves me, but I can’t get deep with her on any subject cause it always comes back to religion and when it goes to religion it just becomes me entertaining it or more likely I just go silent and nod and just stop talking about whatever it was we were discussing. I also live with someone who isn’t toxic to me, but every time  I look at them I’m reminded of the horrible things they have done In the past to other people. I care about this person, but I think I have ptsd from certain events that have happened, even now being vague, I have a hard time talking about it. 

My friends are very important to me and I know they care about me, but they have no idea how to help and why would they? I don’t expect them to have the answers or to provide comfort but I am always confused when therapists try to get me to open up to them more. 

I have a voice that’s constantly telling me to kill myself daily and the only response I get from doctors and therapists is either them telling me how common suicidal thought are among people or some version of everyone has problems. I don’t want to diminish other peoples problems and struggles, but I don’t find comfort in hearing about people worse off than me, I truly wish everyone the best, but I’m struggling with life on a deep level and if can help others through there journey I’m more than happy to help, but I don’t know where I’m even going with this one but it makes me less trustworthy of the whole medical side of things when all they can give me are statistics about how other people hate life just as much or worse than me. 

I have so much hate for myself, because of how little I’ve progressed in life. Maybe I have an excuse , but using the excuse gets me nowhere. I can’t hold down a job no matter how much I try, I always get overwhelmed and walk out , Ive had a lot of jobs as well and I just feel so worthless and useless. I know that if my mom didn’t let me live with her I would be homeless or more likely dead.

I know that if my mom didn’t let me live with her I would be homeless or more likely dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write more but I just feel exhausted from this. I haven’t given up yet but I really want to. I wish everyone the best and hope everyone finds some peace through there journey&lt;/p&gt;

Every day I just keep thinking, *I want to die*. *I want to disappear*. *I want to end things*.

,depression,"Hello and sorry for my english.

To be brief, let me introduce myself. I am a 33 year old man, passionate videogamer since I was 6, who does not expect anything from his life. Never had ambitions,  Just a simple man cultivating his hobby with video games, drones, radio controlled cars, gym......etc etc.

I was never interested in having a family or having children. I want to stay single, i'm not afraid to live alone, really not. I'm good with occasional sex, mostly with prostitutes.

I barely worked in my life, just few months, in a pc store years ago and as in a photograph studio, as ""helper"", at weddings or other events. Because i am basically lazy and always wanted to have much free time for my hobbies.

So i'm still under my mom's roof ( my dad died 11 y/o ago ), our house is quite big, even too much. I do house stuff to mantain it clean. So i'm in between a ""mommy-milk-sucker &amp; house-man"" mixed. In a few words, i live with my mom's salary.

But something is getting to change in a few months.....we selled the house for a brand new one, because the older one is too big, and requires constant manteinance, which also means a constant flow of money to spend.

With the occasion of having to move house in a few months, I don't know how, various awarenesses are being triggered within me, which I had ignored so far.

I have SO MUCH nostalgia of 90s, where we lived in a much better society, and more civilized.

&amp;#x200B;

The things that are making me with lower morale every day are these:

1- We have a large dog, which will no longer have the outdoor space available. We couldn't take it to the new house, and I don't know who to give it away to or what to do. I am suffer already for that loss.

2- My mother is getting old. Who will take care of her when she loses her mind, or when she won't move well anymore? She will call me every half hour to take care of chores, making my life impossible. Locking her up in a hospice costs a lot of money.  Along with a nanny, this will be too expensive.

3- Modern society sucks, i really don't like it. It's getting only about greediness, capitalism, rich getting richer, and poor getting poorer. It's not fair at all.  It's all a game about appearing, but not about being a...rich human being.

4- I can't accept to have to work for living. Work it's a form of slavery, plain and simple. A soft form of slavery. Problem is there are no alternative, other than go living under woods or become a vagrant.

5- I am not sure about this new home, Did we pick a right decision?   I'll have to get used to a new place with new neighbors and 1/5 of the outside space we had previously

6-  I can't accept getting older. I never accepted it. I want to stay young. I don't want to lose my hair, I don't want to see my skin wrinkeling, I don't want to see my teeth wearing out I don't want to lose my sexual appetite ....

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot put my thoughts in order, which increase every day. Honestly, I have planned to commit suicide  at 50 y/o more or less, which I consider the maximum age ""enjoyable"", before you get too old to live. A bullet to the head. Quick death, and bye bye to all problems. After all, we have to die sooner, or later, but i want to live when life is still enjoyable in many ways.",t2_52c430k8,False,,0,False,"Going insane?

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have anything that is making me happy. I love my family and my dog. From an outside perspective it probably looks like I’m feeling much better. On the inside I feel empty. I don’t like my friends. I’m lonely as fuck. I don’t enjoy anything I do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suicidal thoughts are returning.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Let me tell the stupid luck in my life that I got. First off, I'm almost 18, I currently only live at my dad's because my parents broke up almost two years ago and I can bear my mother less than my father. I was falsely diagnosed with mild autism at 10 years old, only because I'm very shy with people. They also think I can hardly make friends, but it's just that obviously I'm shy, but I also try to avoid people with stupid behaviours and all resulting in me having few friends... I'm also ugly and I only used to have a girlfriend once when I was 7 until I was 13 because we stupidly forgot each other... I was lucky to even just get one even though it was only a childhood relationship. 

Since I was 10, my parents began treating me more and more like shit until it became impossible to even have a positive thought about them, like being thankful for what they've done, or just even liking them, every time, sometimes they get really horrible with me and they always have a ""reason"" to be like that every time, and then it looks like they get nice for a while to try to make me forget about what they've done before... I have a sister and most of the time, she gets treated well and they literally have a friendship-like relationship and they all try to hide the fact that they favour my sister when it's extremely obvious... Following the next year after my so called ""diagnostic"", I got a school life assistant (not sure if it's really called like that in English-speaking countries as I'm not English), which led to me getting bullied as people thought I had a handicap for my whole middleschool years, at least now since I got in highschool, I no longer have one, which is way better since it was useless anyway, but people there have been seeming to not give a shit about me, even if they sometimes do and have to care for a moment... 

Since I was 12-13, I began questioning myself about my life, and it led to me becoming a female trans (Male to Female for those confused) almost two years ago and since I began questioning myself on those things, I felt like god truly began to fully hate me and shit even more on my life and my destiny, because of course god thought ""oH dAmN ShE's beCoMinG tRanS, tHaT's aS """"bAd"""" As bEinG gAy LiKe hOw hUmANs sTaTEd tHaT i hATe lGbTq+ iN mY BiBlE, lEt'S pUnISh hEr bY mAKiNg hEr LiFe wOrSe hAHaHa"". Since then, my life has been even worse, my grades, especially in Maths and Sciences began to get bad, the only subject I'm good in is in English and my grades are still generally the same nowadays. I've been wanting to study in computer sciences, and I've decided I'll try to become a Web Developper, but with how my Maths and Sciences grades are bad, I'm pretty sure there won't be any school accepting me to study for that kind of job...

I first came out to my best friend about me being trans and then to my sister, about a little more than a year and they both accepted me and recently, I came out to my dad, and as expected, he reacted kinda badly although he was at first silent about it, but then he pretty much acted like those parents who claim they know everything and because I have no partner and have had no experience in there, he claimed that I am not trans like if it actually had a link to transexuality and gender identities... And since then, he still refers to me as a guy and he gets very transphobic when he's talking about me and also since I'm a ""guy"", he still thinks he's allowed to be violent towards me. I can still somehow get long nails altough he makes transphobic comments on them when he notices they get long enough, but at least, I managed to get a wig thanks to my sister. I don't wanna live with my mom because she's traumatised me because she once got so violent with me to the point of tearing up my pajama top of hitting my door with a hammer once (there were holes in the door after that). My mom probably doesn't know about me being trans yet. I don't know if my dad will want to kick me out someday after turning 18...

I also kinda fell in love with my best and only friend, because he's the only one who I can count on who won't tell my dad at some occasions unlike my sister and he's the only one who's there for me...

And today... I noticed I'm losing my hair that I've been wanting to grow, guess who wanted that again? It's god of course yet again, he's transphobic, so he gotta make sure my life is shitty by making it worse by making events like that! Oh damn do I love my misery life... I have no clue if my dad will even help me recover my hair although he's kinda poor...

And now I'm wondering yet again if it's even worth it to stay alive and get even more shits to land on my face while having a very slim chance of fully transitioning, getting a normal life again, doing the kind of job I want to do, and being with the man I've known for so long... I'm such a coward I know I won't easily kill myself and I know my death will sadden my best friend and my sister, but my parents will probably not care much about it... What have I done wrong to get such a poor life?

My life is currently so fucked I feel like doing nothing not even eating. I just sit at home being depressed af. 

A year ago life was much better had a friend group, we’d be doing stuff, partying and just hanging out. Now it all changed they either moved away or don’t really meet anymore. 

I don’t even have anyone to talk to, I messaged a friend saying I’m depressed af, and he replied couple hours later saying he was busy. A childhood friend that we’ve been bestfriends forever. But I guess not anymore. 

My life currently is so dead because I’m kind of alone and I hate being so alone. Im just about living but honestly I currently hate life and each day I dread the fucking pain. I hate being this depressed I like being happy and laughing and enjoying life. 

I want to give life a chance and my question is how can I get better? I’m supposed to start some therapy shit soon but it won’t change my life for better. 

What can I do to change my life? How do I meet friends? I’m not the best at making new friends because I have some what social anxiety but it’s not severe, but I’m just unsure how to even make new friends. I’m 22 btw so I’m not even at school anymore. 

Maybe I can go travelling? I love travelling and I’d love to go somewhere to travel and maybe meet people that way. I live in UK, but I’d love to go somewhere really foreign like for example India and meet new people from different cultures . Maybe I’d see the world from a different perspective and maybe I could meet some great people that way. But idk how to even travel I don’t have that much money I have saved up currently like £3000 and maybe I could use that money to actually change my life up as that will be literally priceless.

I've lost more weight than I should have, and they tell me I'm very thin, but I hardly feel like eating. The doctor has sent me orfidal pills, which leave me very sleepy during the day and leave me awful to do my job.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like my job, but it has been difficult for me to get it, and I save because I don't have anyone else to help me and I need to be able to pay for a house and not see how they throw me out in a few years to die under a bridge. Every day I get worse. Between anxiety and medication, it is difficult for me to keep up and I have to spend many hours to be able to reach deadlines and even so they have already given me a couple of talks. And I smell that the following will already be a dismissal

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to drink, and I would be drinking beer or whiskey all day, and I force myself not to because unfortunately I have had family who have traveled that road and I know how badly they ended up. So I just have a couple of drinks on Sunday nights to try and get some sleep from Sunday to Monday. If I didn't force myself not to, I'd be drunk all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends, the few that I have gotten to have I have been losing over time, either because they form their own family and continue their life, or because of their distancing from my problems. It is very nice to say that in the world there are many problems of depression or suicide, but nobody wants to be touched by any of that closely or to know anything about the people who suffer from it.

Someone I have never spoken to on snapchat told me but my own fucking mother hasn’t. How saddening is that. But she did come in my room this morning to rudely tell me to do my homework and clean my room. Even last night she was extremely rude to me and talked to me in a bad tone. She told me how she buys me everything I want when I asked her to knock before coming in my room because i was on the phone with my friends. She has done a lot more this isn’t the first time and I’m getting to my breaking point. I thought of su1c1de for the first time in a while Tuesday night.

,depression,"
I apologize in advance this is gonna be so long and  chaotic i have so much bottled up and need to let it out and sorry for my englisch it’s not my first language. 

So the last time i vented on reddit was 2 years ago when i was at, i think, my lowest point in life. I’m now 17 and going on here again kinda sucks cause I’m at the same mental state i was in when i was 15. The only progress i made during that time was that i stopped worrying about my appearance as much. Of course i still get those thoughts that I’m ugly sometimes but it’s really not that serious. I even started taking pictures of myself which might not sound like a big deal but from the ages 11-16 i never took any  pics of myself because i felt so ugly and felt like i ruined every picture.

Other then that nothing has changed. I still feel like shit. I literally think about killing myself every second of the day 7 days a week. Idk if I’m weird for saying it but the thought of suicide is comforting in a way?? Like knowing that if everything goes downhill i still can escape anytime by killing myself. I wouldn’t do it tho. Even tho i might feel like im so unlovable and unwanted i know that i have people in my life who love me. And thats what makes me so mad is that i know that im not alone but my brain just refuses to really see that. Thats why i wish i was completely alone so that i can end my life. I know thats fucked because there are people out there who actually have no one but here i am being privileged enough to have family and friends but wishing i didn’t. I really hate myself for thinking that way. 

Speaking of friends: my best friend of 7 years i think has been really cold and weird for the past months. In school he didn’t even look at me, he ignored my messages and a few days ago he just blocked me and since then we haven’t talked. I texted him on Snapchat asking why tf he blocked me but he ignored it. Im not blocked anymore since yesterday but he hasn’t texted me. Idk what i did tho. It sucks when your fav person just leaves u. And this isn’t the first time someone left me like that lol. 

I just feel like I’m losing everyone around me cause im too busy hating myself that i completely isolate myself. I thought i was getting better but turns out im just really good at ignoring my problems and distracting myself because i know that if i start thinking about how much i hate myself and my life i break down. But I get so angry and frustrated at the most insignificant things and then i let it out on my family and friends. Well either that or i go completely numb. Yesterday was the first time in forever since I’ve cried but then a few minutes later i got completely numb i really hate feeling that way. 

I stopped doing the things i like. I don’t even have the energy to watch anime anymore. I just lay in bed and sleep and i always feel so guilty afterwards. Well i feel guilty for feeling like that in general cause i know there are people who have it 10x worse than me.

And i hope i don’t sound dumb saying that but no one will ever notice how I’m feeling. Because my friends know me as someone who’s always making jokes, always carefree, confident etc. and they even said im cold hearted which is just not true lol. But i would never reach out to any of my friends because well first of all i wanna keep that picture that they have of me cause maybe I’ll start believing it too and start acting that way. And second of all i don’t wanna be a burden to them. I don’t want them to think that they HAVE to do something because there’s nothing they could do thats gonna cure me and i know how frustrating that is and i don’t want them to go through it. But sometimes i really need someone. I’m trying to convince myself i can do this by my own but i can’t. At least not always. If i do open up to someone which rarely happens i regret it afterwards.

the thing i noticed it that i feel weirdly comfortable in my suffering. Like i feel weird when I’m genuinely happy for a while. It feels like something is missing. I feel like theres a part of me thats missing.

,depression,"I've never written on one of these before, but I just feel maybe I should finally talk about how I've felt my entire life. I am 23 and suffer from Major Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, mild alcohol use disorder and a whole bunch of additional things on my medical record. Throughout my entire life all I knew was loss and feeling of aloneness. I never adequately developed relationships with anyone close to me until I grew older and had relationships (all never worked out). I grew up in a single parent household with my mother and brother who both weren't present because he's almost 10 years older than me and my mom worked excessive hours to pay the bills so i was always alone.

 My mother is an alcoholic and just turned 9 years sober, whereas my brother is exceeding her footsteps (i struggle with alcholism as well and fortunately have only drank twice in 15 months since February 7th, 2020). I first went to therapy in 2nd grade but ended that for reasons I repressed. From a child I witnessed my brother overdose and various suicide attempts that I would watch him become unresponsive and be dead until brought back and also witnessed my mother overdose and try to take her own life all before I was 13. I remember vividly going sleepless and proceeding going to school the next day and pretend nothing happened. The first time I tried to take my own life I was 8 years old and hung myself but my mother stopped it from finishing. As years passed by I began noticing how life kept throwing hardships at me and everyone around me would be experiencing proud moments whereas I felt I was getting shitted on no matter how hard I tried to change my outcomes. When I was 15 I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety after my girlfriend at the time convinced me I should go take the ""black box test"" because I confided in her how I truly felt. Counseling never worked for me from group sessions to various therapists i never felt adequate there. I have stuck with my psychiatrist since I was 15 and the only adult patient she has. I have also been on over 25 different antidepressants in the last 8 years. None of which worked besides giving me substantial side effects.

 I have been around drugs and alcohol abuse my entire life and told myself i would not follow my family's ways but as I got older and it became more obtainable I caved in. When I was 19 I started to get into drinking and experimenting with drugs. As my friends would casually drink I noticed it was harder for me to limit myself and my self control would be diminished. As I turned 21 and I could go out and drink i would have to persuade my friends to go drink with me and buy them alcohol just so i wouldn't feel alone

. I moved to another town for my final year of undergraduate college after my college where I had been working on getting into since I was 16 shutdown my junior year (1st year after two years of community College). Here I began drinking every day and would go to class hungover or smelling like booze just to repeat the process everyday until I graduated. 
When applying for my masters a couple days later I was arrested for a DUI and dealt with losing everything in that process that made my mental health significantly worse. My school gave me the opportunity to go into the program for Art Therapy but I am on very restricted guidelines and have a much harder time finishing things because of background checks. 

Since I was arrested i only drank twice (once was my great grandfather's death anniversary and on Halloween when my ex girlfriend and me got into an argument).  
Me and my ex girlfriend were long distance, and she was there for my legal stuff aswell as dealing with her mother's health declining and eventually going into a coma and eventually passing away from covid. I am still in love with her and i know she has moved on. I was not there for her emotionally because i couldn't due to my own struggles and dealing with health problems as well. It's one of the biggest regrets I have and i failed as a partner for her because I'm an issue myself and i need to acknowledge it. 

Within the first month or my master's program my great grandmother passed away and school was not helpful with it. My great grandparents practically raised me as i spent all my school breaks and summers with them until my great grandfather passed away in 2011 (me amd my brother were his caregivers as he was blind and phsycially limited due to a stroke when I was 2). This took a huge toll on me and shitty enough I got covid a couple weeks later. Covid nearly killed me and doctors would not allow me to seek proper help because it would risk others so IV fluids and additional services I needed to potentially help me were not allowed. This took a lot of damage onto my lungs and body physically. Since then I am now considered a long-hauler and have neurological damage as well as my mental state being at it's very worst. My hands are in so much pain and i have severe tremors which makes creating art unbearable. My right side of my body lost significant strength and mobility and my nerves and nervous system are struggling tremendously. 

I am in so much emotional and physical pain my occupational, physical, speech, osteopathic doctor, and other doctors all have subtly agreed that as a 23 year old I got ""fucked up"" to the point Ive been doing things stroke patients over twice my age practice for rehabilitation. I stuttered tremendously as a child and would get made fun of and now it has came back as well as my left eye twitching and drooping at times. I never self cut until a couple months ago and each time i notice it requires more and more to feel a relief. I went from my arms to my throat and the scars make me feel worse about myself because i get looks wherever i go but i can't help it. I would overdose on benadryl nearly everyday by taking large quantities in November, but my body would just go into shock and have respiratory struggles until id pass out. 

These last couple of months I've been more suicidal than I've been even while using substances. I feel like such a burden to everyone and have failed as a sibling, partner, friend, and person in this world. I truly wish i could give my life to someone who genuinely wishes to continue living.

Really recently I realized I’ve been losing events in my memory. I’m only 22. 

I texted my mom the other day apologizing like crazy that I never went over for Easter when she calls me confused because I did... I literally have her basket in my car. I didn’t remember going. At all. I can’t remember the past two christmases or my birthday (not the day. But what all I did or didn’t do.) for context. I don’t drink, smoke, anything. And it’s terrifying me. I’ve been having arguments with my boyfriend because I’d be upset when he insisted he told me something and I was convinced he never did. 

I’m literally forgetting conversations and today we were talking and he went “you told me this 20 minutes ago. And twice yesterday.” And i just kinda stopped because I don’t know what to do. He thinks it’s stress and I’ll be okay when we’re in a less stressful time. Which yes I have been stressed but this isn’t the worst I’ve been stressed. And I don’t THINK I was having this issue before. At least with not me forgetting super recent things. I forgot he canceled a whole flight and was convinced he was going to be leaving for it and I still remember things in general and it’s just really messing with me right now. 

I have a doctors appointment next Tuesday and I called to make one and she said I already scheduled one. I literally have no memory calling to schedule one for this.

,depression,"A little bit of context to better understand my situation :

- I’m in the second year of my Computer Scientist apprenticeship i also do a « Federal Vocational Baccalaureate » (degree that will allow me to enter without exams in the Engineering school). 

- I altern between the periods (2-5 months) of school and those of work.

So, since the beginning of the School year I’m feeling depressed and my grades have significantly dropped. I was happy to go to my December-May work period (i thought it would be easier) but thanks to covid, I’m teleworking since February. It was already hard for me to focus at work, but it’s almost impossible at home and let’s be honest i barely work.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and she prescribed me Sertralin (antidepressant) and Temesta (benzodiazepines). I didn’t took the antidepressant because their side effects (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, loss of appetite, dizziness, excessive tiredness, nervousness) are already something I’m going through everyday. And the benzo are in case of another panick attack.

I’m going back to school the 17th,I feel overwhelmed by all the projects and assignments that I was unable to do all that time. Even if I wanted it would be useless to start taking my medication now because i couldn’t handle the side effects listed before.

I thought about asking my psychiatrist for a medication to solve my lack of concentration. I tried Ritalin today, and it helped me a lot but I don’t think she would be okay with prescribing ADHD meds for someone who isn’t diagnosed with it.

So my question is, which kind of medication can help me ?

The weak breeze whispers nothing
the water screams sublime.
His feet shift, teeter-totter
deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.

Eyes locked shut but peek to see
the view from halfway down.
A little wind, a summer sun
a river rich and regal.
A flood of fond endorphins
brings a calm that knows no equal.
You’re flying now, you see things
much more clear than from the ground.
It's all okay, or it would be

Thrash to break from gravity

All I’d give for toes to touch

The reason I’m trying this out is because a lot of times when I’m dealing with emotional stress and other issues I like to go online and find other people that are going through difficult times as well. Hopefully I can connect with someone going through a similar situation as me. Anyways, a little about me. I’ll be drinking age soon. I’m currently in college (everything’s online). I’m actually really considering dropping out because I don’t have an actual goal in mind of what career I want to get into. People always tell me that that’s okay, that a lot of people change majors multiples times in college. That’s cool and everything, but it doesn’t take away the feeling that I’m wasting my time and money on something I’m not motivated to do. I want to be able to get a good job in the future, and I know that going go to college will make it easier for me, but so far all I’ve taken are some prerequisite classes that I hate doing. I just want spring term to end. Anyways, that’s not the point of this so moving on. I live with only 1 of my parents, my other parent has been absent for about 5 years. Growing up, my parents would fight a lot. It got to the point of physical and emotional abuse; I won’t bore you with the details, but my parents tried to fix their issues and they never could, so one of them decided to leave and that explains why I only live with one. With a dysfunctional family like this, they really aren’t the people that I would open up to. I love them and everything, but it just doesn’t feel right. Growing up this took a toll on younger me. Some days I would really dread having to come home to fighting and yelling. I think this explains why as a kid, I really loved school. It was a place where I could escape from my house and I could laugh and have fun with all my friends and forget about the things that happened at home. I was probably the only kid that felt downright miserable on the last day of school. This little trait of mine even followed me into high school, and on the day of graduation, it was super hard for me to accept that I was never going back to the place where I found solace as a kid. A lot of people really enjoy the idea of “freedom” that comes with graduating, but I rarely leave my house or go to parties or social events, so to me this “freedom” is really just me feeling so incredibly bored, feeling aimless, sometimes hopeless, with no real support system, no promising future to look forward to, really nothing at all. I can’t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or if I’ve ever been happy to begin with. It was during this gloomy time of my life that started talking to someone I met online. At first I was just looking for something to ease the boredom, but as time went on I found that I actually really enjoyed talking to this person. They were funny, caring, sweet, just a really great person overall. And it didn’t hurt that they were attractive too lol. We started talking more and more and it got to the point one day where we both confessed we had feelings for each other. I always thought LDRs were weird and I didn’t see how someone could be in one, but there I was, actually getting into one lol. I actually felt for once that I could say I was happy. But like many other LDRs, it didn’t last. We broke things off and stopped talking for bit. I don’t know if the person reading this has ever experienced something like that, but when you get really used to having someone in your life, and one day they abruptly get up and leave, it really sucks. Really really sucks. If I felt hopeless and alone before, you can imagine how I was feeling then. I had someone in my life that genuinely made my days so much better and they were gone. The best way I can describe it is just emptiness. A numb feeling in your whole body that makes you lose the motivation to do anything at all.

I felt like that for a week or two until told myself I would move on.

It was around this time that me and the person talked things out between us and we agreed that we would continue talking just as friends. That was a while back. We’re still talking today but there’s still something that really troubles me. I’ve realized that my mood is really dependent on that person. If we talk normally I find myself feeling fine, but if days go by where we don’t really talk I find myself feeling agitated and anxious. I’m scared to lose them again. So basically my “happiness” depends on them, and I don’t know what to do.

Since breaking up with my ex around September last year, quitting my job and absolutely shutting myself in, I have not cleaned my room once or even attempted to.

I dumped all of the bags of clothes on my bedroom floor and said to mum “I’ll pack later.” It’s now been 8 months and a lot of the bags have been searched through by me, to find something specific then leave everything in a huge mess. The only floor space in my room is the entry from the doorway to my bed. I feel so bad for my poor mother having to walk past my shit storm of a room every single day, I can’t imagine how helpless she feels because her 20 year old child won’t do anything about it.

,depression,"***TRIGGER WARNING - mentions of suicide/death










So last night me and my gf got in an argument. I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and ideation. I haven’t gone as far as making a plan for it or anything because I’m scared of the pain of death. So during this argument I mention that I don’t want to be here anymore and I just can’t do it several times (having a meltdown), and she says the following:

“You’re talking about it which means you want help. I’ve been suicidal before and I just got quiet. People who are really going to do it don’t talk about it, they just get quiet.” - this may not be exactly word for word but it’s 95% accurate. 

After that, I became extremely hurt because that statement made it seem like since I’m talking about it then it means I’m not really gonna do it and I felt like it Implies that experience is not at “authentic” as someone who “is really gonna do it”. I tried to explain to her that the statement IMPLIES that my experience with suicide is not real or as important or serious as someone who has a plan and commits to it. She just kept telling me I was twisting her words when I didn’t. I believe most people put priority on what’s IMPLIED by a statement or question over what the statement or question LITERALLY says.

,depression,"I’ve been at this depression/anxiety thing for a while, and it’s wearing on me. By most measures I’ve got a pretty good life, I just don’t know how to be happy anymore. The isolation and loneliness are starting to get to me I guess, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it. I just get up, work most of the day, maybe goof off on Xbox or something for a bit if I have time, and I sleep. There’s no break from the pattern, it’s constant, and I feel like it’s slowly killing me. 

I feel selfish for even feeling this way because so many people have more on their plate. My stress doesn’t come from money, or family, or relationships, I’m just never happy anymore. I try to talk to people sometimes but everyone just gives me the same general response of “You don’t have shit to worry about, why are you depressed?”.

By most measures I’ve got a pretty good life, I just don’t know how to be happy anymore. The isolation and loneliness are starting to get to me I guess, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it. I just get up, work most of the day, maybe goof off on Xbox or something for a bit if I have time, and I sleep. There’s no break from the pattern, it’s constant, and I feel like it’s slowly killing me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel selfish for even feeling this way because so many people have more on their plate. My stress doesn’t come from money, or family, or relationships, I’m just never happy anymore. I try to talk to people sometimes but everyone just gives me the same general response of “You don’t have shit to worry about, why are you depressed?”. I wish I knew the answer, or how to fix it, but I don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
