,Anxiety,"Hey guys or gals so I’m on day 11 of Lexapro and it is a game changer. I’ve had severe severe anxiety for about a year and everyday was a constant battle... I was afraid of the dark and couldn’t sleep earlier then 7am and it was destroying my social life.. I started taking Lexapro and the first week was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. My already debilitating anxiety was like 3x worse I was having a constant panic attack for hours out of each day. I was experiencing insomnia, upset stomach, dizziness, sweats etc. But I decided to stick it out because I know this can happen. Suddenly day 8 roles around I take my pill and something was different the side effects completely went away and I slept like 6 hours. Ever since day 8 everything has been getting better and the length of sleep is increasing. I’m struggling to figure out if it was completely the pill or the fact that I’m forcing myself to go for walks etc but my life has changed almost overnight... I’m going to sleep no later then 12 at night with minimal anxiety.

I’ve had severe severe anxiety for about a year and everyday was a constant battle... I was afraid of the dark and couldn’t sleep earlier then 7am and it was destroying my social life.. I started taking Lexapro and the first week was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. My already debilitating anxiety was like 3x worse I was having a constant panic attack for hours out of each day. I was experiencing insomnia, upset stomach, dizziness, sweats etc. But I decided to stick it out because I know this can happen. Suddenly day 8 roles around I take my pill and something was different the side effects completely went away and I slept like 6 hours. Ever since day 8 everything has been getting better and the length of sleep is increasing. I’m struggling to figure out if it was completely the pill or the fact that I’m forcing myself to go for walks etc but my life has changed almost overnight... I’m going to sleep no later then 12 at night with minimal anxiety. Don’t get me wrong I still get a little anticipatory anxiety for the night but once it’s time I’m way to tired to give a crap.. just wanted to share my story for those struggling with the side effects and who are debating quitting I’m telling you stick it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also sorry for the grammar not a great writer... I’m also a 21m and I’m taking 10mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have just moved to a new area and my anxiety had flared up again. I decided to book a telephone consultation with my new doctor to discuss some options. As many of you know, it takes more than 3 minutes to describe symptoms.

I explained my blood pressure is an issue as I can not stand up without going dizzy and my veins pop out of my hands on a regular basis, suggesting unregulated blood pressure. The doctor snapped 'there is no way for you to know that, you need to come in and get checked' yeah I know this. You told me to do it over the phone. 

I then talked about my palpatations and he offered me a number for CBT. I explained CBT did not work when I last tried, I again explained about my issues with being social for the doctor to tell me I'm repeating myself.

&lt;p&gt;I explained my blood pressure is an issue as I can not stand up without going dizzy and my veins pop out of my hands on a regular basis, suggesting unregulated blood pressure. The doctor snapped &amp;#39;there is no way for you to know that, you need to come in and get checked&amp;#39; yeah I know this. You told me to do it over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then talked about my palpatations and he offered me a number for CBT. I explained CBT did not work when I last tried, I again explained about my issues with being social for the doctor to tell me I&amp;#39;m repeating myself. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I dread spending time with my family. I have nothing against my family. I have no legitimate reason to. I simply dont get along with them and i dont enjoy their company, like when you are forced in a group project with students you never talk to because you dont get along, thats what it feels like. In life we usually have a choice who we spend time with and are friends with but with family its different, i cant just pick and choose who im blood related to. In social situations i feel so pressured to speak and be present. Im still young and live at my moms house, just me and her and she often goes to see her boyfriend so im alone most of the time, when she is home i feel no pressure to be social and be her company. I feel comfortable and relaxed knowing i can stroll around and do my thing. 

Tomorrow is my grandpas birthday and i happily see him and grandma to wish him happy birthday. Im okey spending an hour or so with family, but when it gets to 5..6..7 hours of keeping up i cant stand it. The fake smile hurts my jaw and gives a throbbing headeache which is probably when the anxiety is taking over. Not knowing what to say, fake laughing at their jokes, listening to their gossip, pretending im feeling fine and like i want to be there is awful. And then knowing my dad and his girlfriend is taking me to their house afterwards so i can stay over extends that even more. Its not like moms house, there i feel fine, comfortable in my bubble. Going to dads house is like im ”going to see dad” i feel like i have to constantly show face and be present and keep a conversation up and going and be entertaining 24/7. I cant help but feel like this is my last day of peace until i have to spend a full day with those people, potentially even longer because im taken to dads house. When i know times like this are coming up i spend every day feeling moody, stressed out, sensitive and close to tears because i know how emotionally draining it is and how badly i want it over with before its even started. When holidays are over i usually go in my room and cry, with thoughts of how weird, lonely, misunderstood and drained i feel. I hate to see people take it personal, i see how it looks that way when i never visit my dad for example, but its really not. I have nothing against anybody its just so emotionally draining and i have always felt like an outsider like the black sheep in my family, it gives me anxiety like the last thing i want is to be in that moment. Im sure somebody can relate to this. What can i do in situations like this, when all i really want is to escape the scene i cant just do that without looking like an asshole. I cant just leave and escape the scene but i feel dumb sitting there completely silent with a throbbing headache close to tears with a big fake smile on my face. I dont know which is worse to not show up, to deal with it for an hour just to show face and then slowly get away from the scene to sit in another room..alone, or to feel like an idiot, silent with crippling anxiety at the dinner table where it all happens but look somewhat polite and normal for blending in?

Here's the scoop:

Even though I started out as a contract worker, my boss told me she would put me on salary by August of 2020. (That was one reason I accepted the position.) When that didn't happen, she told me it would be by January 2021. When that didn't happen, she told me we needed to wait on a few more clients to sign before she could do that. Don't get me wrong... she's tried to do right by me. She gave me a raise, an insurance stipend, and vaca pay. I truly think she's generous and is doing the best she can. But then.... a few weeks ago my paycheck bounced. (She sent me the money via Venmo, but let's face it... that's a red flag.) A couple weeks after that, she told me that she wouldn't be able to pay me the same time every month anymore because she needed to make sure the clients paid before she paid our team. Again, I get it. The world has been crazy. A global pandemic hasn't helped. Businesses go through these periods. However, I need security. I'm the only person left in my biological family. I need to make sure that I'm going to be okay. 

So, I started applying for jobs. I got an offer at a respectable company. They are starting me out at $11,000/year more than I'm currently making. It just makes sense. Today, I told my boss. I also told her that I'd still be available to help her out part time if necessary, and that this isn't personal... it's just what I need to do to make sure I'm taken care of. She responded with a very short email, told me that this is very unexpected and that we would talk on Monday.

Cue my anxiety. My people-pleasing mind hates that she feels this way. My codependent nature wants to hold her hand through this. But when I look at it from a logical perspective, I understand that I have nothing to feel bad about. I did what I needed to do. I gave her as much notice as I possibly could. I still offered to work with her and help her through the transition. I don't know what else I could have done differently, aside from not accepting this new, amazing, perfect-for-me job.

My partner and I both were fortunate enough to get one dose of vaccine but where I live the virus is extremely out of control and we are not fully protected so I’m still scared.

,Anxiety,"# The Wind, One Brilliant Day

*by Antonio Machado*

The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.

""In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.""

""I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.""

""Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.""

The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself: ""What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?""

,Anxiety,"I have GAD and a huge anxiety trigger for me is sleep. Last night I slept for 2 hours and then woke up off and on for the rest of the night. I think I'm adjusting to my new dosage of Zoloft but I'm having such a fucking hard time. I should be exhausted from my shitty night, but I feel like I drank too much caffeine and am losing my shit. I can't muster myself up to take my dog out or exercise, though I know it would be helpful and would probably burn off some of my energy. I know I'll probably have another bad night of sleep and anxiety attacks tonight and it's really traumatic for both me and my partner when this happens. I'm just so frustrated because since starting medication 6.5 weeks ago it's been a rollercoaster, but last week I thought I'd finally found the right dose and felt great. It was so amazing to just feel calm, with little to no anxiety, great decision-making skills, and feel like my ""old self"" before my disorder started. I've felt my anxiety slowly ramping up over the past several days and today it's terrible. I can't focus on anything. It takes so much mental work to just get up, brush my hair, shower, and get dressed. Thankfully I'm off work until Tuesday, because idek how I'd work in this state. I'm all by myself and can't focus on books, movies, activities, chores, etc. I've just been more or less laying down for several hours, taking tiny steps to get the tiniest things done, like a shower and getting dressed. I just feel like my whole life is a shitshow and every time I get a little relief from my anxiety it disappears as soon as I feel like I'm starting to heal. I have all this free time and it would be great to be able to get things done, but all I can do is think about how fucking anxious I am.

,Anxiety,"I'm 23 F and I have worked in 10 places already. In restaurants, stores, big manufacturing companies, small family ones too.

 I hated every day working in each place. 

Just a thought about waking up every day at 6, doing ""important"" stuff on bosse's command, dealing and cooperating with coworkers makes me sick. 
I'm an engineer already and doing my Master's right now. I don't mind studying at University, I don't love it, I don't despise it, I'd rather study than work.

I know after graduation I will be forced to go to the worked by life. I need money to live. 

But every thought about working anywhere makes my body, mind and soul sick. After panicking I have to lay down under the blanket for a few hours, watch tv series and brainwash myself out of the negative thoughts by bombing my brain with TV or Internet crap.

The only things that make me happy are dancing, doing sports, painting, cooking, taking care of my house or garden, hanging out with family and friends, slowly going through life. I want to be stay at home mome one day, have a lot of kids and the care of my family. Just imagine a typical wife in 1950s that is a nurturing stay at home mother taking care of her house while her husband provides for a family. That's the life I'm made for, not the work environment. 

When I'm in any type of rush my adrenaline spikes and anxiety hits. I need to slow everything down to feel in peace. Any type of rush just destroys me. That's one of the reasons why working makes my body sick. I don't tolerate any types of stress.

,Anxiety," I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life, and I'm pretty sure I have at least mild BPD because I just cannot seem to control my emotions when I get upset. I am 34 and this has been going on most of my life; I have sought treatment more times than I can remember and am on three different meds to manage my anxiety and depression.  


But I still get into these situations where I'm incredibly stressed and frustrated, and I end up completely losing it in public - usually on the street/sidewalk, but sometimes I have ""freakouts"" in stores, restaurants, etc. Most of the time I just scream at the top of my lungs and hit myself in the face repeatedly while saying crazy things - basically just an adult temper tantrum. I suppose it must feel cathartic in the moment, but it's extremely embarrassing afterward. I have a running list now of places (stores, restaurants, etc) I can no longer go because I had an adult temper tantrum in public and am too ashamed to go back.  


Even worse, this keeps happening at home in my apartment complex - just this morning, I slept through my alarm and was running super late to work, so I screamed and hit myself in the face right outside my building at around 7 in the morning. Just the other day, my smoke detector wouldn't stop beeping, and I didn't know how to turn it off, so I started screaming at the top of my lungs ""STOP!! STOP!! STOP!!"" (also very early in the morning) - eventually I just had to take out the batteries and snip the wires - now I'm too embarrassed to even put in a work order to fix/replace it. And I'm sure all my neighbors know who I am by now - ""that crazy guy with the dog who's always yelling.""

,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,
Last year around October/November I had a big day recreationally using cocaine and ended up calling an ambulance thinking I was having a heart attack. 
Once in hospital they didn't give me much information but my bloods came back ok, chest Xray ok and they monitored me for around 5hrs and I was fine. 

That was enough to scare me and I haven't touched anything besides alcohol (rarely drink just socially) I even quit smoking. 

Since then I've been having chest pains on and off. Most days. As well as a heaviness in my right arm and a pain in my right leg that's sort of feels like an electric shock. ( lasts no more than 1 second)

I could be at work and happily doing a task im confident in when it hits me or I could be at home sitting on the couch watching TV when the pains occur. 

After multiple visits with my GP (I told him everything) he sent me to get an echocardiogram and that came back ok. I've also had an ultrasound and besides a slightly fatty liver (which he said isn't to worry about at the moment) everything is ok.
My blood pressure is a little elevated 130/82 at the doctors. However I monitor myself at home and usually under normal numbers.
He ended up prescribing me Mertazapine thinking I have anxiety (which I may have but im not convinced). 
I even went and saw a psychiatrist once but didn't feel like I was getting anything im generally a pretty positive and happy person, a problem solver and I feel happy. 

I was on mertazapine for at least 3 months and been to the ER 2 times with chest pains in that time. Once on my own while having chest pains at work and once by doctors orders after my description on my chest pains and family history worried him
Both times chest xrays and bloods came back ok.

While on mertazapine my pains never stopped and I was sleeping way too much, personality completely changed and gained so much weight probably at least 20kg. It honestly was not making me happy. 
I was late to work almost every day because I couldn't get enough sleep. 

I've stopped using it since I decided it wasn't for me. My GP told me to slowly dose off but I did it pretty quickly as I hated the person it made me. I've been off for around 3 weeks. 

My sharp leg pain is the one that mostly bothers me. It feels to me like a blocked artery but im no doctor. The chest pain and arm is mostly pretty dull but noticeable and it does worry me. 

Im just wondering if anyone else has been under any similar situation. Should I be pushing my doctor more towards something is wrong with my arteries/heart since my chest pain and leg pain hasn't stopped or should I be looking for a new anxiety medication?

Is there another test or something I can ask my doctor to do as the pain in my leg honestly feels to me like something is blocked up.

The mertazapine made me so unfit and has probably caused anxiety with the weight gain if anything. Weight is something I used to struggle with when I was younger and took me 10 years to loose the weight. I've gained the weight that took me 10 years to loose and keep off in a short time frame.

Anybody with any advice would be great.
Im honestly unsure if its just anxiety or if I may have a medical condition.

,Anxiety,"I don’t really have a true point in posting this I guess but to let things out. Today I had to leave work AGAIN after leaving last week and a couple weeks before that because I had another panic attack. I was put on medicine two years ago that was working really well but just recently within the last couple months I could feel me slipping deeper into my anxiety. I’ve had the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had in my life and it’s been a cluster of them lately. I feel bad about leaving work because I feel they really don’t understand that I cannot control how my brain is firing.

,Anxiety,"So I've recently come to terms with the idea that I most likely have anxiety. For years I've been frequently cold and shaky despite it actually being warm, and I never really feel comfortable - not when I sleep, not in the shower, not in my bedroom, not even on the toilet. It's the same in social situations as it is when I'm in my house. It's increased particularly due to a couple events recently where I have been threatened and physically assaulted by the same group twice.

I very much want help with this. In-person help very much ideally. I went to my GP early last year because I felt anxious, and I described to him how I was suicidal, how I've attempted before, how I always feel anxious, how I spent 20% of my time away from school in Year 11 because I didn't feel confident enough to go in. He told me to write down my feelings and burn the paper after, and sent me a text to a charity called OTR. Here's the issue - the former solution helps in the short-term but doesn't actually stop my anxiety, and the latter solution has a wait list up to, and maybe surpassing, a year.

I can talk to my parents, I can talk to my girlfriend, but neither are completely helpful. I'll be honest, I've not given my parents much of a chance to help - they don't even know I've felt suicidal in the past. I guess I'm worried of disappointing them or worrying them since all of my siblings bar one has had the same issues and I hate to see my mum worry. My girlfriend, whilst she might try her best, isn't great at comforting. I've tried to help teach her how to comfort me but it's going to be a long process.

I am in college, and so I'm sure I could get counseling there, but I'm in college 3 times a fortnight. I'm not 18 so I don't even qualify for therapy provided by the NHS. 

I really do need help. I don't want to keep feeling like this, nor do I want it to ever get worse again. I just don't know what my options are. I've tried dietary changes, I've tried cutting caffeine (I was off caffeine for 4 months over a year back after years of drinking &gt;10 cups of coffee a day most days, not even soft drinks, and it had no effect), I've tried exercise.

,Anxiety,"I've come a long way in understanding my anxiety, mainly because of meditation and countless self-help books and videos. I've always been prone to anxiety, but this current episode has been worse than anything before and has lasted over 6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I set myself a deadline: since much of my anxiety has stemmed from stomach problems and I dreaded my upcoming colonoscopy, I decided to only try meds if my mood doesn't get better after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though my colonoscopy went fine and nothing truly traumatising happened, it was my first experience with hospitals and I felt so,  so awful during it. I spent 24h sitting on toilet floor, panicking. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel like my ""inner child"" is still crying after it. It's been three days and my anxiety is horrible. Small things cause lots of distress, sofa is my only safe place and going outside horrifies me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed with GAD, and I think I have tendency to emetophobia, agoraphobia and hypochondria. I have a prescription for escitalopram. Since starting SSRI can cause nasty side effects, I plan to start it after the next week, since my school will be over then and I have no responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

,Anxiety,"My older brother is a good person, and I know that. He’s never gotten in trouble at school, he’s been praised at work, he’s respectful, he’s friendly, etc. However, he struggles in school a lot, especially with the pandemic. This is driving me nuts. It seems like all I can think about these days are “is he going to be successful” “is he going to be homeless in the future” “will he be able to get a professional career”.

I feel like they’re is a constant weight on my chest and I want it to just go away so I can breathe and relax. But I can’t. And it’s scary.

,Anxiety,"I’m nervous whether or not to go see someone about my anxiety, I think it has slowly gotten worse and worse but  I don’t want to be one of those people that ‘self-diagnoses’ and wastes peoples time.

Since I started Uni I think my anxiety has doubled down, I have no friends cause I’m too scared to talk to anyone, I skip seminars cause the fear of going in overwhelms me and in lectures I’ll purposely find the most isolated spot in the room to sit so I both don’t have to talk to anyone and won’t get asked questions.

I stand there awkwardly while everyone around me talks to each other and I’m too scared to join in incase I mess up or say the wrong thing.

I don’t know if those feelings of dread and shortness of breath are panic attacks but I’m hesitant to label them that. But I think it’s really starting to affect my life as I’m struggling in uni and I’ve had to quit my first ever job cause I’m too scared to go back.

,Anxiety,"I have this feeling of impending doom / death anxiety &amp; like I’ll have a certain time in mind and it just freaks me out and I start getting deja vu and it feels like the impending doom / derealization put together and I dont know how to make it stop because there’s nothing I can really do it just comes randomly. Tomorrow is my birthday and I can’t get the thought out of my head that I’m gonna die at 12:00 and this probably all sounds stupid but I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore and I’m getting chest pains and my legs &amp; feet just start cramping. This and more of my anxiety has literally taken over my life. I don’t tell anyone because I’m scared three will invalidate me or that my problems aren’t as bad as other peoples so they’ll think I’m looking for attention. I don’t know how to feel at this point. Today I woke up feeling really shitty, in the afternoon I started getting intrusive and suicidal thoughts but I didn’t do anything (I usually self harm or do something irrational when I’m angry), then I felt productive and got my room clean &amp; now my anxiety feels like it’s about to skyrocket. I felt like my sugar was high (diabetic) and I felt shitty so I took way too much insulin and I’m probably gonna be fucked up later tonight &amp; everything is freaking me out but it’s like I’m numb to it by now. I’m used to the feeling of this and I’m honestly sick of it. I just want to live my life without overthinking, over analyzing, anxiety, derealization, intrusive thoughts, health problems &amp; and everything else. I used to be a very spiritual person so some of my anxiety comes from that or religious ocd because as a kid I was a jehovas witness and I’m seeing a lot of Christians around me. So everything’s just really confusing and I’m scared to make the wrong choice if yk what I mean. I started to overanalyze when I started thinking that every thought in my head was being judged by god or that my thoughts weren’t mine and it was someone communicating to me. Ik it sounds insane but I just don’t wanna have this in the back of my head 24/7. I’m self conscious of myself and I get really paranoid in public (the impending doom thing) and the more I try to fight it the more it consumes me and I’m in complete fear and my thoughts just take over. I don’t know if I know who I am anymore. Everything’s just changing. It’s the worst at night and the pains only add more insult to injury. My breath starts thinning and I start getting scared of my heart stopping or a heart attack or if I’ll just stop breathing. It’s always the worse case scenario for me and it’s getting really tough to handle it on my own. I told my mom about it and she tried to comfort me but I can’t rely on her every time. Plus it’s kind of embarrassing for me to ask for help, I’ve had that problem since I was in elementary school. When I start spiraling I don’t feel like I’m in the real world all I can think about is tragedy and death and it really really fucks with my head because it carries over into the day. I noticed I’m getting more violent and I have more violent thoughts. I feel disconnected from everything. My family, my friends, the world. I lost all motivation and interest in most things I used to love like gaming, basketball, working out. I‘be been pretty much heavily addicted to porn this past year more than normal. It’s slowly sucking the life out of me but somehow I still want more. Like I’m not learning my lesson. It’s forcing me to go to fetishes I probably shouldn’t even know about and it’s robbing me of my innocence. I’m constantly wasting my life and energy on it and it feels like I’ll always be trapped. Like the devil has some hold on me or something and I can t get out of a prison. NF’s Music helped me with the suicidal thoughts and self hatred / harm I was feeling but the problem is still here. For some reason I have this bad habit of running away from the problem or ignoring it or acting like it never existed in the first place but I can’t run forever. This is probably one of my more dumber thoughts but I had this dream where someone broke into my house through my window and I’m getting the impending doom feeling and it’s probably nothing but I just can’t let the thought go. I also can’t forget a dream where my sister shot me and all of this is just kinda freaking me out &amp; I just wanna stop. I haven’t been getting a lot of physical activity and that’s just me being lazy and depressed but it’s taking a toll on my body. I also have a literal chronic disease That’s why it’s so hard to differentiate between health and anxiety if the symptoms are even anxiety. I just don’t feel... safe? Everything feels off and I don’t feel good. I just feel wrong about doing everything. I start getting this feeling that I’m in a simulation and nothing and nobody around me feels real. That’s probably why I feel detached. It really sucks especially when I have low blood sugars because I start to get lightheaded and I start sweating and the pain gets worse then I start getting anxiety after that then it all just manifests into me being burnt out and just done with everything the next day. The reality I’ve come to terms with is that nobodies here for me but my family. But I’m still too scared to tell them anything about my predicament and Like I said I don’t like asking for help so I keep it all in. I’m not even diagnosed so I don’t wanna make a big deal about anything. One of my biggest fears is dying and being forgotten about.

,Anxiety,"I was talking to my parents about how I wanted to eat, (my second meal of the day at midnight) but I knew we were both going to be disappointed in me if I did. Because it’s unhealthy to eat that late and unregulated.

Of course it started a big argument where my mother defend herself, and my father stayed silent except to remind me to be respectful.

I tried talking about how it’s hard for me with my depression and anxiety, (undiagnosed and unmedicated because money,) to wake up at noon and only get the motivation to eat at dinner time. And then to have my desire to eat shot down by my parents because it’s unhealthy. (Really? I didn’t know!) [Edit to clarify: my dad says that eating once a day is fine because I’m getting enough calories and I have enough fat reserves that it can be considered intermittent fasting.]

So then my mom rebutted me and said all of it is my choice. I choose to let my struggles rule my life. (I barely have the motivation to do anything.) Apparently it’s all a choice that I wake up and make every day. And I need to grow up and get a job because I’m now an adult. (I would like to be stable enough to do that!)

Anyway, it all ended with my mom telling me that she never wanted to start an argument over food. And to, “shut up.” (I can hear my mom ranting to my dad about me. And now she’s laughing, probably about how unreasonable I am.) Probably the worst part is that in a few minutes she’s going to come in my room and act all apologetic for yelling. But that’s all she’ll apologize for, if she does at all. [Edit: It’s been almost twenty minutes, she isn’t going to. I can’t decide if that’s worse.]
And my father will ignore the problem and take her side like a good husband.

So, now I’m in my room crying and complaining to the internet anonymously because I can’t talk to anyone about this. And I guess I’m also doing this to block out my intrusive thoughts about h@rm that get hard to ignore when I’m breaking down.

,Anxiety,"Hi, I figured that this subreddit would be the most helpful in finding out my symptoms, thank you to everyone in advance. 

I'm what everyone around me would consider as someone least likely to have anxiety. I'm confident, not afraid to speak up, and overall what they'd describe as ""chill."" I'd I'd say myself that i only sometimes get worried.

But when I do get worried, I would worry to the max.

I start shivering, feeling nauseous or lightheaded or throwing up, cry uncontrollably even when there's really nothing to cry about, feeling like I'm always on the go, m hands start shaking, and my mind start running with different thoughts. I'd even go on panic attacks which will last for hours at my worst. I'd even think think I might die or put myself at risk when I had my worst panic attack. 

I am so confused and am so frustrated with whats happening to me. I've seen people with anxiety before and it look like it just happens without a trigger (I'm sorry if i get this wrong I'm a stranger to anxiety disorders), but I'd always feel this without a fail whenever I get just a little bit worried, which is why I always try to be chill about matters so I won't start having a panic attack out of nowhere. 

I don't like to self diagnose but when someone suggested that I might have anxiety, I initially thought they were just being silly, but then the more I look into it the more the description actually sounds like me. I'd shake uncontrollably even when I'm just overhyped about something and one time I had to go the nurses office because i literally couldn't concentrate since I'm shaking sm.

,Anxiety,"If someone says something that upsets me like they make a negative comment towards me or tell me I’m wrong (when I’m not), how do you just let this go?

Lately, I’ve found that things I didn’t care about or could let go of, now I suddenly care too much about. 

The thing they said is in my mind on repeat 24/7 and it drives me crazy. 

Even one of my comments on a page got 3 downvotes even though the information I provided was correct and I provided my sources and idk it’s triggering me so much. 

The other day someone told me I “need to use commas” on my post instead of periods and I was triggered. I looked through his posts and saw multiple occasions where he used commas INCORRECTLY and it was so hard to not comment on those posts about it. I’m kind of a grammar nerd at heart so this is probably why it triggered me. I’ll admit my grammar isn’t perfect and I do get lazy with punctuation online. But that (now deleted) post he replied to was fine without commas. I’m now just realizing this happened like 3 weeks ago and I’m still thinking about it. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN BY OBSESSING! (I have other occasions where this has happened but I won’t bore you with them all.)

This also can happen if I say something I feel like sounded stupid I won’t stop thinking about what I said. But the majority of the time it’s not what I’ve said and what people say to me. 

I didn’t used to be like this, and I don’t know how to handle it. 

My therapist said to snap myself with a rubber band whenever it happens. Well, I’m not comfortable with inflicting pain on myself to stop thinking about negative things. 

I tell myself that it doesn’t matter what other people think and to just get over it, but it doesn’t work. 

Please no judgement. Since I’ve come off medication due to excessive side effects it’s really hard for me not to be triggered then obsess over things. I don’t know if this is necessarily my ocd or my anxiety (I am diagnosed with both) but I don’t know where else to post where I won’t get attacked because I’m sure r/advice would have a field day and I’d get so much negativity and people would telling me to stop being such a “snowflake”.

I’d also like to include I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2 and am on medication for bipolar. My bipolar meds haven’t been helping with this but when I was on SSRI’s because I was misdiagnosed with depression, they helped with this, but I got too many side effects from them and couldn’t function so I had to stop. 

Sorry this post got so long.

,Anxiety,"Hi Reddit. This is my 1st post and I just made an account because I've had enough....

Since I was about 8-9 years old, I can recall going thru periods where my chest feels tight, like I'm sitting at the bottom of a pool, all day. The ONLY thing that makes it go away is a deep, forced, sigh or yawn. Sometimes it lasts for a week, sometimes it lasts several months. There are no related triggers and it is not a panic attack. There is nothing wrong with my lungs (I've seen 2 pulmonologists). I've seen a speech pathologist; she gave me breathing that didn't help. I've been to therapy (including CBT), and while it helped me, it hasn't helped the BREATHING issue. After all these medical visits, NO ONE, not a single medical professional I've met with, knows what I'm talking about. The best I've gotten is sympathy, the worst was being dismissed and told that I'm making it up. 

I've met two people who described to me identical symptoms and I've read similar stories on the internet, which is how I know this is a symptom of anxiety. I've found blog posts from other frustrated people and there are even medical reviews on the condition if you search Google Scholar (its called 'sigh syndrome,' 'compulsive sighing,' or 'psychogenic dyspnea'). But most studies are kinda outdated, and at least two suggest ""reassuring the patient that they are fine"" as the ""treatment.""  I generally don't feel like I have anxiety, but its obvious that its connect in other so I am not ruling it out. 

It was the worst for me in college. I was very involved and very busy, so I believe it is related to stress. But again, its not acute.... It almost seems to work like a cold: if I am stressed for too long, I get 'run-down' and it sets in for a few weeks. I did track and field in college, ran 50+ miles per week, maintained a pretty normal sleep schedule and ate a pretty good diet. This is not going away with push-ups or vegetables (but if someone replies saying eating only kale forever fixes it......... I'd try it). 

After I graduated a few years ago, I took a pretty relaxed but unfulfilling job, and for those two years, the sighing stopped. I certainly went thru periods of relationship and COVID-induced stress, but the issue was gone. Except I recently returned to grad school and last week it started again. I'm not having it. I had a taste of freedom and I know I can't do this anymore. I forgot how AWFUL it is to sit thru meetings and go about life faking a normal, blank face while inside I feel like I'm literally drowning. I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for the 1st time, but the appointment is 2 months away and I'm worried it will go away by then, making it impossible to judge whether meds help. 

So my questions for you all: 

1. Anyone out there with a similar experience?
2. Has anyone met a medical professional that was familiar with this issue? 
3. Has anyone successfully solved the issue, with medication or otherwise? 

TL;DR 

I often suffer from a sensation that I am not breathing even though I am, which goes away if I yawn. I know the symptoms are related to anxiety. No doctor or therapist has ever known what I was talking about or been able to help, but I KNOW other people with this issue are out there feeling this way too.

,Anxiety,"Hello Everyone,

   I’m looking for another point of view on my situation. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. I’ll make it as short as I can. 
   
   I’m a 35 y/o male and I have Crohn’s Disease. I have it bad. I’ve had 3 bowel surgeries, I’ll have an ileostomy the rest of my life. I’ve had a fischer, I’ve had a large pocket of infection sliced open while I was awake, I’ve dealt with a year long battle with a stricture...this is where your bowels get blocked...I’ve had and healed 6 sub cutaneous fistulas (open holes on your belly that tunnel from your intestines and make an open hole on your belly) One surgery I was 6’1 and weighed 93 lbs (due to medical mismanagement) on and on and on. 
    
   I do not posses the vocabulary for the amount pain and sorrow I’ve been through. I’ve been on very high doses of Prednisone not for days or months...but years. Twice...I’ve been put on the strongest pain medicines know to man for years...and then gotten off of them. 
     
   The last two years I dealt with another stricture which yielded over 20 extremely traumatic messy ER visits. A full grown man screaming for mercy in pain. Nurses/Doctors running down hallways to push med in to get me out of pain. I ended up having a surgery a year ago to remove the stricture...it went well. 
    
   It was time to get off the pain meds three weeks later and day three, I crashed. The vomiting was so bad it split my incision. My PCP basically told me to go pound sand...he wouldn’t talk to me personally and trotted out some nurse to basically tell me day 3 was the worst and to suck it up. I went to the ER...they billed me as a drug seeker as well. They gave me no attention for 6 hours. I begged them for a CT scan. The radiologist saw the split. The doctor rushed into my room after 6 hours in agony...didn’t apologize and pushed a pain med finally. I forcefully demanded she contact my surgeon in a nearby big city. He found out what was going on and immediately had me taken by medcu to his hospital where they squared me away. He was pissed. 
   
   Fast forward a year later to present day. I have faithfully tapered off of Ketamine, Dilaudid and Fent patches...and I’m down to 12mg of Oxycodone per day. 
   
   In my state 4 years ago I was named Crohn’s and Colitis “Man of The Year” for my fundraising efforts and for counseling other folks in the same boat. In my whole city I’m the guy people come to for Crohn’s and Colitis help. That means the world to me. 
   
  I’m getting near the end of my taper like I said...and my anxiety is through the roof. I’ve been using medical pot for help and it’s been a big help. Unfortunately, I overdid it and used edibles and got Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Three absolutely terrifying ER trips two weeks ago. I have ceased all pot use for the time being naturally.
   
   I have a certified PTSD counselor I’ve met with once per week for the last two years, I juice, I have a thriving yoga practice, I drink 3 bottles of Essentia every day, I meditate through headspace every day, I use my Apple Watch for bio feedback, I quit coffee and alcohol, I take at least two baths per day and I walk at least three miles per day and I eat primarily nutrient dense food. I have arguably the greatest wife of all time and a beast of a Father who has been there for it all and never wavered. 
   
   I am processing all of this as I come off the drugs. I cry multiple times per day. Not even ashamed. It’s how I get all this shit out and heal. 
   
   The local ER and my new PCP will RX me everything under the sun but a rescue med.(A real one) I told my doctor about how some nights I’m pacing my house for literally hours. I’ve got Clonidine, Baclofen and Bispurone(Too afraid to take)
   
   I am getting my head kicked in every single day by major panic attacks. And I totally understand there is a major crackdown in my state on Benzos. Despite all of this...I am still crawling forward. I’m winning. Full on survival mode. It sounds arrogant and I am not an arrogant guy...but I am a fucking savage. I have been dealt some very unfortunate cards...this thing has almost killed me twice...it’s terrifying...it is absolutely terrifying. It might take me a minute sometimes...or a couple of days...but eventually...I stand up...I spit it in it’s fucking face and keep crawling forward. It’s not pretty...it’s not heroic it’s fucking war. And I’ve gotten to know a side of itself most people will not. And that’s pretty damn cool. Steal sharpens steal. I’m also, letting Christ back into my life...slowly(Really hard but worth it) I am so proud of myself.

But somebody please...help me understand...why a guy like me can’t get 5 Ativan for a month for a rescue med. Give me one single pill, so I can stare at it...and at least know I could end my suffering if I wanted. There’s power in that, at least for me. A few pills for when I lock up in a panic attack that lasts for more then an hour I do not think is an unreasonable request. 

But they make me feel like I’m dirty or something or like I’m a drug seeker. They are so good at it, it’s like it’s part of their fucking training. I know what’s coming and no matter what I say I get schooled. And they make me feel like a drug seeker for asking. “Don’t want you to get addicted.” 

“Bullshit.”

These are the same cats that were filling 100 Oxycodone/Ativan with one phone call from me just a few years ago. No questions asked. There ain’t nobody that understands and respects these meds more then me. 

I have my own nutritionist watching over what I eat...I just got the local college strength coach on my pay roll...and I meet with them once a month...and I am dead serious.

Despite all this...I am on the verge of getting myself out of this (with a lot of help)...it’s not even a hole anymore...I’ve drilled through bedrock...and I’m literally about to pull myself out of it and win. Again. 

I know people that get 10 to go on vacation for flights?

I know this all sounded arrogant, I humbly bow my head and take my hat off to everyone dealing with this. Totally not trying to out suffer anyone. A panic attack is a panic attack. We all suffer....I’m just wound up.

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for another point of view on my situation. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. I’ll make it as short as I can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a 35 y/o male and I have Crohn’s Disease. I have it bad. I’ve had 3 bowel surgeries, I’ll have an ileostomy the rest of my life. I’ve had a fischer, I’ve had a large pocket of infection sliced open while I was awake, I’ve dealt with a year long battle with a stricture...this is where your bowels get blocked...I’ve had and healed 6 sub cutaneous fistulas (open holes on your belly that tunnel from your intestines and make an open hole on your belly) One surgery I was 6’1 and weighed 93 lbs (due to medical mismanagement) on and on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not posses the vocabulary for the amount pain and sorrow I’ve been through. I’ve been on very high doses of Prednisone not for days or months...but years. Twice...I’ve been put on the strongest pain medicines know to man for years...and then gotten off of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two years I dealt with another stricture which yielded over 20 extremely traumatic messy ER visits. A full grown man screaming for mercy in pain. Nurses/Doctors running down hallways to push med in to get me out of pain. I ended up having a surgery a year ago to remove the stricture...it went well. &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been extremely cautious this past year+ during the pandemic because a large portion of my family is in the high risk category for various health issues. In the past couple of months my mom and I (and the majority of my extended family) have become fully vaccinated but I’m still really nervous about “getting back to normal”. Today, for the first time in over a year we went to a museum and then had a picnic in the park and it was finally feeling somewhat ok... until some lady walked past us and pulled her mask down to cough in my mother’s face. We got angry and she said that we had already been giving her dirty looks so this was just an attempt to start a fight and that she wouldn’t let us ruin her day while walking away giving us the finger. Everyone around us looked at us like we were in the wrong for starting an argument or being upset and I felt really gross about the whole ordeal. 
It happened hours ago but I can’t help but keep thinking about it, which makes me anxious all over again, and I feel like the whole thing has just pushed me right back into the hermit mindset that I’ve felt most comfortable in during the pandemic.

,Anxiety,"Hi all,

Chronically anxiety-ridden college student here. Today is the last day of the semester and I had to say goodbye to my crush who is graduating. We flirted on and off the whole semester but due to my anxiety I never worked up enough courage to take it to the next level, and now I will most definitely never see him again. I've been had multiple anxiety attacks and meltdowns today due to the immense regret and anxiety I feel about the whole situation. I can't help but feel that if I had just gotten over my anxiety we might have been able to pursue a relationship and now my chances are over. My meds (buspirone) doesn't seem to be working and my therapist is already off-contract for the summer (I use my school's counseling services)

&lt;p&gt;Chronically anxiety-ridden college student here. Today is the last day of the semester and I had to say goodbye to my crush who is graduating. We flirted on and off the whole semester but due to my anxiety I never worked up enough courage to take it to the next level, and now I will most definitely never see him again. I&amp;#39;ve been had multiple anxiety attacks and meltdowns today due to the immense regret and anxiety I feel about the whole situation. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that if I had just gotten over my anxiety we might have been able to pursue a relationship and now my chances are over. My meds (buspirone) doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be working and my therapist is already off-contract for the summer (I use my school&amp;#39;s counseling services)&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"The irony! 

Long story ahead: August 2020 I herniated a disc resulting in bad sciatica. Ended up having surgery in November, and then began having pain again at the end of December. February 2021 I got an MRI and found out I reherniated. A week after the MRI I had an episode of vertigo that lasted all day. Since then I've been having weird episodes of feeling off balance and foggy and an increase in anxiety. March 2nd I had a second surgery and there's definitely a good amount of anxiety surrounding the recovery. Pretty constant fear of reherniation, and because this was a nerve injury, it's a very non-linear recovery. Nerves are sensitive and can get fired up easily, and even cause pains and sensations as they heal. So lots of moments of being like, ""what is this new sensation?!""

I saw my PCP on Tuesday to talk about the weird dizzy spells I have, that sounds a lot like Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness. My PCP had never heard of this and she figured it's anxiety related to the surgery and recovery. She prescribed 30mg a day of Cymbalta to help with the anxiety and some of the nerve stuff. I took my first pill Tuesday evening, and took my Gabapentin later that night. Woke up at 11pm and was really dizzy and my whole body started tingling. The next day I felt super off. Was exhausted, couldn't focus, felt off balance and weak and had nausea off and on. Today started off fine, but as the day went on I just got more and more anxious. I haven't taken the Cymbalta or my Gabapentin since, and frankly I'm scared to try the Cymbalta again. Last thing I want/need is to feel totally out of it and off balance. It's important for me to get out and walk as much as possible and do my PT exercises to strengthen my back and keep the nerve moving, and now my anxiety is getting so bad I barely want to go past my block. So...seems like I definitely need the assist from the Cymbalta, but I'm also really afraid of the side effects.

I had a job interview last week that I crushed. I’m not a super confident person, but I feel confident about that interview. 

Today was interview two with the company. It was over zoom and there were two interviewers vs one person over the phone. 

I feel as if I was “good” in the interview. I did not feel confident. 

I think what gets me nervous is people looking at me. I HATE the spotlight. 

I have another zoom interview with a company I REALLY want the job for, round one, on Monday. Two people are interviewing me. 

Any tips on calming the f down? Thinking clearly and not letting my tornado of a mind take me up in a whirlwind? I am qualified for both these jobs and fit in very well with their values and am passionate about their causes. I just get so dang anxious!

,Anxiety,"For the past few weeks, I have been in an anxious spiral about determinism and the illusion of free will. I have had anxiety my whole life I believe. I'm in therapy and I just got prescribed a new med that I will start tomorrow.

I believe I am experiencing DP/DR (it is something I have dealt with on and off) around it but I'm not sure. I keep ruminating about free will. My every action that I take (including writing this) I keep thinking how I did not truly choose, how it was caused by some molecular process unbeknownst to me, how the whole of who I am is just a collection of stimuli. And what's odd is that I didn't think otherwise before this happened but all of a sudden, every action is terrifying because I don't experience it as mine. Just now I started eating pizza and it scared me as I didn't actively choose to do so. I know we do tons of things unconsciously but again, my anxiety makes me feel like I am a calculator. 

I've been obsessing googling on it and I have read on compatiblism (which is a semantic shift, it seems) and just accepting it is an illusion. But accepting that makes me feel like i'm strapped to a rocket hurling toward something and I am immensely afraid.

When I try to practice mindfulness and see the thoughts and feelings as thoughts, my brain fights back and says I'm just denying the truth. At one point, I didn't want to eat because I thought ""Did I choose to eat or did several seconds before I was aware, neuronal process started and I was always going to eat."" I feel like an automation and I am seeing everyone around me as such.

I know my anxiety is probably clouding my thinking and I have had moments of calm where I wasn't as bothered. But then I begin to question further, thinking how terrifying it is that my sense of self and thinking could be influenced so heavily. And the thought spiral continues. It makes it hard to do the things that I know can help because I think ""I have no control if it happens. I can only hope I will do the things to alleviate my suffering.""

,Anxiety,"She wrote me saying this 8 months after no contact through the mail and just the way she wrote it seems so hurt and pointing blame. Following this will be my side of it and it just makes me so sad because I have CLEAR EXAMPLES of how it was not the case that she wrote. I have been unpacking it once a week in therapy. 

Dear (x), I found out I was pregnant late January 2020 after we had used protection and I took a Plan-B pill. I told you that I was pregnant immediately when I found out. You instantly freaked out and told me that you did not want to have a child. I asked you why and you said that you had too much going on in your life and listed so many reasons as to why you did not want to have a child. You broke my heart and I felt so rejected by you voicing this objection. After this interaction with my you, I felt extremely alone and did not know what to do. I felt abandoned by you and I felt that I could not rely on you to take care of me and our child. I sunk into a deep depression and anxiety and thought about killing myself multiple times a day. I did not feel like I could take care of a child … I had just been hit by a truck and was still struggling with numerous physical and psychological problems due to the accident. I also had no job, no money, large school debt, and just so many other unstable factors in my life at the time. It was probably one of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make to terminate the pregnancy and that is something I will always be living with. I had an intentional miscarriage in and I hope to never be in that situation again in my life. I am left feeling hurt, angry, and sad by all of this. 

Now my part: Before reading this I must say this, it is long but for the purpose of context. I am a caring person and as you read I hope you will know that I tried to do everything with no malicious intent and just no intent for hurt. Yet she doesn't see this and that kills me because she only sees what she interpreted.

I am 26 and she is 28. 

My ex and I were together for 6 years. 

We almost never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things, those were usually civil conversations voicing issues or concerns then discussing how we can fix them together or individually.  We met in college, moved in together in secret from her parents for 3 years, then moved apart to our parents(only 15 minutes apart) as we finished college. 

Now for what happened:

My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.

She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and constantly made decisions to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Or she hid us living together for 3 years because her parents believe in marriage first. Her father - he doesnt hold his tongue. One time he threatened to divorce her mom had he not got his way with demanding his daughters boyfriend to leave the house. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 

My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.

So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021 on our anniversary because we would have had jobs and such, as well she told me I needed to ask her parents and they wanted me to have a career in place to support their daughter. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.

Traumatic Event:

We are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it had failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have had moments of horrible anxiety which she knew about. For example, my dad had a heart attack and my anxiety caused me to have a panic attack. My panic in this moment of the pregnancy is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and EXTREMELY intrusive thoughts. I normally have intrusive thoughts as my primary anxiety symptom. 

These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. But I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me since this has happened before marriage as you said before how much they value that."" ""I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all these circumstances."" ""I will be a first year teacher and that will mean I need to work a bunch outside of school to plan lessons and such and I dont want all of the responsibilities to be on you."" ""I just dont feel ready."" ""I grew up poor and I dont want you to ever deal with that."" ""I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all of these circumstances."" My panic turned into a trance where I thought and voiced ""I just dont know or feel ready to be a father."" 

She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I have always pushed myself. Its what motivates me. She agrees but still seems really sad, and she goes home then after this. Texting me how sad she felt because that was suppose to be a happy moment for a couple to experience but my panic attack and anxiety made her feel worried. (As I said nothing I was saying was false during my panic attack, it was all real issues we were facing right then. We didnt have jobs, we didnt live together, we were not engaged, and she was recovering from an accident she was involved in.) She told me she felt worried, and I just told her we need to figure everything out and it will be okay. I also would preface I was saying ""i dont know if I am ready to be a father because.... then listing reasons above (no job, not married, not living together, first year teacher would mean she would need to step up a bunch since I would be doing a lot of work outside of work to plan). 

I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast half of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby out of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 

Now, another week later, not as emotionally charged from the news of an unexpected pregnancy, I wrote her a letter explaining my panic, apologizing for the hurt she felt directly from my panic, and how I was not worried about me specifically but rather worried about how I was going to take care of her and our baby. ""My intrusive thoughts came out as I am not ready, but really I meant I dont know how I will figure everything out such as finding work, getting engaged and marrying you so your parents are not mad at you and I, and I just dont want you and I to struggle like my parents did."" As well with this letter I give my pros and cons to each option but preface with saying that whatever I say does not matter because I cannot make the decision and further, I will support whatever she decides. We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security and her being on recovery from the accident. She NEVER mentions before the abortion about my own panic and not being able to rely on me. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.

She tells me about pain, and so we go to the emergency room as she is worried about an eptopic pregnancy. I am in the room holding her hand and when they tell her its not, I feel relief and I am happy everything is fine. Yet she doesn't seem to see this. 

After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month until the abortion looking for work 8 hours a day. She didnt see this because she and I lived seperately. I would tell her I am looking, but I just assume now she felt hurt and didnt believe me and my effort since all she already took from everything was that I didnt want to have a child with her, which honestly swear to god was not the case at all. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat especially as a teacher and so I was looking elsewhere for whatever I could find.  Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.

Another week and at this point we are going together to ALL of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I WANT to keep our baby, but I also see the pros if we go with abortion we can get careers and set up our lives and not struggle financially then plan to have children, but if not, then I still want children in our future with her. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision. I tell her it kills me to be leaning towards abortion because I have wanted to have a family with her and be married to her for so long now. But finances have held me back and thus why now that we graduated I look forward to the next few years in that we can make money, get married, and have kids. It kills me to this day we went with an abortion. I tell her that I believe abortion is our best option given our circumstances but to be clear I still want a family with her in the future when we are more financially ready (both having jobs).

Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.

A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 

The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 

It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.

We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. Almost like having a PTSD episode after sex, I tend to calm her down each time and I understand her anxiety. I continue to tell her if she doesn't want to we dont have to until she feels comfortable. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs. 

Fast forward to the break up (NONE OF THIS WAS SAID BEFORE THE BREAKUP): she tells me that I was unsupportive, and that my actions were shit. She said if I cared I would have proposed to her, I would have found a job, and that my panic attack showed her that I didnt care about her. This hurt because all of this was wrong. I tried telling her but she just kept saying she cant trust nor rely on me any longer. She said that I was not the man she thought and that I broke her heart into a thousand pieces. She said that my actions showed her and this just killed me because I tried... I truly did. But she had these expectations that seemed like she wanted me to have a job, propose, and make sure we keep the baby all within a month before the abortion because ""if i did that I would have shown I cared"". Further she took my panic attack that was worrying about realistic things and even more so focused on how I would provide her with stability and happiness and said that when I panicked it showed her that none of this was right. She said ""when a baby is announced it is suppose to be an amazing moment for a couple, but you ruined it and made me feel rejected and made me panic. Had you not panicked I likely would never have considered the abortion."". As I detailed above I was as supportive as I could have been and she just lived by these expectations and when they were not met, she blamed me despite my efforts. ""Your efforts were shit. You could have done it if you really cared and you know that. But you just choose to blame it on your anxiety."" 

This ^ has been the most traumatic thing in my life. Abortion and then for her to blame me during the breakup 8 months afterwards. But not once talk about those feelings before.

6 months later after the abortion... 

Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy work schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 

Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). 

She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. 

Now to the most current thing:


We argue about her not giving me any time to see her (1 day a week and only for a couple hours) then she says that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.

2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.

A week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me/kick my brain mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. I didnt argue at all but listened and apologized.

She tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. ""Had you not reacted the way you did, I likely would not have chosen to get an abortion."" She said. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident.

Then she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. 

She removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. Then months after she blocked me. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially ""Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions"" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. 

Since our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me BECAUSE of my anxiety. I blame myself deeply for having a panic attack and having anxiety. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.

I have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. 

I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue.

I tried to communicate but it just feels like now she only listened to what she wanted to hear and only saw the actions she wanted to see, which unfortunately are the ones that hurt her. I told her I never intended any hurt, pain, rejection, or trust breaking. I realize intent or not she was hurt, and would ask how she could forgive me. Unfortunately she wouldn't forgive me and left me with chances, like ""I have given you more chances then I should and I just continue to get hurt."" To which I just felt like it was a losing battle since I never once repeated my mistakes once they were brought to my attention I tried diligently to never do them again. Panic attack - therapeutic options explored, taking the test and arguing about my family - cut off my family members, struggling with depression and not seeing her but 1 day a week and having times of negativity and crying during that day - when mentioned I got onto depression medication and started therapy and even asked her to go to therapy together. She kept score of her hurts and would not forgive me despite not repeating mistakes.

I honestly feel like since breaking up, she considers me her reason for her trauma. She blamed me a bunch during the breakup. It kills me because I am a very caring person and even just knowing this has made me contemplate suicide because it kills me to think that she feels that I did any of this to hurt her or cause her trauma.

What is your take on my story with my ex? 

TLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after her abortion and blaming me because she felt rejected, like she couldn't trust or rely on me, and blamed me for my anxiety attack. She blames me for being unsupportive and says I was not there for her when she needed me, yet I feel I was but just not up to her expectations.",t2_9tn4ot78,False,,0,False,She wrote me after 8 months of no contact to blame me for her pain,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,adviceneeded,0,,,False,t3_n6rn5m,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620395850.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wrote me saying this 8 months after no contact through the mail and just the way she wrote it seems so hurt and pointing blame.

For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and constantly made decisions to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Or she hid us living together for 3 years because her parents believe in marriage first. Her father - he doesnt hold his tongue. One time he threatened to divorce her mom had he not got his way with demanding his daughters boyfriend to leave the house. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021 on our anniversary because we would have had jobs and such, as well she told me I needed to ask her parents and they wanted me to have a career in place to support their daughter. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traumatic Event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it had failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have had moments of horrible anxiety which she knew about. For example, my dad had a heart attack and my anxiety caused me to have a panic attack. My panic in this moment of the pregnancy is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and EXTREMELY intrusive thoughts. I normally have intrusive thoughts as my primary anxiety symptom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: &amp;quot;I am so grateful and happy for this. But I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me since this has happened before marriage as you said before how much they value that.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all these circumstances.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I will be a first year teacher and that will mean I need to work a bunch outside of school to plan lessons and such and I dont want all of the responsibilities to be on you.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I just dont feel ready.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I grew up poor and I dont want you to ever deal with that.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I dont know if I am ready to be a father because of all of these circumstances.&amp;quot; My panic turned into a trance where I thought and voiced &amp;quot;I just dont know or feel ready to be a father.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I have always pushed myself. Its what motivates me. She agrees but still seems really sad, and she goes home then after this. Texting me how sad she felt because that was suppose to be a happy moment for a couple to experience but my panic attack and anxiety made her feel worried. (As I said nothing I was saying was false during my panic attack, it was all real issues we were facing right then. We didnt have jobs, we didnt live together, we were not engaged, and she was recovering from an accident she was involved in.) She told me she felt worried, and I just told her we need to figure everything out and it will be okay. I also would preface I was saying &amp;quot;i dont know if I am ready to be a father because.... then listing reasons above (no job, not married, not living together, first year teacher would mean she would need to step up a bunch since I would be doing a lot of work outside of work to plan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast half of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby out of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, another week later, not as emotionally charged from the news of an unexpected pregnancy, I wrote her a letter explaining my panic, apologizing for the hurt she felt directly from my panic, and how I was not worried about me specifically but rather worried about how I was going to take care of her and our baby. &amp;quot;My intrusive thoughts came out as I am not ready, but really I meant I dont know how I will figure everything out such as finding work, getting engaged and marrying you so your parents are not mad at you and I, and I just dont want you and I to struggle like my parents did.&amp;quot; As well with this letter I give my pros and cons to each option but preface with saying that whatever I say does not matter because I cannot make the decision and further, I will support whatever she decides. We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security and her being on recovery from the accident. She NEVER mentions before the abortion about my own panic and not being able to rely on me. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tells me about pain, and so we go to the emergency room as she is worried about an eptopic pregnancy. I am in the room holding her hand and when they tell her its not, I feel relief and I am happy everything is fine. Yet she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to see this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month until the abortion looking for work 8 hours a day. She didnt see this because she and I lived seperately. I would tell her I am looking, but I just assume now she felt hurt and didnt believe me and my effort since all she already took from everything was that I didnt want to have a child with her, which honestly swear to god was not the case at all. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat especially as a teacher and so I was looking elsewhere for whatever I could find.  Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week and at this point we are going together to ALL of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I WANT to keep our baby, but I also see the pros if we go with abortion we can get careers and set up our lives and not struggle financially then plan to have children, but if not, then I still want children in our future with her. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision. I tell her it kills me to be leaning towards abortion because I have wanted to have a family with her and be married to her for so long now. But finances have held me back and thus why now that we graduated I look forward to the next few years in that we can make money, get married, and have kids. It kills me to this day we went with an abortion. I tell her that I believe abortion is our best option given our circumstances but to be clear I still want a family with her in the future when we are more financially ready (both having jobs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn&amp;#39;t believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. Almost like having a PTSD episode after sex, I tend to calm her down each time and I understand her anxiety. I continue to tell her if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to we dont have to until she feels comfortable. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the break up (NONE OF THIS WAS SAID BEFORE THE BREAKUP): she tells me that I was unsupportive, and that my actions were shit. She said if I cared I would have proposed to her, I would have found a job, and that my panic attack showed her that I didnt care about her. This hurt because all of this was wrong. I tried telling her but she just kept saying she cant trust nor rely on me any longer. She said that I was not the man she thought and that I broke her heart into a thousand pieces. She said that my actions showed her and this just killed me because I tried... I truly did. But she had these expectations that seemed like she wanted me to have a job, propose, and make sure we keep the baby all within a month before the abortion because &amp;quot;if i did that I would have shown I cared&amp;quot;. Further she took my panic attack that was worrying about realistic things and even more so focused on how I would provide her with stability and happiness and said that when I panicked it showed her that none of this was right. She said &amp;quot;when a baby is announced it is suppose to be an amazing moment for a couple, but you ruined it and made me feel rejected and made me panic. Had you not panicked I likely would never have considered the abortion.&amp;quot;. As I detailed above I was as supportive as I could have been and she just lived by these expectations and when they were not met, she blamed me despite my efforts. &amp;quot;Your efforts were shit. You could have done it if you really cared and you know that. But you just choose to blame it on your anxiety.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ^ has been the most traumatic thing in my life. Abortion and then for her to blame me during the breakup 8 months afterwards. But not once talk about those feelings before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 months later after the abortion... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy work schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the most current thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue about her not giving me any time to see her (1 day a week and only for a couple hours) then she says that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me/kick my brain mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. I didnt argue at all but listened and apologized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. &amp;quot;Had you not reacted the way you did, I likely would not have chosen to get an abortion.&amp;quot; She said. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. Then months after she blocked me. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially &amp;quot;Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions&amp;quot; and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me BECAUSE of my anxiety. I blame myself deeply for having a panic attack and having anxiety. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to communicate but it just feels like now she only listened to what she wanted to hear and only saw the actions she wanted to see, which unfortunately are the ones that hurt her. I told her I never intended any hurt, pain, rejection, or trust breaking. I realize intent or not she was hurt, and would ask how she could forgive me. Unfortunately she wouldn&amp;#39;t forgive me and left me with chances, like &amp;quot;I have given you more chances then I should and I just continue to get hurt.&amp;quot; To which I just felt like it was a losing battle since I never once repeated my mistakes once they were brought to my attention I tried diligently to never do them again. Panic attack - therapeutic options explored, taking the test and arguing about my family - cut off my family members, struggling with depression and not seeing her but 1 day a week and having times of negativity and crying during that day - when mentioned I got onto depression medication and started therapy and even asked her to go to therapy together. She kept score of her hurts and would not forgive me despite not repeating mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel like since breaking up, she considers me her reason for her trauma. She blamed me a bunch during the breakup. It kills me because I am a very caring person and even just knowing this has made me contemplate suicide because it kills me to think that she feels that I did any of this to hurt her or cause her trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your take on my story with my ex? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after her abortion and blaming me because she felt rejected, like she couldn&amp;#39;t trust or rely on me, and blamed me for my anxiety attack. She blames me for being unsupportive and says I was not there for her when she needed me, yet I feel I was but just not up to her expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

It had me in the emergency room twice back to back, convinced me to be scared of taking any medication due to being anxious of somehow having an allergic reaction to them, being afraid to eat due to the fear of having a allergic reaction to ingredients in food, losing so much sleep because I notice my breathing slowing down or it feels like I forget to breathe so I get really anxious. 

This started when one night I was falling asleep and “noticed” my breathing was “off” and it triggered the worst panic attack of my life to where I ended up going to the hospital over it the next day AND the day after that. 

It’s making me focus on my breathing due to it feeling like I forgot to breathe and it just makes it harder to breathe easier!

,Anxiety,"Hello, 

I was just wondering if you guys had any recommendations for how to calm my anxiety when my girlfriend gets her covid vaccine. Unfortunately, I have a severe allergy to the vaccine and can not get it. That has translated into immense anxiety for my girlfriend who wants to get the vaccine ASAP. We are both in our 20s and I’m just fearing the worst. I’m worried about her having sudden severe side effects that really hurt her or having something come up in the future (I’m irrationally worried about cancer). Logically, I know she will be ok but I can’t stop thinking about something horrible happening. I want to be able to sleep for the next 4-5 weeks while she gets fully vaccinated. Is the Pfizer or moderna better for side effects? I know my anxiety is making her upset.

I can't focus on conversations if I'm not interested, I have to do 5 things at once, I can't stand quiet, I don't do things til last minute if they seem overwhelming, I'm incredibly disorganized, forgetful, and I procrastinate.

,Anxiety,"Long story short, I have been suffering with really bad gastritis (erosion of stomach lining) of unkown cause. I don't drink alcohol, don't drink/eat caffeine, rarely eat fatty foods and are one of the few people in the world who actually eat there five fruit a day. 

In my opinion, it was caused by severe anxiety/stress which has slowly been getting worse and worse over a period of years to the point where something as simple as me going to have my eyes tested tomorrow will make me very anxious/nausous. I am confident it's not caused psychologically and is in fact caused by something happening in my body. 

I know you aren't doctors but I was wondering what major medical reasons would cause anxiety that you guys know of i.e lack of a certain hormone, celiac disease etc etc. I'll be seeing a doctor next week on Monday regardless. I just want to hear your experiences :P

,Anxiety,"This is me reminiscing a bit, so ignore if you’re not into that. It happened a few months after I had gone on anxiety meds and finally started taking my mental health seriously. 

About two years ago when I was settling into my position after having been working a year, I was walking the production floor when my heart started to feel funny. Like it was too tired to really pump. To me it felt like my arms would after a hard workout the day before. 

I got through the rest of my walk and got back to the office and it still felt like that. My head felt a little spaced out, and breathing was tense. I mentioned to my coworker that I felt off, and after a series of events I got loaded into an ambulance and taken to the ER. A few hours later I was told I had a panic attack and was now good to go. 

It was my first panic attack not triggered by any mental situation, although it was a stressful time in my life. My main doctors believed that the residual chemicals of my anxiety just built up enough to actually trigger an attack. It definitely sucked but oh well. Stay the course and it shouldn’t happen again. 

I get back to work the next day and lay it all out for my manager and explained it was labeled an anxiety attack, and followed up the next week with my docs saying I was good to go. 

Well, a week later I get called into her office with HR present. We run through the whole situation again including what the docs said. 

And then she asks me what made me anxious. 

Now I’m a very literal person in the best of times, so I answered her question as literally as I could. 

“Because the chemicals in my brain were messed up.”

The story to all this is that your anxiety is not your fault. There won’t be a neat answer to everything. However, if you stay the course and listen to your med team, your symptoms can still be managed, ignorant (although maybe well meaning) people be damned.

&lt;p&gt;I got through the rest of my walk and got back to the office and it still felt like that. My head felt a little spaced out, and breathing was tense. I mentioned to my coworker that I felt off, and after a series of events I got loaded into an ambulance and taken to the ER. A few hours later I was told I had a panic attack and was now good to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first panic attack not triggered by any mental situation, although it was a stressful time in my life. My main doctors believed that the residual chemicals of my anxiety just built up enough to actually trigger an attack. It definitely sucked but oh well. Stay the course and it shouldn’t happen again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get back to work the next day and lay it all out for my manager and explained it was labeled an anxiety attack, and followed up the next week with my docs saying I was good to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a week later I get called into her office with HR present. We run through the whole situation again including what the docs said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she asks me what made me anxious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m a very literal person in the best of times, so I answered her question as literally as I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because the chemicals in my brain were messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story to all this is that your anxiety is not your fault. There won’t be a neat answer to everything. However, if you stay the course and listen to your med team, your symptoms can still be managed, ignorant (although maybe well meaning) people be damned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry for any weird phrasing, my keyboard is lagging horribly making me randomly lose my train of thought while I wait for it to catch up.)&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"After years of managing to keep my anxiety in check, the last few weeks made the wall that I build around it crumbled.

Ever since I was young  all I ever felt was anxiety, and the thing that made a good or bad day was how anxious I was. I started taking medication (sertraline) and it helped but at that point I was already starting to build a mental blockade around my anxiety. 

The thing is, Anxiety wasn't the only thing that stayed inside. Everything got locked in there. There as never been a thing that I really enjoyed doing. Everything is just kind of a pastime. I don't feel happy doing it, but I also don't feel sad. 

The only thing that could leak thought this dam that I build was anxiety, but I could manage it ok. It was annoying, but I could still function. 

Got through the first and second year of uni fine, even when covid came at the end of the second one. I made really good friends here, some of the best people I have ever met in my life, but I feel like was never really being honest with then, because, after all, all I was feeling was anxiety, I didnt know any other emotion. I knew I liked being around then, but I could never point any specific thing about then that made me like then. 

And then shit hit the fan

Someone close to me had a breakdown, very serious one.

I think i managed to help, my friend got medical help, and is doing much better now. But after the dust settled and the shock was over, my brain just completely melted.

I started having 2 to 3 panics attacks per day. I was able to manage then for about a week, but after that they were going full force on me and I couldn't do anything about it.

The dam had broken. And on top of that shit ton of anxiety I had stored over the years, every other emotion that I had never had to deal with rushed in all at once.


All of a sudden I wasn't just dealing with anxiety, I was also dealing with being sad, scared, and feeling worthless. I am now not only dealing with panic attacks, but also just crying myself to sleep and feeling like shit in general.

I think that I have never loved or hated anything. It was all just meh. And now I have no fucking clued of what to do.

I just want to build it back up. Fell nothing again, it's much better that way. Right now I'm taking Xanax and it's the only thing that is keeping me from going absolute insane.

,Anxiety,"I had a sinus infection two months ago. A week later, I had a panic attack while driving after rolling my window up. I didn’t realize it was an attack, I just thought I had too much caffeine. A week later, I had a severe sudden panic attack that sent me to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. They said “panic disorder.” I then started to suffer from DR for days after that attack and then it improved. I was constantly anxious and having panic attacks daily...I couldn’t drive, could barely leave the house. Had more intense panic attacks and went to the ER twice more. I also noticed my ears were painful, like stabbing my eardrum pain and my sinuses felt like balloons when I would lay down, but I didn’t have a runny nose so I assumed maybe allergies or just a weird symptom of panic...Cue more panic. They put me on anti-depressants and short term klonopin, recommended me to counseling. Which I started all but the anti-depressants.

The constant anxiety had me in constant fear of panic attacks so then I started having intrusive thoughts at night, especially after taking klonopin. Klonopin actually made me feel like I was just insane and would never be normal again. 

I saw my PCP yesterday who noticed my WBC has been high my last two blood draws. I asked her to check my ears...It turns out I have a pretty severe sinus infection and both of my ear drums are bulging from the pressure, with infection in one ear. We all know that ear pressure issues can cause dizziness and weird sensations in the body..Labyrinthitis (inner ear infection) can actually cause derealization which leads to panic attacks and anxiety.

I’m two doses of antibiotics in and I’m feeling from 10% to 60% better as far as the anxiety and panic. I haven’t needed klonopin and I haven’t really freaked out over my heartbeat, I’ve been able to see things around me and not feel so weird and off. I’m definitely not 100% here and do feel anxiety flare up a little when I start overthinking...but I’m not feeling so uncomfortable in my own body like I had for days. We also had a tornado hit the house I’m house sitting in Monday so that brought on some panic and anxiety all day Tuesday, but today I feel pretty good. Do you think it’s possible my anxiety and panic stemmed directly from the ear issue so now that I’m treating the infection, the secondary symptoms of the anxiety and panic should cease? OR is it possible I’ve just convinced myself it’s because of my ears and my improvement is the “placebo” affect?

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone

Tomorrow I go to get my 2nd and final vaccine shot (Pfizer). The first one went well, I had a sore arm and a swollen lymph node (that I didn't even know existed - doctor confirmed it was a normal side effect and would go down, which it did, I can still feel it if I prod and poke but I'm now accepting this is probably normal)

I'm quite young (29) but have been vaccinated early due to medications I take for Bipolar disorder. Alongside my bipolar I suffer with Generalised anxiety. Frustratingly my moods are stable through medication but anxiety is a constant battle, although I have managed to overcome panic attacks for the most part.

I keep worrying and fretting almost to the point of panic that I'll experience anaphylaxis or I'll have terrible side effects (I have anxiety over raised body temperatures and fevers) I was very lucky the first time around, so surely this time it's gonna hit me like a bus? 

I just feel... stupid. And I'm sorry if this post seems like i'm ungrateful, I'm absolutely not, and I do want to be vaccinated fully because the COVID anxiety itself was awful. But now I have anxiety over this?!

Just wanted to share my thoughts in a space where I'd feel safe to do so, and won't feel judged.

,Anxiety,"Recently I started to get bad anxiety again, nearly having a panic attack about a week ago. Recently I've been having more anxiety, but this time about my anxiety. And I did have a panic attack last night.

My thoughts go like this:

""My head feels so out of control, I cant relax, and I cant get a break, I'm exhausted.""

""What if this never stops? What if I cant sleep? What if it goes on for days and years? What if I'm like this the rest of my life?""

""What if I go insane and kill myself? Why am I thinking of suicide. Will I be pushed to that? Will I have to fight this every day for the rest of my life?""

The thought itself is repulsive and irrational. I dont think I will go insane, I know the thought is irrational and if it went away I wouldnt have to worry about it. But my mind is telling me it's a real threat which triggers the panic. 

A few years ago I had a really bad year for anxiety, almost constant the whole year until I read something that almost suddenly fixed it. I'm worried that will happen again, but this time there wont be such a fix.

Just wondering if anyone else shares this. That's what helped me before. I was getting intrusive thoughts and had no idea they were common and not very serious. When I read that they were it was like a storm cloud went away. 

I've had this particular anxiety for about a week now, I know it's not me and not normal. But I'm afraid of it becoming normal because my idiot brain is having a crisis. Then I start worrying about developing a disorder and spiraling out of control.

&lt;p&gt;The thought itself is repulsive and irrational. I dont think I will go insane, I know the thought is irrational and if it went away I wouldnt have to worry about it. But my mind is telling me it&amp;#39;s a real threat which triggers the panic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I had a really bad year for anxiety, almost constant the whole year until I read something that almost suddenly fixed it. I&amp;#39;m worried that will happen again, but this time there wont be such a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wondering if anyone else shares this. That&amp;#39;s what helped me before. I was getting intrusive thoughts and had no idea they were common and not very serious. When I read that they were it was like a storm cloud went away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had this particular anxiety for about a week now, I know it&amp;#39;s not me and not normal. But I&amp;#39;m afraid of it becoming normal because my idiot brain is having a crisis. Then I start worrying about developing a disorder and spiraling out of control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help though.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have had my driver's license for 2.5 years. Ever since I got it, I've taken residential roads everywhere. It takes me up to an hour of driving to get to an appointment 20 minutes away. When my dad would take me driving on the freeway, my heart would race and my vision would blur and I felt unbelievably anxious and unsafe. I completely gave up trying for a year and a half.

Finally, I decided I couldn't live like this anymore. Because of the safety risk (to myself and others) that I would cause by just exposure therapy-ing my way out of it, I started really slow. First I got comfortable with large, multilane residential roads. I got comfortable with changing lanes. I tried to improve my driving skills as much as possible and take risks/drive in new scary areas whenever I felt ready for it. I took friends with me so they could help advise me if I got too scared. I continued this process for a few months. Then, I started to transition to taking highways (faster than normal roads, but not controlled access). I got comfortable with the faster speeds over the course of a few more months.

Last week, I asked my dad to accompany me on the freeway for my first try since I gave up. As we sat in the turn lane for the entrance ramp, I felt my heart start to race. I questioned if we should just turn around and go home, maybe try again another day. But I knew that if I allowed myself to do that after all the work I had done, it would only make it up to be even scarier in my head. So, I did it. It was scary, but I did a really good job and after a few minutes I began to feel relaxed. People had always told me that it isn't scary because you are completely in control- but that's exactly what terrified me. This time, I understood. I felt in control, and that allowed me to relax. A couple of days later, my roommate offered to drive with me- nailed it again. Today, for the first time ever, I drove on the freeway alone. I was so nervous, but it wasn't that bad! The only mistake I made was getting off at the wrong exit, but I got right back on and saw it as an opportunity for more entrance ramp practice, which is the scariest part for me.

It seems like a weird thing to be so proud of since millions of people do it at least twice every single day, but it has been the source of so much anxiety and self-loathing for me. I just wanted to share this because over the past 2 years everyone has just told me to get over it, but that wasn't an option, and it isn't for many people with anxiety.

,Anxiety,"(This turned into kind of a long post. Tl;dr below.)

I've recently had my depression and anxiety come to a head, so to speak, and have been trying to take steps to address those issues. However, I can't seem to get past pretty crippling anxiety when it comes to my job. The annoying part is that it's a really good job. My company is super understanding, pays me incredibly well, has amazing benefits, and has a ton of flexibility. 

Unfortunately it's a sales job, and though I've somehow managed to work my way up in my career to achieving this position, I've never wanted to be a sales person. It does happen to be selling a great product, and not even in a high-pressure way (most of my job is account maintenance really), and also is in an industry I really love (though I feel pretty burnt out with it), which has made my job bearable and sometimes even enjoyable up 'til now, despite working in sales. 

I just can't get myself to do it. Every day it gets worse, and then I feel guilty for not doing enough when they've been as understanding as they have been, and that makes my anxiety even worse. It's gotten past the point of being acceptable though. I just physically can't get myself to do my job unless something happens that I absolutely have to address. It makes me feel physically sick to think about trying.

I feel like I'm being really stupid. Why can't I do this job that isn't even that hard? Am I being an absolute baby about this and just need to suck it up and try harder? I feel so worn down by trying to clench my teeth and just grit through life with a smile plastered on my face, but when I look at this objectively I feel like I'm just throwing away an opportunity that other people would be so grateful for and work so hard to do well in if given the chance.

I'm looking at stepping into other things that are lower pressure, but I've been in the same industry and in sales so long, it's extremely difficult to sidestep into anything that would pay me similarly. I interviewed with a place today that would be practically making half of what I am now, but I know I would be able to do it and not feel like I'm going to have a melt down every day. Finances would obviously be a lot tighter, but I think I can just barely make it work and be slightly financially stressed.

I have an appointment tomorrow morning with my PCP to talk about something specifically for my anxiety to add to what I'm taking for depression at the suggestion of my therapist and ranking as severe on the general anxiety disorder test she gave me. I guess I just need someone outside my life to be honest and tell me if I'm just being an annoying priveleged jerk for throwing away a super stable job that treats me super well. Thank you for reading if you got this far. If nothing else, it helps to vent about it a bit.

,Anxiety,"Hi folks!  I have had a recent bout with anxiety for about 2 months...and it has gotten worse over the past few weeks.  Last night, this culminated in a full blown Panic Attack!

I just wanted to share my thoughts as I hope they can be helpful for me to type out, and for others to read.

The attack came on slow, and may have been due to taking my first very small dose edible (which I now realize was NOT a good idea).  So starting at about 6pm the questions of ""am I walking straight?"" ""do I sound normal?"" started happening.  My wife said I seemed totally fine on the outside.

When it really started getting worse was around 8pm when we met up with her mom at a restaurant and we ate inside.  Ever been super anxious, inside a restaurant, feeling stoned from an edible for the first time ever?  It's not fun.  It came in waves, but the whole time I was unable to eat anything...just staring at the food on my plate knowing I wouldn't be able to eat it.

  
Eventually it got so bad I had to remove myself from the restaurant and head home separately.  Getting home was no issue.  That night, at 11pm...BOOM.  The panic attack hit and it was probably 45 minutes of pacing, drinking tea, and talking to my wife before I was able to calm down enough and my nervous system calmed down.

Today, the anxiety I am feeling is ""will that happen again?""  I just want you to know that Panic Attacks DO happen, but they will not kill you and they WILL end.

,Anxiety,"Hello!

I'm fairly new to this sub, even though I have been struggling with anxiety for the past three years. It all started Somewhere in 2018, a period where I have been drinking alcohol heavily. I have literally spent that entire year drinking, partying, etc. every single day/night. Had marriage issues and work was very stressful (funeral director). Then one day I got home, cooked some food, went to bed and woke up to rush to the bathroom to kiss my porcelain prince. From that day on, I have developed emetophobia and it has been haunting me ever since (even though I rarely, if ever, V\* - can literally count three times I did, and it was all alcohol induced), but it has also triggered severe anxiety (social mostly) and depression. I have lost quite a lot of weight, even though I have reduced alcohol consumption to a minimum, quit smoking and switched to vaping. Also got an amicable divorce because wife and I thought it was for the best (it was a very toxic relationship/marriage), and got left alone with a child and a fairly large financial debt, and everyone thinks that triggered my anxiety.

I currently consume an anxiolytic in the morning (Eglonyl 50mg - sulpiride), and a Xanax alternative (Misar 0,25mg) when shit hits the fan or before an ""important"" event, which is actually not that important or stressful.

Anyway, I have tried everything - read self-help books, meds (which only put me in a zombie-like state and make me feel sleepy which also triggers anxiety), therapy, etc.   
I really don't stress about finances, being alone with the kid and so on. What really bothers me is nausea because I keep falling into this fucking loop of:

Emetophobia -&gt; anxiety -&gt; nausea -&gt; repeat

It took me 3 years to finally come to the conclusion that emetophobia is the cause of my severe anxiety. It's on my mind 24/7. Slightest sound or sensation in my abdomen triggers an attack, even though my mind is rational and I KNOW it's nothing. But it triggers a chain reaction which in turn makes me super nauseous and drained.

If anyone can help me out, I will be eternally grateful because my quality of life has been reduced to dragging miserably through days. One day I'll be okay, but I'm panicking for the next three.

,Anxiety,"Is there an SSRI (or other medication) that calms anxiety and stops you from feeling uneasy and mentally fragile from things that happen in your life and from ruminating too much?

I understand that everyone's different etc but I'm wondering if there are ones that have been proven to do the job better than others, without giving side effects like erectile dysfunction, lack of sex drive, or taking away the natural vibrant part of your personality if that makes sense.

I've come out of an emotionally/psychologically abusive situation 6 months ago that's made me even more anxious about everything.

I keep getting headaches from cognitive dissonance and I'm affected by everything and feel so bad from having no certainty/closure in even little things that don't even matter.

My OCD is affecting me a lot and I'm getting obsessed with lots of things like what I've just stated plus other stuff, like people being passive-aggressive IRL which is massively triggering for me and affects me badly as that's how abusive friend was a lot of the time, not knowing what was happening or what he was thinking etc.

,Anxiety,"So, I recently had a full on panick attack (the day I decided to stop drinking caffeine) which led me to believe I was going to die soon in the most painful of ways. I have been suffering for almost 4 days and even refusing to take anxiety medication because of the side effect. Tuesday night was my breaking point for feeling like shit, and was determine to overcome this without medication. Yesterday was a struggle but was able to keep my anxiety attack to a tolerable level.

I have been suffering for almost 4 days and even refusing to take anxiety medication because of the side effect. Tuesday night was my breaking point for feeling like shit, and was determine to overcome this without medication. Yesterday was a struggle but was able to keep my anxiety attack to a tolerable level. Today is better, I still feel anxious but at a mild level. For some odd reason I decided to look up caffeine Withdrawal symptoms, and anxiety is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

I semi apologize in advance for how stupid this all might sound but i am genuinely fucking HURT. I am just lost as - as you know what. Well let's start with 2019- Literally the best year of my life, I had a nice group of friends, i was always going out, i lost a bunch of weight , i was happy, healthy and thriving. It seemed like everyday got better and it did, i ended up meeting my now fiance on a vacation in southern France ( a vacation i worked my ass off for a whole year working min wage to go to) 3 days after coming back in August I landed an amazing job with Chanel ( Literally do not know how i managed that ) &amp; I got accepted to university the same day as getting the new job- me and my dysfunctional ass family were finally good for once i literally had it the fuck all. (i was freshly 19 at the time). I don't know where it all went wrong, i literally do not. It came crumbling fast. The Chanel job was AMAZING, i was surrounded by new social people everyday, I made a bunch of new friends that were my age, everyday was a surprise, something to look forward to- It was the first job I was wholeheartedly was happy about and exited to go to. School started off pretty good too, i was just thriving - best i have ever been in life ( I put that on everything i love) My boss was really type B (type B on crack) she had a son my age and she started out very warm and motherly the first month but then became a micro managing, breathing down your neck, judgmental , always side eyeing YKW. She would always pick on the little things ( me not wearing enough makeup, one strand of hair being out of place, even saw a MAC lipstick in my pouch and shook her head at me) I honestly think in the beginning she was trying to help me, help me succeed with the brand , help me match the image of the company i was working for, etc. I did some stupid shit in the start of my working there, I was fresh back from a 2 month long vacation, newly in love, I was just high on life. The vacation me did not wear off, i was always smiley and chatty , texting my fiance constantly when i shouldn't, etc etc. When she had a conversation with me about that i did a complete 180 and snapped back into reality asap, i was no longer on my phone on the floor, i stayed in my section at all times, i was always on time, my sales were THROUGH THE ROOF, every single day, i was always booking appointments until max capacity, had a clientele within 2 months of working there , made 8 close close friend, the place felt like home, it was my home and safe space. Then January of 2020 things began to fall apart, i was working overtime at Chanel and couldn't keep up with school and ended up withdrawing from school, then my best friend and i ended up having a nasty nasty fight which almost got physical and we stopped being friends and did not talk ( Until now but it's not the same at all) , my boss became passive aggressive towards me, would almost ignore me and i felt uncomfortable af, my District boss was getting multiple multiple ""client complaints about me"" about things that NEVER EVER happened, i genuinely think my boss was filing them anonymously or having her friends do it because i swear on my life that i poured my heart out and gave it my all when it came to the actual work and clients, I ended up being fired the last day of January for another ""customer complaint"" a fake fucking customer complaint. My boss had worked there 14+ years and had a lot of power and sway, i don;t know what i ever did to her. I admit i was immature and high on love and life at first but when she checked me on it i straightened up the same second. After being fired everything went downhill, covid quarantine started, I lost contact with most of my friends, i ended up being kicked out from my house , didn't re-enroll in school( still haven't), gained all the weight back and more, got diagnosed with an physical illness, got put on strong ati anxiety/depression meds that did not work, and did not work for a year exactly due to being in a state that was heavily impacted by Covid. I started working again 2 months ago and things are getting better i guess or though i thought so but i still feel so empty, i feel so lonely and depressed, i see a couple friends here and there but it doens't make a difference on how i feel, it just isn't the same, my fiance and i haven't seen each other in almost 2 years ( will be 2 years in August) because of Covid, I don't think I will be able to see him this summer in person either France is closed off. I am grateful to have a job and make money ( i was in bed crying everyday for a whole hear) but my new job is so fucking miserable, all i do is stare at a computer and everybody is 40 years older than me, every day is the same.

,Anxiety,"i been in contact with my ex for about a month now but we been "" friends"" for 2 years but we messed around on again and off again during it. but ever since we started to talk again and well kinda start a sexual relationship to. ever since we had phone sex 2 times  its been starting to get in my head. i have all these anxious thoughts about what i am doing wrong, how can i be better. she knows i have anxiety and its caused us problems in our past before. but i am getting help ever since i was diagnosed with social anxiety and OCD about a year and a half ago.  

she told me that it meant something to her and that she does not do this with just anybody. so that made me feel a little better. but i always have had very strong feelings for this person ever since we dated. she was the first and so far only girl i have actually been in love with so far in my life. we are both 23 years old and she is a nurse so she is busy at nights but only works 3 days a week.  that is the background of well the whole situation. 

what i need help with is that i have all these anxieties building up in me and i wanted to talk to my therapist about it. but he canceled because he was sick. so that made me feel even worse.  like i actually had my first anxiety attack this week and it made me feel horrible. it's just everything with school, my friends and her my ex. i know i am a better person then i was in the past and she obviously sees that too. because she has been doing this with me for the last 2 weeks. i mean she even got jealous when she asked me about who i been with since we broken up. its been a long distance relationship. i know people say they don't work but i mean we still talk to each other a lot over the past 2 years.  so i mean that has to mean something right? 

i am just really nervous and extremely anxoius to talk to her about how i am feeling because she dose not like to talk about feelings. and i don't want to push her away either because of my anxiety. i just feel like there is something wrong with me, like i am doing something wrong and like when i think about what i want to ask her and tell her i begin to cry out of either anxiety or frustration with myself. because i fee like if i was just a little better things would be different. like i want to aks her about this relationship we have, the anxieties that i feel due to it, but i don't want to make it seem like its her fault or use this as an excuse because i hate using this as an excuse.

,Anxiety,"Weird title. So let me (19m, 124p, 5f 9.5in) explain. Whenever there’s something in my life that is related to a lot of risk or I’m just trying a bunch of new stuff in my life, I get anxious and it disturbs my life a lot. 

Fall of last year I met a girl and for two months my sleeping and eating was disturbed. When we got together and things seemed right my sleep cycle was easy to control and I didn’t feel awful everytime I had to eat.

She broke up shortly after and all the problems returned. Started a new job at that time and I felt awful for the first couple months. Couldn’t eat enough to feel strong and fresh. Just felt weak. Couldn’t eat lunch at work because I couldn’t fully relax. 

Things got better. But my job was a covid related job. So had to get a new job sooner or later. That kinda stressed me. And the eating problems came back a small bit. But nonetheless, I found a new job and had two weeks holiday in between which was really relaxing. 

Then, now, I started the new job. And there is so much stuff to learn (barista). I really enjoy it. It doesn’t stress me in the moment. Look forward to my next shift. And so on. But it’s just draining me so much. And as a beginner I have, of course, a lot of insecurities and such. And now I really feel my anxiety and eating problems coming back hard. 

My friends always kinda jokes that I can’t eat that much. But it’s never like I can’t eat. I’m super hungry. I just feel sick and loose appetite after a few bites. Or, like now, feel sick just thinking of food. 

But I have to eat. I’m already underweight. And not eating makes me so exhausted. I just can’t. And that makes me so sad and annoyed. Like, I feel helpless because I don’t know what to do.

,Anxiety,"My roommate is moving out after 5 years. When I'm in this apartment alone I think I won't be able to cope without her here. I need extra life in this place. I'm meeting strangers from craigslist but they're strangers...they're not my best friend. I just..when she's not here and I'm alone in the apartment I just feel like..like without her around I'll be trapped here, I won't leave. I won't get ready. I won't be motivated.

I've been posting all morning, crying some. I treat it like journaling...I don't know, it makes me not feel so alone. I haven't eaten or showered or dressed. I made my bed at least but fuck. I'm so scared. It's happening in one month and I don't know what I'm going to do to survive it. If I find a good person to move in, that'll help. Just having different energy around the house... but I just feel terrified.

She works in the morning and I don't work til noon so every morning I get a taste of what it'll be. Kind of. She still hugs me bye and sometimes brings me coffee or something but like...I wake up and cry and journal/post on reddit and try to feel out the feelings a bit. And I try to cope with the loneliness by reaching out to people, keeping my schedule pretty busy. I don't have a very robust social life so that's challenging but I joined Bumble BFF and met some people that now I guess I have people to go do things with..

I'm trying, but a moment ago I got up and walked in the other room and immediately felt like when she leaves things will get so rough for me mentally and I'll feel so suicidal.

This isn't the only source of stress in my life at the moment - our dog and my dad died 5 months ago and the grief is part of why she's leaving. My grief has triggered some serious abandonment issues and she couldn't deal. She needed space to grieve but when she took it I would panic internally and she couldn't be around it.

My feelings are so big. I guess I can't worry about what will happen in a month. I can only take it day by day. I loved living together but we grew too close, codependent, and I know I stopped some personal growth emotionally because I could count on her to help. Now I'm being dropped and I'm really struggling to manage my feelings on my own.

My anxiety is mostly focused on hypochondria. I would be good for a while and then I would have random flareups if I have a symptom or something along those lines. For example I was doing yardwork the other day and I think I may have gotten bitten by a bug. My fiancé looked at that little mark on the back of my neck and said that there is no bite marks it isn’t raised or inflamed it just looks like a little rash. I feel a normal person would put some Cortizone cream on it and see how it goes since I didn’t even know there was a mark there since it was in itching or anything. Instead I jumped to the conclusion that I got bit by something bad and that I’m going to get sick and I should go to urgent care. 

Seems like random events in my life flare things up and I will on things like for another example I went out for a few beers and a burger for my engagement and felt nauseous and upset to my stomach later on that night I automatically thought I had stomach cancer or something along those lines.

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have realized that many things that I attributed to just being a part of my personality had a lot to do with anxiety. I’ve struggled with it for most of my life (I’m 23F now and the earliest I can remember dealing with anxiety is when I was in elementary school) and I thought I knew the difference between things my anxiety caused and things I just didn’t want to do because of my personality. Now looking back I realize just how much I’ve been held back by this. I want to start changing myself, but now a new worry has entered my head: who am I outside of my anxiety? 
I’m not expecting anyone to answer that for me, I just wanted to add some context to my question.

,Anxiety,"I (39f) have 2 kids (7&amp;5) from previous relationship and my bf (38m) has 1 daughter who's 3. We've been together 2.5 years so I've known her since she was a baby and am very close with her.  We have a great bond. She absolutely adores me and it's become a bit of an inside joke when I'm around that dads invisible as she always wants me to do everything like get her dressed, put her to bed,  read stories etc if we're in a restaurant it always has to be me that takes her to the toilet.  it's very cute (and tiring haha).
I spend 2-3 nights a week at his place every week when I don't have my kids .

Tonight his daughter was showing me the presents they got for her mum. Lots if stuff, a foot spa , candles , a book , chocolates and a card. I instantly felt my anxiety rising. But its stupid because I appreciate that he's like that . If he didn't get her gifts on mother's day I'd find it weird.

But it got me thinking about my relationship with his daughter, I know he must appreciate the bond we have and he has said in the past that im good with her . But I had this thought pop into my head that he might do something for me on mother's day as we will be waking up together on that day with no kids (my kids get dropped off later in the day). I'm not expecting expensive gifts or anything, I just had this passing thought that he might acknowledge the effort I go to with his daughter.

But the problem I have is once the thought enters my brain it stays there like it's cemented in. And now I can't stop thinking about it. Its like an unwanted intrusive thought. This post isn't so much about wanting validation about being worthy of a step parent gift or gesture but more about wanting to stop being idealistic about situations?
I'm 90% sure he won't have organised anything at the most he will roll over in bed on the morning and say happy mother's day. And I'm afraid because of the way my brain latches onto these things I'm going to go straight into fight or flight mode. I'm fairly certain I'm going to be triggered . I'll either cry in bed right next to him or I'll act weird and distant until he leaves and burst into tears later until my kids arrive. Then my stupid anxious brain will probably start sending him messages and it will end up out of control.

,Anxiety,"15M. Country: Georgia.

Everything started about 1.5 months ago when my puppy bit me. I didn't get rabies from her because she is still alive an well. But after what I have read about rabies, completely destroyed my life.

Everytime I touch something, my mind keeps telling me that I will somehow get rabies. If I touch something, I immediately wash my hands. I even avoid touching my family members. My hands are irritated and dry from washing them frequently. 

About 25 days ago I noticed 3 dots on tip of my finger with very very short distance between them(1mm), thinking that bat bit me without me noticing. I still have these dots. I know it is so rare but I can't get rid of that kind of thoughts. I also have never seen a bat in my entire life.

I also have fear of getting rabies from stray cats in my backyard without them biting me. 3 days ago I left a water bottle outside and after drinking from it the first thing that came to my mind was that what if a rabid cat licked it and then it got into my cuts on my lips(I always have chapped lips).

Yesterday my neighbor's dog attacked my puppy. The dog is usually put on a leash and lives outsiders but my neighbor released him yesterday. The dog came into my backyard aggressively and chased my puppy. The dog couldn't manage to bite her but I am worried if the dog's saliva got on my puppy's fur and then I petted her with my irritated hands? 

My life has never been like this before. When I tell my family members about this, they say I am going to be okay and sometimes laugh at me. Getting rabies is worst fear of mine.

,Anxiety,"I’d been walking on a ship for the past two weeks, a skipper that navigated rough, depthless oceans where unseasoned passengers spent days bending over the side railings letting themselves bring up what needed to come up. I was one of those passengers in the sea of my dizziness and on a good number of days a phantasmagoric mist would radiate off the water’s surface, shrouding my vision beyond the ships edge. All I could look out into was a gray void in which faces of loved ones and friends would sometimes materialize for a brief moment before disintegrating into the expanse. I would sometimes be sick in my despondency and isolation, sick with fear which sent me rolling in my sheets in a half wakeful delirium where the moment stretched eternally in both directions, consuming my whole past and future in that instant. Usually upon waking the hard grip of all these things would have slipped and gave way to a fading red claw mark, that healed quickly under the morning sun and welcome events of the day.

I was one of those passengers in the sea of my dizziness and on a good number of days a phantasmagoric mist would radiate off the water’s surface, shrouding my vision beyond the ships edge. All I could look out into was a gray void in which faces of loved ones and friends would sometimes materialize for a brief moment before disintegrating into the expanse. I would sometimes be sick in my despondency and isolation, sick with fear which sent me rolling in my sheets in a half wakeful delirium where the moment stretched eternally in both directions, consuming my whole past and future in that instant. Usually upon waking the hard grip of all these things would have slipped and gave way to a fading red claw mark, that healed quickly under the morning sun and welcome events of the day.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone. Ive been going through a really rough 3 months with some severe depression and anxiety, especially depression. I have had MDD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years. Both of which are really bad. I took off the fall semester from school hoping I would get better and just worked, and then planned to return to school for the winter term. I tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that I unrolled from all of my classes, quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents. 

We thought things would have gotten better by now, but they’re only seeming to get worse. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high where I can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy. I feel like I can cry for hours which never used to happen. My anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with Xanax until my antidepressants start helping. 

So far in my life I’ve been on 8 different antidepressants and none have worked very well. I have just come off of Lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell. Now I’ve started taking both Wellbutrin and Sertraline, which I’m trying for a second time. 

I’m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy, I was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two, so I’m now talking to her twice a week. 

I’m having a really hard time if I should work this summer, so from when lockdown ends until end of August when I’ll move back to school. Or if I should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better. I have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me. So the money aspect isn’t a huge issue. The only part I’m struggling with is at the current summer job I have, I’m guaranteed full-time hours this year and get 3 days doing the job that pays the most in tips, and I’m concerned that if I take a year off I won’t get that next year. I’m just having a really difficult time deciding.

,Anxiety,"Hey, everyone!

I’m currently going trough therapy and I’m struggling hard with mental health now. I suffer from intrusive thoughts, obsessive, they don’t leave my mind. They could be about a thing from my everyday life like a mistake that will replay 24/7 or dark, disturbing thoughts. And i worry constantly. Since i started going to therapy I feel much better, many things and traumas from my life came to the surface.


However, since yesterday I have been feeling this horrible, tie knot in my stomach. It makes me sick, it causes me pain and even sorry for saying but it caused me diarrhea, it’s that hardcore. But I won’t be seeing my therapist until next week, and I don’t want to call her, because I already did a few days ago to see her earlier than scheduled, and I don’t want to become dependent on her for every little thing. 

Anyways, the main trigger was a date that I arranged with a guy that I’m seeing. Since we arranged the date, this sick feeling appeared. But I have also so many thing happening in my life like the mental health, stressful job. I don’t know what’s the trigger exactly?! 

How do you deal with this? Please, tell me!

When I am busy and into my things it stops.. But when i’m watching a movie, or laying down, it’s driving me crazy! And most importantly because I can’t find the reason.... 

Anyone, please if you know how to find the reason  through a technique or how to relax for a bit, I will be very thankful for the advice.

I know this is ridiculous but no matter how much I tell myself this I still have really bad FOMO and my mind wanders to thinking that I am going to be ditched as a friend.

To make things worse I can't stop overthinking the situation and coming up with scenarios that this was all done on purpose, I am annoying them, they actually don't like me etc.

I just feel like I have the responsibility to make sure others have all the information and if I haven’t provided them adequate information and they end up doing the wrong thing, it’ll be because I’ve failed to give them the right information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I stop doing this? I’m not intentionally meaning to be rude or anything but it could come across rude as I’m making the assumption that I need to spell it out to others. I have tried to pull back on this and be more aware of my tendency to over explain but then I feel like I’m being blasé and giving shit information. Is there ever a happy medium with anxiety? Why is it always two sides of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been on 15mg mirtazapine for a couple of months, doctor suggested going up to 30mg, did that for two weeks, worst two weeks of my life, now I've been back on the 15mg for the past three weeks, feeling better than I was on the 30mg but still incredibly anxious and having some bad panic attacks.

Lots of people suggested CBD, and I used to smoke a heap of weed during my early twenties and never really suffered from anxiety until I stopped, so it's intriguing me that it could be a potential help to ease the anxiousness.

My obligations are failling, my friendships seem like a lie and today is exactly 4 years since my grandmother died. My true guardian, role model and third parent. I try to cry but only dry tears come out. I feel like a dusty old book on the shelf of a closed library. Old, used and nonexistent in other people's lives. I don't know what to do.

I was supposed to hang out with them, but they told me they couldn't make it cause they had other plans, and their plan was to hang out together with another person without me.

,Anxiety,"My(33M) wonderful girlfriend(32F) gets anxious and stressed often and I would like advice or resources to help her or to help me help her overcome it, please.

Her biggest stressors are people in semi-official or authoritative positions- DMV, doctors, mechanics, veterinary receptionists even. She gets trapped focusing on the myriad of ways an interaction could go wrong, “what if they don’t like me”, “what if they yell at me”, “what if I say something stupid”. If she has time to think about the interaction beforehand she sinks.

But she is also a badass. Wildland Firefighter, Park Ranger, ass-kicker lay-down-the-law when some does something stupid in her park. If she doesn’t have a chance to wallow in hypotheticals, she’s incredible. She’s unstoppable in a crisis that needs a trained, instinctive response, or when helping someone else.

A current example that prompts me to write this: Our dog needs to go to the vet to get a routine heart-worm/flea/tick pill prescription. No procedure, no surgery, no commitment to this vet at all. We just need to get a prescription. She’s stressed and scared and all worked up over picking the right vet, calling to make the appointment, bringing the dog in. “What if I do it wrong?”. 
This is where my dilemma comes in: I want to be supportive and help her, but I also don’t want to enable this spiral into a paralyzing anxiety by simply doing everything for her: I can’t just be her crutch while she hides under a blanket(sometimes literally). Where is the middle ground? I feel a bit frustrated by her wallowing in the stress of what seems to me a preposterously simple task and my impulse is to give her a bit of tough love here. On the other hand, this anxiety is real to her, so I have to be understanding of that.

I'm so fucking tired. 
I've been trying to get help through the health care system in the country I live (not US), and today I went to an appointment that they booked for me, to get help with anxiety.
It wasn't a psychologist though, which I would've wanted to talk to, more like a counsellor type person. 
Anyway, I thought I give it a try anyway, if it's not the right fit maybe they can refer me to a psychologist?

Well, no. While I've been thinking about how nice it would be to just be gone forever, the person gave me some advice on an mindfulness app. 

I feel like this appointment now makes me feel even more like shit. If the healthcare provider doesn't take it seriously, who will? 

And no, I didn't talk to the person about these thoughts, because it felt stupid and ridiculous to sit there and tell her about how bad I feel when she doesn't seem to understand what the problem is at all. She basically interrupted me when I answered her questions too.

i'm not a professional, but i've always been determined to experiment with different ways to cope with my anxiety and deal with my negative thoughts. so i just wanted to share a tip that works for me, in hopes that someone out there will find it useful too!

🌻 THE TIP: Keeping a Notebook of Positive Affirmations
[ things needed: notebook + pen ]

-&gt; whenever you think of a negative thought, pause; take deep breaths. try to think of an affirmation that you wished someone would assure you with, or one that would help calm you down.

-&gt; then, write down that affirmation in your notebook. you can type it out in your phone, but i highly recommend having a physical book! i'm a student, and i often get sudden negative thoughts throughout my day. we're not allowed to use our phones during lessons so this is where my notebook serves as a ""first-aid kit"". it's easy to reach out for my notebook any time i'd like - so whenever i think of an affirmation to counter my negative thoughts, i can conveniently write it down.

-&gt; if it's too difficult to come up with an affirmation on your own, feel free to surf the net for positive daily reminders/uplifting quotes! you need not write it down word-for-word, you may always rephrase them to suit your situation :-)

-&gt; however, i personally found that coming up with my own affirmations was much more effective for me, as some quotes feel very cliche .. &gt;&lt;"" which is why i found that my own affirmations were more relatable to my own life ^^~

i understand that it may get really difficult to think of the positive side of things to counter your negative thoughts, especially when things get really tough. hence, this tip may not be helpful for some. however, i hope that everyone will hang in there. not all things will be easy, but not all things will be difficult - you're going to be okay! i'm rooting for you :-)",t2_by98j6h4,False,,0,False,how i deal with my negative thoughts,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,helpfultips,0,,,False,t3_n62w0l,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Helpful Tips!,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620320133.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hii! this is my first post on reddit so i hope i&amp;#39;m doing this right .. i recently got on this app because i started experiencing symptoms of anxiety, and a lot of negative thoughts more frequently than usual. and i&amp;#39;m glad i found this community as it makes me feel less alone :-)&lt;/p&gt;

I was stressed and stretched thin, more than I realized. I didn’t mean to be so negative and self-absorbed. 

Even though you didn’t think I was listening, I’ll tell you my thoughts on everything you were saying. I know I am not the only person with a lot on their plate. I’m sorry if it seems like I already had my fill, I just haven’t eaten in days. And I’m hungry and scared and I’m grasping at empty air most times so when I see you I am desperate for any scrap of normalcy I can get. “Please please please hear me out and let me relate and let me try to process anyone’s problems but my own. Mine are too big and I am too small. And I can only process so much. But I’m drowning your thoughts in my own while mine are already drowned by me swallowing yours.”

But I don’t really say that. I’m smiling, asking about your new job (and praying you don’t think it’s weird I said new when I know you started 6 months ago and now I’m sweating you might believe I’ve been neglecting you for just now asking). “Oh, glad you like it! These potatoes are great! Can you pass the gravy?”

Deep breath. Forget about that, it was nothing. 

That’s when my anxiety makes my stomach hurt with self-imposed guilt and distorted memories that are the wrong color. Memories that I share with others, only mine come with annotated, highlighted split-moments of me fiercely blushing, moments that others have long forgot. That’s when my anxiety likes to remind me that maybe, and I emphasize maybe, they remember.

My selfish anxiety is the sound of my ringtone. The notification of another missed call and an unheard voicemail. Every time it rings and bings and dings it somehow gets louder and harder to ignore. It’s the same sound of my heartbeat. Can everyone hear that too?

Missed spam calls bringing me missed voicemails so now I’m missing them all. And it’s all because I’m anxious about what I missed. Talk about the ultimate FOMO. 
 
It’s funny though. I don’t think I’m selfish. I overthink and I oversleep or don’t ever sleep but it’s not because it’s in my best interest. I’ll find myself in any horoscope you say is mine. I’ll even give you a good reason why. My anxiety disrupts my daydreams.

I was wondering if anyone else suffers from shortness of breath when it comes to anxiety. Usually, it happens at night for me but it's now happening all day and causing my chest to feel heavy.

I've tried distracting myself and it works sometimes but not all of the time. I am also taking Cymbalta 60mg to help but lately, it hasn't been helping...

,Anxiety,"Man, I get random bouts of extreme anxiety all the time for no reason. Like, I'm just trying to have a good time - I'm watching old anime, browsing online for information about the movies I might have missed watching as a kid, thinking about working on a piece of art.. and *bam*! Out of nowhere, just the worst feeling - my stomach is in knots, my heart is racing, I feel nauseous and jittery.

So I stop doing everything, and just sit there focusing on my breathing. Eventually, the anxiety calms down and we're back at lowtide. Just the usual, quiet buzzing of nerves in the back of my head. So, I think - ""Okay, we should be good. I should be able to look at art, or start on that sketch I've been putting off,"" when **boom**! *Again*! So I think, ""Alright, maybe no artwork. Maybe art is stressing me out."" So I put that idea aside for a moment, and just start browsing online and then it happens again! I have opened a single tab and there is nothing in the tab, but for some reason I am now severely anxious again.

Alright, alright. Maybe I should relax, right? Maybe it's browsing the internet late at night that's stressing me out. Maybe it's seeing the computer screen, or something. Never mind that generally speaking, I enjoy being awake alone at night, working on one kind of project or another. I guess today, my body just can't stand the internet. So, I look out into my room (a clean room, since I finished cleaning only an hour or so ago)... and it hits me again. 

It's like today, my body just doesn't want me to be happy. I'm not in a bad mood, I haven't looked at *anything* stressful, I've been *trying* to relax, but my body will just **not work with me.** My whole life, people have told me ""it's all in the way you think, Iyo!"" ""It's just a matter of regulating your emotions and your habits, Iyo!"" ""Just drink more water, Iyo!"" All of which is perfectly valid, but is apparently completely useless when it comes to this specific kind of situation. 

Comfy? **Check**. Hydrated? **Double check**. Did I eat well today? I tried to eat healthy, so.. *I think so?* Did I sleep? I actually *overslept*! I even tried to move around a little, set up for my workout routine for when the sun rises, lit some candles, put on a cute outfit.. nothing. It's just not working. I'm perfectly content with what I'm doing right now, but my body - my heart, my stomach, my hands - they're pounding, twisting, shaking.

 This happens so often, I can barely do anything I enjoy. I struggle with going on walks, talking with friends, painting, reading, writing, watching anime, gaming - literally everything I enjoy doing seems to freak me out. It's driving me up a wall, and then back down again!

I actually have an agency right now (although i didn't do much work yet) and when i see news like that my head is always like ""that could happen to you!"" which doesn't make sense to me. I knew about all these stuff beforehand so i did my research to look for serious agencies and the one i'm in was part of a bunch of ""best of"" lists. Famous models started from that agency. If they wanted to kidnap me they had plenty of chances already. But my mind won't stop. At night it gets much worse! Worse to the point where i feel like giving up on my dream and locking myself up at home and never leaving.

I fear that someday they'll offer me a job where i'll have to go to another country and i won't be able to accept it because my anxiety will get the best of me. 

And that's not all. I'm usually pretty paranoid about other everyday life stuff as well. Like going out at night, laptop cameras spying on you, being recorded without consent and stuff like that.

,Anxiety,"Life has been a mess for me lately and the amount of panic and anxiety I'm feeling right now could light up at least three cities, one of them being New York. 

Let's start with what caused all of the emotions I'm feeling right now: me starting at university, a pandemic and a break up. 

I started university last year in mid February. I was a big-eyed kid fresh out of high school and couldn't wait to finally start studying Law. You see, I decided I was going to Law school when I was 10 and have been hyperfixated on it since then. Whatever I did for school I did with Law school being my end goal in mind. Everyone in my life knew of my dream and said it was a match made in heaven. 

Since the academic year started in September, I missed out on a lot of coursework. It didn't matter to me. This was what I always dreamt of even if it meant studying all day all night. 

That dream got shattered real quick when the pandemic hit my country 4 weeks later. Suddenly I was pulled out of my dorm and had to follow online classes. It was crazy and I lost the support system I managed to create in those few weeks. Miss Anxiety was doing some overtime back then but with the help of my boyfriend I managed to pass two of my five June examens. This was obviously not enough but I got a second chance in January exams to prove myself.

Well, boyfriend of two years broke up with me right before those January exams. I was devastated. I cried for weeks and could barely move. Sadness and angst hit hard and I genuinely lost whatever little motivation I still had. I know I shouldn't have let it affect me as hard as it did but he was my everything back then and I just saw another part in my life go to sh\*t. It took me six months to get over it. January had long passed and my grades were once again not so stellar. 

Now I have one more exam season to prove myself. If I don't pass for all my exams I will not be allowed to sign up for another year. I feel like I'm prepared for the exams. I watched every online class and have read the books. I still feel like I won't succeed. That I'll fail like the first two times. Like anything I do won't be enough. That I'm not enough. I also feel like I'm running out of time. I know this is Miss Anxiety talking but I just can't stop panicking. I have three more months to prepare for my second chance at the January exams that could still save my butt. Still got the feeling I don't have enough time.

I just don't know what to do because even thinking of exams gives me a nasty feeling in my chest. Stopping had crossed my mind. I could still study a form of Law and go to Law school later if they'll allow me in but then I'll feel like I failed.

&lt;p&gt;Now I have one more exam season to prove myself. If I don&amp;#39;t pass for all my exams I will not be allowed to sign up for another year. I feel like I&amp;#39;m prepared for the exams. I watched every online class and have read the books. I still feel like I won&amp;#39;t succeed. That I&amp;#39;ll fail like the first two times. Like anything I do won&amp;#39;t be enough. That I&amp;#39;m not enough. I also feel like I&amp;#39;m running out of time. I know this is Miss Anxiety talking but I just can&amp;#39;t stop panicking. I have three more months to prepare for my second chance at the January exams that could still save my butt. Still got the feeling I don&amp;#39;t have enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do because even thinking of exams gives me a nasty feeling in my chest. Stopping had crossed my mind. I could still study a form of Law and go to Law school later if they&amp;#39;ll allow me in but then I&amp;#39;ll feel like I failed. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a few people asking about withdrawal symptoms coming off antidepressants. Indeed it's frequent to get withdrawal effects while cutting down on the dosage, and in fact discontinuation syndrome can be very potent. However, one risk that people are not aware of and that can make your life a living hell if your taper is not managed appropriately, is the medical case of **'protracted withdrawal':** if you taper off too quickly from long term treatment, **you can cause chronic damage to your central nervous system, which may not be resolved by going back on the med.** This is something doctors never mentioned, and has only recently been recognised in medical circles. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's what happened to me over the winter. I had been taking Amitriptyline (AMT) for about a year after being diagnosed with chronic insomnia in 2019. Also took Lyrica for a while and came off that easily (almost cold turkey) last year. I had an unsuccessful attempt at tapering off AMT last year but everything came back to normal when I reinstated the original dose. However , when I tried to come off again last winter, it was an absolute disaster: overnight, I developed horrendous anxiety (on the 8th of February), and when I reinstated the original dose of AMT a few weeks after, it did not subside. I'm now at a higher dose of AMT than I was originally and still suffering all day every day (3 months after the onset).  It is debilitating, exhausting, and there is no saying how long it will last. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although this happens in a minority of cases, and most people are able to taper off over a matter of months, my message to anyone on psyche meds wishing to come off is please, really do take your time. **never more than 10% of the dose per month,** and towards the end of the taper, slow down to 5% of the dose per month. The risk of a protracted withdrawal really isn't worth taking. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For people on here who may already be suffering please feel free to find support on the forum below (also includes Benzos withdrawal advice): there are some doctors and many experienced withdrawal veterans who know how to help.**

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.survivingantidepressants.org](https://www.survivingantidepressants.org)

&amp;#x200B;

Some more advice I wish I'd known:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The reason why it's important to leave 4-6 weeks between dropping dosage is that withdrawal symptoms don't usually appear over night. It usually takes days and sometimes up to a month or so after. if you have decreased the dose again in the meantime you're just fucking yourself over even more.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As soon as you start experiencing withdrawal symptoms, or symptoms that you had never noticed before, stop the taper, and go back up one dose. If you wait and see, it may go away, but if it gets worse, the longer it goes on for, the lower the chances reinstating the med will actually work again.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A successful taper isn't 'I got off this med in X weeks' - it's a taper where you don't suffer. take your time, look after your mind. Listen to your body: if the quality of your sleep deteriorates, your sex drive goes, you lose your appetite, something is not right. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Don't move too quickly when you have stabilised. Just because you don't have withdrawal symptoms anymore after reinstating the dose doesn't mean your mind is fully repaired. Give it a few months without any symptoms before you continue with tapering. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely think Moderators should stick a permanent post on this (will leave up to them to write but happy to help a bit if needed).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a few people asking about withdrawal symptoms coming off antidepressants. Indeed it&amp;#39;s frequent to get withdrawal effects while cutting down on the dosage, and in fact discontinuation syndrome can be very potent. However, one risk that people are not aware of and that can make your life a living hell if your taper is not managed appropriately, is the medical case of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;protracted withdrawal&amp;#39;:&lt;/strong&gt; if you taper off too quickly from long term treatment, &lt;strong&gt;you can cause chronic damage to your central nervous system, which may not be resolved by going back on the med.&lt;/strong&gt; This is something doctors never mentioned, and has only recently been recognised in medical circles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s what happened to me over the winter. I had been taking Amitriptyline (AMT) for about a year after being diagnosed with chronic insomnia in 2019. Also took Lyrica for a while and came off that easily (almost cold turkey) last year. I had an unsuccessful attempt at tapering off AMT last year but everything came back to normal when I reinstated the original dose. However , when I tried to come off again last winter, it was an absolute disaster: overnight, I developed horrendous anxiety (on the 8th of February), and when I reinstated the original dose of AMT a few weeks after, it did not subside. I&amp;#39;m now at a higher dose of AMT than I was originally and still suffering all day every day (3 months after the onset).  It is debilitating, exhausting, and there is no saying how long it will last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this happens in a minority of cases, and most people are able to taper off over a matter of months, my message to anyone on psyche meds wishing to come off is please, really do take your time. &lt;strong&gt;never more than 10% of the dose per month,&lt;/strong&gt; and towards the end of the taper, slow down to 5% of the dose per month. The risk of a protracted withdrawal really isn&amp;#39;t worth taking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people on here who may already be suffering please feel free to find support on the forum below (also includes Benzos withdrawal advice): there are some doctors and many experienced withdrawal veterans who know how to help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.survivingantidepressants.org""&gt;https://www.survivingantidepressants.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more advice I wish I&amp;#39;d known:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The reason why it&amp;#39;s important to leave 4-6 weeks between dropping dosage is that withdrawal symptoms don&amp;#39;t usually appear over night. It usually takes days and sometimes up to a month or so after. if you have decreased the dose again in the meantime you&amp;#39;re just fucking yourself over even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-As soon as you start experiencing withdrawal symptoms, or symptoms that you had never noticed before, stop the taper, and go back up one dose. If you wait and see, it may go away, but if it gets worse, the longer it goes on for, the lower the chances reinstating the med will actually work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-A successful taper isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;I got off this med in X weeks&amp;#39; - it&amp;#39;s a taper where you don&amp;#39;t suffer. take your time, look after your mind. Listen to your body: if the quality of your sleep deteriorates, your sex drive goes, you lose your appetite, something is not right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Don&amp;#39;t move too quickly when you have stabilised. Just because you don&amp;#39;t have withdrawal symptoms anymore after reinstating the dose doesn&amp;#39;t mean your mind is fully repaired. Give it a few months without any symptoms before you continue with tapering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely think Moderators should stick a permanent post on this (will leave up to them to write but happy to help a bit if needed). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone the best of luck&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Well I made a whole post that dissappeared and the fact of thinking I might have posted it somewhere else gave me more anxiety.

I've posted before and I need to say: I do therapy and English is not my first language.

My story is like this: I've suffered from TCAs for the past 12ish years and anxiety disorder.

Never had a boyfriend until I was 26. I felt unattractive and not mentally prepared to do so.

My first boyfriend wasn't a good experience. I told him everything (which I probably shouldn't have) and he used that to manipulate me. He made me feel bad with myself, doubt everything I said, he was mean and destroyed the little confidence I had built over the years. When we broke up he said: you should have known and trusted your instincts.

But I know better, if it where for ""my instincts"" my friends think I'm a burden, I'm not pretty or smart enough for anyone, I say more things than I should and I'm usually wrong. But my instincts are controlled by anxiety.

It took a year to heal from that and I sarted seeing this guy, that I really like. But now I don't know how to deal with my anxious thoughts, I ask him if he really wants to meet me or if he doesn't dare to tell me he doesn't want to. And other things like that. I'm scared of pushing him away, because I can't stop thinking he might not like me and I'm terrified of someone breaking me again.

Today I feel extremely anxious thinking he is distant because of something I said and I'm not sure if he is distant or I feel like that. I feel like I have to guess what he is feeling or I should trust my gut. But do I?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted before and I need to say: I do therapy and English is not my first language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is like this: I&amp;#39;ve suffered from TCAs for the past 12ish years and anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never had a boyfriend until I was 26. I felt unattractive and not mentally prepared to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first boyfriend wasn&amp;#39;t a good experience. I told him everything (which I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have) and he used that to manipulate me. He made me feel bad with myself, doubt everything I said, he was mean and destroyed the little confidence I had built over the years. When we broke up he said: you should have known and trusted your instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know better, if it where for &amp;quot;my instincts&amp;quot; my friends think I&amp;#39;m a burden, I&amp;#39;m not pretty or smart enough for anyone, I say more things than I should and I&amp;#39;m usually wrong. But my instincts are controlled by anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a year to heal from that and I sarted seeing this guy, that I really like. But now I don&amp;#39;t know how to deal with my anxious thoughts, I ask him if he really wants to meet me or if he doesn&amp;#39;t dare to tell me he doesn&amp;#39;t want to. And other things like that. I&amp;#39;m scared of pushing him away, because I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking he might not like me and I&amp;#39;m terrified of someone breaking me again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I feel extremely anxious thinking he is distant because of something I said and I&amp;#39;m not sure if he is distant or I feel like that. I feel like I have to guess what he is feeling or I should trust my gut. But do I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: how do you manage anxiety and dating? How can I tell what&amp;#39;s reality from what my brain tries to convince me of? How do I not push people away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, excuse my English.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I had brought it up with my family doctor. She said it was possible. Got sent to a psychiatrist, and after one conversation, was told I probably wasn't autistic; yet, I have autistic ""tendencies"", characteristics of someone with autism. The main reason which I was given was essentially that I was able to comprehend/understand everything they were saying and capable of holding a meaningful conversation. Also, I was a little ""too smart"" to be autistic (paraphrasing) considering I was identified as gifted as a child. On a side note, I've read that that often correlates with autism...

So, I wasn't told ""no"", I was told ""I don't think so"". I was also told that they couldn't diagnose me as autistic in one visit. Was I invited back? No. I felt dismissed. But I left that place with an answer, right? ......I'm not autistic.

*That* is what confounded me. I imagine for many, being told they *are* autistic is hard to hear. And those feelings are **completely** valid. But I think mine are too - it was hard to hear that I'm *not*.

If I'm not...

Why does a change in plans become unbearable for me? Why do I need to know every detail of every plan to placate my intrusive subconscious? Why do I get so anxious and frustrated when something doesn't work out as I imagined it? Why do I remember THE MOST random-ass facts about certain topics. Why do I have such a hard time identifying a joke? Why am I so easily the target of having my ""chain yanked"" (because people know what reaction they'll get out of me obviously.) Why does sarcasm often befuddle me?

Hey, what if I say that I am?

Self-identifying as autistic helps me explain to myself and others why I have these tendencies. ✅ It gives me a diving board to jump off of, searching for the best way to live my life in spite of these tendencies, and the best way to tackle them. ✅ It allows me to participate in this community which shares tips and resources that help me greatly. ✅ Me. Someone who is ""not autistic"". Why would it help me then? 

I feel at peace. I don't feel disabled or pigeonholed by the label. I feel self-assured. I feel confident. I can conquer the world despite (because of?) autism! It's not a bad thing. That's why it doesn't bother me; moreover, why it takes a weight off my chest.

,Anxiety,"I'm very new to posting to reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. (I'm also sorry if this is long) I feel like I'm going through a mid-life crisis at 22. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression back in middle school. I feel like I can't really talk to anyone. I have been recently unemployed amidst the pandemic (as of Feb 2nd, 2021)  and my partner of almost 6 years works at a hotel. I have a very high anxiety about disappointing people around me or people being mad at me. During this pandemic I feel as if my partner has become completely uninterested in me and doesn't want to be around me and that terrifies me. I feel like a loser even talking about all this. At home they have headphones in most of the day and I feel bad trying to talk to them because I'm so scared of making them angry at me but I also don't want them to feel as if I don't care because I do very much. We don't go out much at all anymore (other than to their work and back) Most of the day I end up just scrolling social media mindlessly. I just want it to go back to when we went out and goofed around and they enjoyed my company and I don't know how to bring this up to them because I just don't want to upset them because I love them. 
    
  Another thing that makes me feel incredibly anxious is the fact that I can't hold a job. Things always start out great but in the past two years I have been in a vicious cycle of getting a job, getting incredibly anxious about said job within a few months and having anxiety attacks before or during work, causing me to miss a lot, and then quitting or getting fired. This time around, even looking for a job online is causing me dread because I kinda feel like I'm in limbo and have no idea what I even want to do. 

While I've been incredibly low energy for weeks, I can't  seem to get any sleep either which is really annoying since I drive my little brother to school and my partner to work every morning and have to wake up at 7:35 a.m.

(I&amp;#39;m also sorry if this is long) I feel like I&amp;#39;m going through a mid-life crisis at 22. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression back in middle school. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t really talk to anyone. I have been recently unemployed amidst the pandemic (as of Feb 2nd, 2021)  and my partner of almost 6 years works at a hotel. I have a very high anxiety about disappointing people around me or people being mad at me. During this pandemic I feel as if my partner has become completely uninterested in me and doesn&amp;#39;t want to be around me and that terrifies me. I feel like a loser even talking about all this. At home they have headphones in most of the day and I feel bad trying to talk to them because I&amp;#39;m so scared of making them angry at me but I also don&amp;#39;t want them to feel as if I don&amp;#39;t care because I do very much. We don&amp;#39;t go out much at all anymore (other than to their work and back) Most of the day I end up just scrolling social media mindlessly. I just want it to go back to when we went out and goofed around and they enjoyed my company and I don&amp;#39;t know how to bring this up to them because I just don&amp;#39;t want to upset them because I love them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes me feel incredibly anxious is the fact that I can&amp;#39;t hold a job. Things always start out great but in the past two years I have been in a vicious cycle of getting a job, getting incredibly anxious about said job within a few months and having anxiety attacks before or during work, causing me to miss a lot, and then quitting or getting fired. This time around, even looking for a job online is causing me dread because I kinda feel like I&amp;#39;m in limbo and have no idea what I even want to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;ve been incredibly low energy for weeks, I can&amp;#39;t  seem to get any sleep either which is really annoying since I drive my little brother to school and my partner to work every morning and have to wake up at 7:35 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like everything is going way too fast and I have no time to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, and if anyone has any advice at all it&amp;#39;d be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"For the past 6 months I have been EXTREMELY anxious and depressed (panic attacks, crying 5+ times a day), tightness in chest, tummy issues... 

the last 2.5 months I’ve had a very weird physical group of symptoms: tension headaches, tightness at front of face, very brain foggy, difficulty concentrating, head pressure, at some point feeling like I’ve been roofied (I can’t even string together a sentence), feeling completely disoriented/off. It’s constant. 

I’ve had MRIs, cat scans, many blood tests.. 

I’m currently on topamax to help with the headaches but I’m realizing hm.. these may be anxiety related and I maybe should be on an anxiety medication instead. Sometimes I’ll take a chlonazapam and feel A LOT better.

,Anxiety,"Half ADVICE NEEDED/VENTING because I can only do one flair

I realised a few weeks ago that everyone thinks about themselves more than other people, and that helped me to be more comfortable (as I thought everyone saw my mistakes beforehand) but now I am faced with more problems, probably an inferiority complex and anxiety at school. It's one of these things where you can talk about it for hours and still not feel satisfied.

I heard some girls in one of my classes talk about how they're getting part time jobs and how they're going to be responsible and make money, and that got me thinking that even though I thought of myself as mature, these people are clearly actually doing something and profiting from it. Even my friend who is introverted manages to do a lot of things better than me, he's a master programmer and I (literally) have no redeemable qualities compared to him and other people. I know quite a lot about game design and development but even then it feels very minor compared to things that other people can do.

People of my age are probably already losing their virginities, getting significant others and while I'm not actively searching to do that (I did nofap because I thought it was the reason behind my anxiety - and it was, but it wasn't the only reason) I do feel left out because of it. I also overheard a conversation about a group of people my age having a house party and drinking alcohol, and another conversation about people doing drugs and recording their friends doing it because its ""funny"". Again I don't want to do either of these things but part of me just feels that I'm missing out on something, I won't be able to experience some of these things the same way they did.

I also can't speak normally, at home I'm fine and everything but when speaking to people I barely know at school my voice goes super deep and I keep having to repeat myself just so they can understand what I mean, followed by awkward silence. It's not even that I'm saying anything weird. I tried and tried many times with different methods to try overcome this but so far quite literally nothing has come out of it.

I feel that the potential to be better is just there but something is blocking me from doing it, and I need advice on what to do next. I've already tried talking to someone close (no good results), building up my willpower helped somewhat but the problems still persist, I don't want to try therapy because that would mean my parents finding out and no matter what they must not know, I don't want to worry them or make it awkward.

I thought that the solution would be having a close person hug me, tell me that everything will be alright and say the perfect words (not fake, not saying that everything will be fine just for the sake of it and to cheer me up) but I realised that it is no good dwelling on fantasies that won't happen, because the problem will just get worse. 

If anyone is still interested on giving me advice after that eye-jarring wall of text, please tell me something more practical to do, something that will actually help and not these fake reassurances that it'll be fine/problem will be fixed on it's own, because I am seriously f\*\*\*ing tired of being this depressed and wanting attention, I never used to be like this and I want to revert back into that state or improve for it.",t2_4ysqn4bz,False,,0,False,Need help on how to alleviate anxiety since I'm a bit stuck,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,adviceneeded,0,,,False,t3_n5sksn,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620282901.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half ADVICE NEEDED/VENTING because I can only do one flair&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"This might be long. It's my first time posting anything on a subreddit, really. I feel like my friends and family are tired of hearing about it or just don't have anything else to add so I don't know where to turn.

Brief history: I have GAD and depression, I've tried several medications over the last decade. I don't have much of a history with panic attacks, or at least not as I understand the term. Looking back, I do wonder now if some of my episodes were panic attacks, and that I just didn't *really* know that's what they were like until now. My first obvious panic attack with physical symptoms began as I went under for a surgery. I remember reaching for someone and saying something was wrong, then losing consciousness, and it continued the very moment I was conscious again in recovery. I thought something had gone horribly wrong and/or I was dying. I could not breathe, except I obviously could. It felt like endless minutes that I desperately fought for air while clearly getting enough air to freak out. After I left the hospital it didn't happen again. 

Fast forward a few years to April 2nd of 2021. I'm in a clinic about to receive my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I'm actually super excited, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. And I'm not scared of shots, I've had many medical problems and have been poked and prodded and humiliated and in debilitating pain, a needle is nothing. Except when the needle goes into my arm it feels like someone grabbed my heart with their hands and tried to crush it. It was over as soon as it happened, but still alarming. I manage to walk into the observation room to wait out the 15 minutes before I can go, but something doesn't feel right. I'm lightheaded, my chest starts to feel tight and hurt, I fear I'm going to drop dead at any second. I flag down a nurse and she assesses my condition and very kindly tries to assure me, catching on that it's probably anxiety long before I even consider it as a possibility. All the other patients are staring at me, unashamedly interested, or maybe paranoid that it's some sort of reaction they're witnessing. The nurse hovers over me a little too much. I know she means well but this is all making the anxiety worse, so I lie that I feel better and I go home, thinking it will stop when I crawl into my own bed. It doesn't. It lasts for several hours with small periods (under ten minutes) of feeling like it might end soon in between. The next day I'm fine.

I'm fine for about two weeks, and then it happens again. For a full 7 days. If it stops, it doesn't feel like it. It's day and night of heart palpitations and lightheadedness and fear. I listen to TED talks and read dozens of articles and cry and feel like I'm going crazy. I get my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 2nd, expecting it to be even worse because now I'm living in fear of what will happen this time, and my symptoms finally just...dissipate. There's no scary jolt in my heart, and the lightheadedness and tingling and chest tightness subside over the course of the day. I assume this weird episode in my life is over. I feel incredibly stupid, especially considering I wasn't scared of getting the vaccine in the first place. I'm ashamed and think all my friends are probably thinking I'm a hypochondriac. 

I talk to my primary care physician and she suggests we rule out anything heart-related before changing my medicine, because I've always had a fast heart rate. EKG is normal. I still get an appointment with a cardiologist. I go on May 4th, yesterday. Everything looks fine, EKG is normal there too. The doctor wants to schedule an echocardiogram and order a heart monitor to wear for the next 30 days, just to be sure. My good mood goes swirling down the drain because I don't want to do all this. It's taking too damn long. I'm starting a new job on Saturday and I just want to change my meds before it strikes again. I get in the car to go home and start feeling tingly and light headed and I get pissed because, really, honestly? Why? I was fine, and now I'm not? After a low stress doctor's visit? I get through it and tell myself that it will pass, that it WON'T last for hours because I simply refuse, and after an hour or so I feel somewhat okay again, and gradually feel normal. 

This morning I take my little sister to school, eat some breakfast and lie down watching Youtube videos. I'm a little tired so I close my eyes. Light suddenly dances behind my eyelids and my face feels weird, so I open them again. I get the familiar wheezy feeling in my chest (sometimes it's pressure, sometimes it's like I'm short of breath without actually being short of breath), my limbs feel tingly and go numb, and of course, I feel like I'm about to die. I grapple with it from 8:30ish to 11:30ish and manage to fall asleep. I wake up at 2pm still feeling on the precipice and fight my way through it until almost 5pm as I'm typing this now. It's mostly subsided but I'm still lightheaded and anxious. I don't know when my echocardiogram is yet, my next doctor's visit with my PCP is in a week and I start my new job in less than 2 days. I'm currently taking Wellbutrin and Buspirone and it's felt like they were doing nothing for me for a while now, but I haven't had the time or the money to search for an actual psychiatrist and therapist, and weaning off meds and starting new ones is such a PAIN that I've been putting it off, so this is the prize I won. 

How do I get through this when it seems to be happening purely out of fear for the next one? How do I not freak out when I start my job? I'm so afraid of it happening at work, right as I'm starting this job I fought so hard to get all throughout the pandemic.

&lt;p&gt;Brief history: I have GAD and depression, I&amp;#39;ve tried several medications over the last decade. I don&amp;#39;t have much of a history with panic attacks, or at least not as I understand the term. Looking back, I do wonder now if some of my episodes were panic attacks, and that I just didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know that&amp;#39;s what they were like until now. My first obvious panic attack with physical symptoms began as I went under for a surgery. I remember reaching for someone and saying something was wrong, then losing consciousness, and it continued the very moment I was conscious again in recovery. I thought something had gone horribly wrong and/or I was dying. I could not breathe, except I obviously could. It felt like endless minutes that I desperately fought for air while clearly getting enough air to freak out. After I left the hospital it didn&amp;#39;t happen again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years to April 2nd of 2021. I&amp;#39;m in a clinic about to receive my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I&amp;#39;m actually super excited, I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. And I&amp;#39;m not scared of shots, I&amp;#39;ve had many medical problems and have been poked and prodded and humiliated and in debilitating pain, a needle is nothing. Except when the needle goes into my arm it feels like someone grabbed my heart with their hands and tried to crush it. It was over as soon as it happened, but still alarming. I manage to walk into the observation room to wait out the 15 minutes before I can go, but something doesn&amp;#39;t feel right. I&amp;#39;m lightheaded, my chest starts to feel tight and hurt, I fear I&amp;#39;m going to drop dead at any second. I flag down a nurse and she assesses my condition and very kindly tries to assure me, catching on that it&amp;#39;s probably anxiety long before I even consider it as a possibility. All the other patients are staring at me, unashamedly interested, or maybe paranoid that it&amp;#39;s some sort of reaction they&amp;#39;re witnessing. The nurse hovers over me a little too much. I know she means well but this is all making the anxiety worse, so I lie that I feel better and I go home, thinking it will stop when I crawl into my own bed. It doesn&amp;#39;t. It lasts for several hours with small periods (under ten minutes) of feeling like it might end soon in between. The next day I&amp;#39;m fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fine for about two weeks, and then it happens again. For a full 7 days. If it stops, it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it. It&amp;#39;s day and night of heart palpitations and lightheadedness and fear. I listen to TED talks and read dozens of articles and cry and feel like I&amp;#39;m going crazy. I get my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 2nd, expecting it to be even worse because now I&amp;#39;m living in fear of what will happen this time, and my symptoms finally just...dissipate. There&amp;#39;s no scary jolt in my heart, and the lightheadedness and tingling and chest tightness subside over the course of the day. I assume this weird episode in my life is over. I feel incredibly stupid, especially considering I wasn&amp;#39;t scared of getting the vaccine in the first place. I&amp;#39;m ashamed and think all my friends are probably thinking I&amp;#39;m a hypochondriac. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk to my primary care physician and she suggests we rule out anything heart-related before changing my medicine, because I&amp;#39;ve always had a fast heart rate. EKG is normal. I still get an appointment with a cardiologist. I go on May 4th, yesterday. Everything looks fine, EKG is normal there too. The doctor wants to schedule an echocardiogram and order a heart monitor to wear for the next 30 days, just to be sure. My good mood goes swirling down the drain because I don&amp;#39;t want to do all this. It&amp;#39;s taking too damn long. I&amp;#39;m starting a new job on Saturday and I just want to change my meds before it strikes again. I get in the car to go home and start feeling tingly and light headed and I get pissed because, really, honestly? Why? I was fine, and now I&amp;#39;m not? After a low stress doctor&amp;#39;s visit? I get through it and tell myself that it will pass, that it WON&amp;#39;T last for hours because I simply refuse, and after an hour or so I feel somewhat okay again, and gradually feel normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I take my little sister to school, eat some breakfast and lie down watching Youtube videos. I&amp;#39;m a little tired so I close my eyes. Light suddenly dances behind my eyelids and my face feels weird, so I open them again. I get the familiar wheezy feeling in my chest (sometimes it&amp;#39;s pressure, sometimes it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m short of breath without actually being short of breath), my limbs feel tingly and go numb, and of course, I feel like I&amp;#39;m about to die. I grapple with it from 8:30ish to 11:30ish and manage to fall asleep. I wake up at 2pm still feeling on the precipice and fight my way through it until almost 5pm as I&amp;#39;m typing this now. It&amp;#39;s mostly subsided but I&amp;#39;m still lightheaded and anxious. I don&amp;#39;t know when my echocardiogram is yet, my next doctor&amp;#39;s visit with my PCP is in a week and I start my new job in less than 2 days. I&amp;#39;m currently taking Wellbutrin and Buspirone and it&amp;#39;s felt like they were doing nothing for me for a while now, but I haven&amp;#39;t had the time or the money to search for an actual psychiatrist and therapist, and weaning off meds and starting new ones is such a PAIN that I&amp;#39;ve been putting it off, so this is the prize I won. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I get through this when it seems to be happening purely out of fear for the next one? How do I not freak out when I start my job? I&amp;#39;m so afraid of it happening at work, right as I&amp;#39;m starting this job I fought so hard to get all throughout the pandemic. I do all the grounding techniques and tell myself it&amp;#39;ll end soon and it can&amp;#39;t last forever and it still happens, it&amp;#39;s never over in 30 minutes, it always takes an hour to several hours to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I've been struggling with social anxiety for much of my life.

Recently this flared up while I was dating a girl after I met her friends. I got pretty into my head she wasn't interested in me because of it and didn't communicate any of that with her or that I'm socially anxious.

The last time I saw her in person I was so anxious and convinced it was going to not end well that I told her in a sort of weird way that I was in my head and anxious before I left. We texted about what I meant the following few days but ultimately decided to go our separate ways. 

I was really in my head about how much anxiety I had and how out of control my thoughts got. We had a nice time together but now I feel a bit jaded from the experience and am also feeling a bit depressed.

I don't feel like my usual self and don't know what to do. I feel like my self esteem took quite a hit from how anxious I got and how I communicated it. I really like to know where I stand with people in relationships and feel anxiety and rumination just derailed it. 

I'm trying to move on and regain my confidence but am also ruminating and feeling detached and in my head. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

,Anxiety,"I'm sorry this is so long, but I don't know where else to turn. I can hardly function anymore. 

This started with pericoronitis over an impacted wisdom tooth. It was excruciating, and the many doctors I saw were slow to diagnose it and treat it. In fact, the oral surgeon I saw insisted the wisdom tooth *wasn't* the problem and told me to come back in 3-4 weeks for a follow-up. The antibiotic I was on ran out, and then, four days later, the infection was back. The second time around, it was even more excruciating. I had the tooth extracted a month ago, and because I got dry socket, there is this gaping hole in my mouth still. In the meantime, I also had to have a root canal and two fillings, all on the bottom-right side of my mouth. 

All I think about is the infection coming back. This hole in my mouth is like an open wound, and there is so much bacteria in the mouth. I clean the extraction site with salt water in a syringe three times a day. I use a mouthwash for dry mouth. I brush my teeth. But I still have three of my four wisdom teeth. They feel like ticking time bombs. 

I am also seven weeks pregnant, and if the remaining teeth get infected like the first, they will be unable to remove them until the baby is born. So what then? I'll have an infection and excruciating pain for nine months? The infection will burn me out? I have another child and a husband. I cry all the time when I think about dying and leaving them. Not seeing my little girl grow up. Not being here with them anymore. Our lives were perfect before this. Sometimes, I feel like my anxiety is ruining our life.

The pericoronitis caused a terrible taste in my mouth as well as pain. I am so afraid every time I drink water that this taste is going to be back in my mouth. There is a metallic and sometimes sour taste in my mouth, and I think, ""Well, what if that is the precursor to the other taste? The gross, infected taste? What if tomorrow, I wake up, and my mouth is full of that taste? And the infection is back?""

Today, I looked at my bottom-left gum in the back (the opposite side, where I still have a wisdom tooth), and I thought it was separated from the back tooth, and that leaves a pocket. I am so afraid bacteria and food are going to get in, and it is going to get infected. Plus, my gum back there now feels sensitive, as do my teeth. I have trouble opening my jaw all the way because I grind and clench my teeth all night long and because I've had so many procedures done in the last two months.

Plus, the anxiety also hits me at the same time every day: between 3 and 4 PM, when I have to get ready to eat. Eating was so painful when I had the infection. Plus, by 4 PM, all doctors' and dentists' offices are closed for the day, so I can't get in for an appointment if something flares up over night. The ER won't treat tooth issues except with pain management, and I'm pregnant so it's Tylenol only. The weekends are *horrid,* because no dentists' offices are open. The only place to go is the ER, and I've already been twice. They suggested Tylenol and essential oils for pain and Benadryl for sleep. 

I am seeing a therapist twice a week. She suggested affirmations, and in the mornings, those work. In the midst of a panic attack, nothing works. I try to read or play games or watch TV just to get my mind off of it, just to make the anxiety stop, but it's always there at this time of day (4 PM ET), and it just *hurts.* Not only me, but my family, too. 

None of the dentists I've seen can agree on what is causing me all this pain still. One said I need another root canal, and the endodontist said no way, he's not drilling into another tooth for no reason. I've burned through all my goodwill with the oral surgeon because I was in there almost every day right after the surgery, asking him to check for signs of infection. Plus, I went to another surgeon in his practice for a second opinion because I told them straight up that I felt he was missing something, and I needed someone else to look at it. I've had more X-rays and exams done in the last month than I can count. I told myself, ""If there's no swelling, no pain, and no fever, then there's no infection."" Well, I have minor swelling in my cheek, and I still have pain, but I have no fever. But I've read that some dental infections don't cause a fever, but they can still spread quickly into surrounding tissues, which makes them particularly dangerous. 

I'm not even me anymore. My husband and I tried for six months to conceive this wonderful baby, and I can't even be fully excited. I am so afraid of something terrible happening. Another infection. A miscarriage. I can't play with my daughter all day anymore, because the panic just knocks me down. 

Has anyone dealt with anything like this? How did you cope? I just want my life back. 

Tl;dr- I am struggling with the worst bout of Illness and Death Anxiety that I've had in years. This was triggered by a recurring infection, a surgery, a painful recovery process, multiple dental issues, and ongoing tooth and jaw pain. If you have been through this, and you have advice, I would love to hear it.",t2_5y8ahpxc,False,,0,False,I'm having an Illness/Death Anxiety relapse after six years,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_n5pt50,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620275523.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry this is so long, but I don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn. I can hardly function anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started with pericoronitis over an impacted wisdom tooth. It was excruciating, and the many doctors I saw were slow to diagnose it and treat it. In fact, the oral surgeon I saw insisted the wisdom tooth &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; the problem and told me to come back in 3-4 weeks for a follow-up. The antibiotic I was on ran out, and then, four days later, the infection was back. The second time around, it was even more excruciating. I had the tooth extracted a month ago, and because I got dry socket, there is this gaping hole in my mouth still. In the meantime, I also had to have a root canal and two fillings, all on the bottom-right side of my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I think about is the infection coming back. This hole in my mouth is like an open wound, and there is so much bacteria in the mouth. I clean the extraction site with salt water in a syringe three times a day. I use a mouthwash for dry mouth. I brush my teeth. But I still have three of my four wisdom teeth. They feel like ticking time bombs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also seven weeks pregnant, and if the remaining teeth get infected like the first, they will be unable to remove them until the baby is born. So what then? I&amp;#39;ll have an infection and excruciating pain for nine months? The infection will burn me out? I have another child and a husband. I cry all the time when I think about dying and leaving them.

,Anxiety,"My sister and I live in a very toxic environment. My dad harasses my sister and I both but this post is about my sister.

The effect of the harassment has reached a breaking point for my sister where she has panic attacks because of him. She’s barely able to function. Crying constantly, on edge, easily scared, nauseous, not eating, not sleeping. It’s only recently developed as far as I’m aware. I’m looking for advice on what to do here… I’m trying to help her best I can by reminding her it’s gonna be ok, it’ll get better, encouraging her to breathe deeply, helping her out with getting food and being available and near her.

We mostly stay in her room. We don’t feel free to leave it because of my dad. We only go outside of her room if we hear my dad isn’t and even then, tip-toe around so as not to make our presence known. But I am the person to go out there if needed because it’s too anxiety-inducing for my sister.

She feels there’s no end to her suffering in sight. She feels inconsolable and not able to be helped because it is endless anxiety and panic. She can’t relax and hasn’t been able to for a week. But even then, it is impossible to fully relax here. We cope through distraction and isolating ourself in every way. But that only helps so much.

Our home life has always been rough. Damage recovery and survival mode is the norm here. My mom and my sister have been a target for him to insult and degrade and belittle and harass for as long as I can remember.

But despite all that, I’ve never seen my sister like this, the point of barely functioning. She doesn’t seem well at all and I just really need help. I don’t know what to do. How can I help her to feel better? She’s in pure survival mode. She needs to eat and sleep. Every thought about our dad and every interaction is so anxiety-inducing and panic-inducing she almost throws up.

She keeps it really loud in her room so she doesn’t hear my dad shouting at my mom or if he knocks on her door but I feel like it isn’t helping her. She says it’s made her feel more anxious because it’s so loud and I would guess it doesn’t help her sleeping either but she keeps it, and the loudness must stay because she can’t be able to hear what’s going on outside her room. The loudness helps her feel protected. So she hates the loudness but also feels she needs it is what I’m trying to say.

Talking to my dad about this is not an option. I’m not going to go into too many details because it is simply just too much and too triggering and just generally so exhausting and feels like a waste of energy to talk about him. But just know it’s like dealing with a child bully and so talking to him about basic decency is not an option.

,Anxiety,"Hello,

I started my first year in the medical school of my dreams after years of hard work but I’m now looking into the possibility of dropping out.
My anxiety has worsened and despite loving the degree, my anxiety is becoming a very big barrier and it is sucking out every inch of enjoyment . My engagement in the classroom has been abysmal. I don’t think I ever spoke more than 2 sentences in the last two semester. At the beginning, I did try but my attempts at becoming more social and less anxious were futile, so at the sight of any problem I would hide which has left me looking like an outcast. This is not the kind of behaviour you’d like to see in a doctor and feel so incompetent. I truly don’t think I’m equipped anymore. 
Within my cohort, we are separated into groups of 10 and I am the one who doesn’t speak at all. It is downright triggering seeing everyone on one side of the room whilst I’m on the other trying to figure out how to engage with them after so long. My anxiety is triggered by abandonment issues, so feeling isolated and separated is a concoction for an anxiety disaster. 

I am Dropping out. However, I know for a fact that down the line I’d hate myself for making that decision and can see myself falling into depression.

But now I feel as if it's not a problem anymore. I know I still have my social anxiety and I'm fully aware of the depressions is causes. 

But I feel like an imposter.

Everytime I've started getting serious about getting help in the past I've started feeling like an imposter which has caused my to back down from getting help.

Yesterday I had a rutine year one health checkup at school. And I talked about my problems. First time I've ever opened up and I had no issues talking about my feelings.

But now, I feel like I've lied. But I know I haven't.

Think of it like this.

Bob is a cop, he thinks ""I wouldn't have any problems shooting someone to save a life.""

Next thing you know, Bob has to shoot someone to save a life. Bob never mentally recovers and eventually quits the force.

I feel like everytime I start thinking of getting help. I become the Bob before he shoots someone. I minimize my problems to the point where I cannot even relate to myself.

It's like I keep shooting people to save lives(could've picked a better analogy), but as soon as I've gone through that hell, I forget it, and repeat it. Making it difficult to open up.

,Anxiety,"i made a post a while back, and i mean a *while* back, about how my main anxiety symptom was anxiety nausea and vomiting. it seriously was debilitating and i was avoiding situations that triggered it. i did a few sessions of talk therapy and was given some tools to combat it and thought i’d share: 

(note: i am in no way saying that therapy is a cure for anxiety or that everyone needs to seek therapy. it’s not one size fits all!)

my therapist told me that the nausea and vomiting from anxiety is rooted in a “reset pattern” my anxious brain was trapped in. so when i’d feel anxious, my brain and body would try to purge to reset, like advanced fight or flight. but the anxiety does that because it feels like it’s reacting to an actual danger. i’d get anxious, puke (not willingly), feel better for .02 seconds because my body *thought* it had made itself safe again, but it’s a cycle. my brain was being trained to think that the nausea and vomiting was a necessary part to calm myself down. (insert clown emoji here)

it took work, but i had to manually change that step and talk myself down instead of accepting that i had to feel sick in order to get through the anxiety. so i chose breathing exercises. 4 second inhale, hold, 5 second exhale. until i felt the nausea pass (so however long i needed to do it). i was told that you can really choose anything that you know will get your mind off of it: reciting the alphabet, counting, doing push ups, wall sits, planks. anything that requires some sort of mental/physical focus. after a couple times doing that, i felt like i was able to break back out of the nausea creeping up instead of letting it consume me. now, i feel like i don’t experience the nausea much as a main symptom because i’ve retrained my way of picturing the “reset”. if i feel anxiety starting to build, i take a moment to step back and “reset” and where, before, it’d be dry heaving and feeling sick until i could calm down, now it’s taking a break and doing several rounds of breathing, maybe even focusing on different sensations in my body, to reground myself.

,Anxiety,"I apologize if there’s any triggers in this, I’m not sure what all is considered a trigger.

Monday morning probably around 1 am I was trying to fall asleep and I’m not sure what happened. I don’t know if I truly did have difficulty breathing or if my anxiety caught my breathing slowing down because of trying to fall asleep. When I noticed, I had the most major panic attack. Probably the worst one I’ve had in my life (and I’ve had billions lmao) it made me feel like I was dying of a heart attack. 

So, later that day I went to the emergency room. They ran a EKG on me which the result came out normal. Chest x-ray also came out normal. Of course, my anxiety was not satisfied with the result. I was still anxious they missed something because they didn’t do no blood tests or even a urine test.

Yesterday I ended up being anxious/paranoid about a possible blood clot due to me remembering how my legs have been sore lately for the past 2 to 3 weeks and how a certain spot on my lower right calf is tender to the touch. It sent me to a panic mode so I called my insurances nurse hotline and she suggested to go back to the emergency room again.

After waiting hours and finally getting seen, they did a ultrasound on both of my legs. You’d think I’d feel better after that, but I don’t (the results came back good; no signs of blood clots) I was so anxious if the lady who was doing the ultrasound missed the spot on my leg where it was tender (even though I pointed it out to her. It didn’t feel like she went over it but I wasn’t paying too much attention and I wasn’t looking) nonetheless she did the entire leg from the front view and the area where I was having tenderness. I think my anxiety was just being an asshole to me.

Now I’m anxious she missed the spot and that they missed a blood clot because she didn’t do the specific spot. Honestly at this point my anxiety is getting so out of hand. I have my next psychiatrist appointment this Thursday and I’m really hoping she figures out what I can do.

I just really need support... to know that I’m not crazy for being on edge about my health. I grew up watching family members have severe illnesses and pass away on us. I really think that’s what triggered my health anxiety but who knows. I appreciate any suggestions on what to do to calm down these thoughts.

Been really overwhelmed the past few hours over what I'm sure is a very stupid reason, so I thought I'd post here to see if someone could just say whether I'm needlessly worrying or not.

I have a driving lesson tomorrow, but my girlfriend has asked me to come to a flat viewing with her (she's been looking for ages and it's the first one she's found), she is worried as it's in an area she doesn't know with people she's never met so she wanted me there. Problem is that the viewing directly clashes with my driving lesson, so I have to choose. The other issue is that I've already had to cancel 2 lessons over the past 3 weeks (1 time I paid for the lesson, one I didn't have to). I'm wanting to cancel my lesson tomorrow but I'm really worried that my instructor is going to turn around and drop me from lessons with her. I'm prepared to pay for the lesson still.

,Anxiety,"So I have awful anxiety as well as a panic disorder. Sometimes I get spontaneous panic attacks for no reason. I work for a RV dealership and occasionally we rent out a large football stadium and have an RV show. My job is to wash and detail RVs, so my work sent me to the stadium to wash and detail our RVs. We use a work truck fitted with a power washer and I drove this truck almost 30 miles to the football stadium.

About 3 hours in I had a huge panic attack and tried to fight it off. I could not calm myself down, so I decided to go home. When I panic, my social anxiety reaches it's peak and I usually cannot speak to anyone. Therefore I left our RV show without telling any of my managers. I planned to arrive at home and then call HR and explain what happened.

Of course, coincidentally, my boss began calling me over and over the moment I arrived at home before I had a chance to contact anyone and explain anything. My manager is someone I respect and is very chill but he was FUMING that I left the RV show without telling anyone.  Apparently they needed the truck really badly as well (which is something I was not told).

 I said I left because of a medical issue and my manager immediately asked what happened. I explained that I had a panic attack and could not speak to anyone so I went home. I asked if he needed a doctor's note and he said yes. I called my doctor's office and they said they would call me back later. I'm now freaking out because my doctor's office takes forever to do anything. I don't know what to do if they don't call me back today and I'm concerned I will be fired because I'm frequently late (due to anxiety).

Overall I feel like absolute and utter shit. No one takes mental health seriously these days. I have made immense progress with my mental health and this job is the first job I've held for over 5 months in a very long time. I've also been clean for over a year. I've made so much progress but my mental health always fucks something up. I honestly don't know what to do, I'm sure my manager thinks I'm lying about everything.

TL:DR I left a work outing because of a panic attack. I drove the company car to the outing and then parked it back at my home store.

,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

We are conducting a study as part of our Master's degree at Lund University. This study aims to investigate relationships between emotion perception and different forms of anxiety, and is very important in gaining more knowledge in this field. The study consists of some questions prior to a fun reaction task!

This study has to be done on a **computer**, since it cannot be performed on a mobile phone. The study should take about 15-19 minutes to complete.

If you have any questions or feedback on the study, please feel free to reach out to either one of us! Are you interested in helping us gain more insight in the mechanisms of anxiety? Then click the link below:

,Anxiety,"I’ve (30f) been taking Zoloft for almost two years- it has been amazing in the sense that I kept going to the ER several times a week truly thinking I was dying. I was dx panic disorder and went on Zoloft. It helped TREMENDOUSLY with my anxiety, me thinking I was always dying and just gave me that little pep I guess. I stopped worrying about dying every 5 seconds. I took it right for the majority of the time but the last month or so I’ve been really inconsistent. 

For a sleep study I have to do, they want me off all of my meds for 3 weeks for a sleep study to be “purists”. I’m also on midodrine for my POTS, but I absolutely can’t and won’t get off of that. It’s my lifeline currently. Since I’ve been off the Zoloft completely for the last 9 days (I stupidly went cold turkey because I’ve been so busy I hadn’t thought about taking it) and I’m in *so* much pain. I’ve had headaches, anxiety is rearing it’s ugly head back. I’m in constant body pain, moreso after I stopped. 

Today I had such unbearable stomach pain in target that I kind of dissociated in the middle of the aisle. I didn’t know where I was or how to get out, I was just trying to breathe through the pain- I didn’t remember the last 5 min. I just booked it and left. I was wearing kind of tight high waisted leggings. I got a severe pain above my belly button, nothing has ever been found but this occurrence was the worst. I wasn’t able to say “did you know it’s cinco de Mayo” but I heard myself say something out loud that didn’t make sense with what I thought I was saying. I felt SO weird, like spaced out thinking I was dying.

I was dx panic disorder and went on Zoloft. It helped TREMENDOUSLY with my anxiety, me thinking I was always dying and just gave me that little pep I guess. I stopped worrying about dying every 5 seconds. I took it right for the majority of the time but the last month or so I’ve been really inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I was added to a groupchat because I'm on a university society committee next year (I joined in an attempt to help my social and generalised anxiety but I'm already regretting that decision big time) 

there were already messages in the group chat when I noticed I had been added talking about when to hand over between new and old committee cos everyone is busy with exams. Everyone (both old and new) had put in when was ideal for them. 

This was a few hours before I had even seen the messages but I thought I should let them know when I was free, most people have read my message but nobody has responded. 

Part of me knows this isn't a problem, if was the other way around I wouldn't feel the need to reply to each person and would just wait till   everyone had given dates and then decided when to hand over. 

But I can't stop checking my phone to see if anyone has replied or posted in the chat at all. I feel sick with anxiety that I've made a fool of myself somehow.

 I keep thinking 'what if they didn't need the dates you were free' or 'what if you've read the messages wrong and they were organising something else' even though I know this is completely stupid and irrational. I'm 20 years old, I shouldnt be feeling like this over a bloody groupchat

,Anxiety,"My story: I moved from Orange County, CA to Las Vegas, NV September of last year. I got a new job teaching from home. About 4 months ago I started experiencing anxiety, insomnia, and depression. I have no idea why.

I’ve tried SO many things: meditation, supplements, CBD, no electronics 1 hour before bed, get out of bed if I can’t sleep, etc etc. I’m seeing a therapist, but I’m not sure how effective she’s being. My doctor put me on an ant-depressant (Zoloft) but after just 4 days I got off because the side effects were too bad. Then the anxiety/insomnia got worse from there. I’ve gone whole nights without sleeping and it scares the shit out of me. My anxiety goes up when it’s close to bed time. Xanax is the only thing that works now, but I know I can’t take it for very long. I’m planning on getting a different job outside the house as I’m wondering if part of the problem is being inside all day by myself without any social interaction.

,Anxiety,"Content Warning: Emotional Child Abuse (briefly) and various illnesses and injuries.

My partner has anxiety, though not diagnosed, a lot of it is focused on her health. She also comes from an abusive family where she was made to feel as though her genuine health problems, such as a hernia, were hallucinations and that she was crazy.

A few times I have noticed that she will begin worrying about something, and then later that day or the next day, will complain about said problem.

Most recently, she went for a run on Sunday morning, first time in a while. On the day, she said she had to stop the program of eight 1 minute runs a little early because she forgot to take her asthma pump before running. Later that evening she said she had a slight ache in her legs, and that was it. Last night she mentioned an event about 2 months ago where she had twisted her ankle and it was very painful. She was talking about how that pain might be caused by muscle problems, weak bones, some type of cancer. Then today, around midday, she tells me she is getting that same pain in her ankle though only the beginning stages so its not that bad yet. She hadn't mentioned feeling that at any time prior to midday Wednesday, since running Sunday morning. Ive done a fair amount of running in my life, and Ive never had a pain take that long to develop after a run.

That isnt to say I think she is making it up. Not at all. I'm just worried it could be caused be the anxiety somehow. Could worrying about it make her feel the pain? Could it be a mild twinge that she perceives as much worse? Could it be that by worrying, she unconsciously altered her gait to ease off the ankle, but in doing so has caused pain in the ankle? At the same time, it could very well be a physical problem causing the pain. Whether from running or something else. 

I don't know what to do. If it is caused by the anxiety, would going along with it be enabling the anxiety? (Which my research says is bad). But if it is a physical problem, questioning whether it is anxiety related brings up a lot of stress from the abuse from her parents, and also doesnt help fix the problem.

I hope I don't sound ignorant. I am learning what I can but I am still somewhat new to all this and I want to be the best partner I can be for her.

,Anxiety," I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder a little over five years ago, at the age of 16. I had already strongly suspected it since throughout my childhood and early teenage years I was always shy and scared of social situations. I could never make friends unless someone talked to me first and it’s still like that to this day. 
 
 I strongly envy those who can talk to others with ease, who can make friends everywhere they go, who don’t feel sick during social situations. People have often told me that they thought I was a bitch or that I didn’t like them at first simply because I didn’t talk to them and/or during our initial conversations, I would speak in a quiet monotone. 

I truly wish I wasn’t like this. I wish I didn’t come across as a bitch, because most of the time, I’m just having anxious thoughts that are preventing me from acting how I want to. From being able to actually engage in good conversation and come across as someone with a friendly personality. If I try just a little bit to step out my comfort zone, I feel almost as if I’m going to pass out. Sometimes I mess up on my words or I stutter. It’s so embarrassing. I think so much and I say so little. :/

I just want to overcome this. The only things that help are alcohol and some other substances, but I know it’s not healthy to be doing those every day. It kind of sucks when I meet someone while intoxicated and meet them again when sober and they see this anxious, quiet individual who was nothing at all like the happy, fun girl they met. I wish I was that version of myself all the time and that I could find a way to bring out that part of me when sober. I’m currently in therapy for this, but it hasn’t been much help yet. 

I just think about too often how I could’ve had a bubbly, outgoing personality but instead was born with this one. I’ve spent far too much time envying those who have the personality I desire that it’s taken a significant toll on my mental health overall. Social anxiety is goddamn awful and I’ve missed many opportunities because of it. 

I just truly want to overcome it. I’m still young so there might be a chance but damn, I get anxiety simple thinking about attempting to work on it more.

,Anxiety,"Hi! I just had a very good therapy session yesterday and I felt like reflecting a little on my journey. I thought I could share it here and check if anyone relate. Maybe it can help someone? I don't know ahah. 

I have an anxiety disorder. Diagnosed a year and a half ago, but I struggled with myself since puberty. I am 28, so while mental health was starting to be more known, I was raised by parents that didn't have all the tools to identify that I needed help. Since then, both my parents were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and my family now talks openly about this, medication, therapy. I have younger brothers and sisters (the yougest being 16 years younger than me), that seem to also struggle but are getting help right now. Which I find amazing!! 

I have always been fighting against myself, and trying to reach MY ideal. Someone who is happy most of the time, balanced, sexually active with my partner (I have a low libido due to my issue, medication, etc), the best of friend, the best sister, an accomplished professionnal in my field, etc. 

I saw (and still do to a certain extent) my anxiety as an obstacle to be the best version of me. I have lost friends and isolated myself at many different points in my life because it was too much. 

So, a year and a half ago, I get my first medication prescription. I started therapy last year. The initial goal was to get rid of my anxiety, work on who I want to be. 

I think that the biggest surprise for me was to get to the point where, yesterday, I expressed to my therapist how proud I was that I was able to now accept that the «ups» were not a permanent thing. That my mood is cyclical. In the last year, instead of becoming this person I want to be, I started getting to know myself better, be able to reflect on what happened after a bad month (by exemple). I started appreciating the good times as moments to be more social, be a more invovled partner, etc.  

I stopped talking about what I could be, who I will be, with my partner. I focus on how I am right now, and what I am trying to do to be at peace with myself.  I don't feel like fighting against ME anymore, I want to know me, I want to take care of me, and I want to love me in the moment. 

In the end, I am not becoming who I wanted to be. I am becoming much more counsious of who I am, what helps when Im having an anxiety attack, what are my limits, how to be patient with myself when I can't perform my many roles as well as I wish I could. 

Instead of clinging to the good times and be scared about the next bad one, I appreciate them much more.

Maybe I will always struggle with my mental health. Maybe that's a part of who I am. And that is okay. I am not meant to be the strongest, funniest, most involed and professionnal woman. I am me, and I am worthy of love, especially my own.

,Anxiety,"ANXIETY SYMPTOMS

When you want to overcome anxiety focusing on specific symptoms doesn't help. Having 20 symptoms doesn't mean you have 20 problems to focus on, you have one - ANXIETY.

So assuming you got a clean bill of health from doctors and you are in the anxiety cycle your symptoms and sensations will most likely be caused by anxiety. 

So just for fun, here are the most common symptoms anxiety can cause. :) MOST COMMON, not even all of them. :) 


Body Symptoms:

•	Agitation anxiety symptoms

•	Allergies and Anxiety; Allergy Problems, increase in allergies (number, sensitivity, reactions, lengthier reactions)

•	Anxiety cough

,Anxiety," 

I (27F) am feeling more down than usual.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so here I am.

I work at a call center for a bank. I make less than $50K a year. I get cursed out, screamed at, and called the most disgusting names, but I cant quit. Its all I have. Its enough to barely support me and my cat. Its getting to the point where after each call, I'm hyperventilating and on the verge of tears. My only friend moved to Japan 3 years ago, and our relationship has been hard to maintain considering the time difference and the fact that we both work 40 hour weeks. We are at the point where we send each other random tiktoks, or like each others FB post but that's about it.

I have a twin sister, but every time we talk she just likes to brag about how rich her husband is and how she doesn't have to work. She's even told me to try getting on dating sites to find someone who can take care of me like she did, but dating sites don't work for me. My anxiety has gotten worse from this job. I tried to find hobbies but they never really stick. I wanted to stream online because i like video gamming, but I cant afford the equipment. Of course i mentioned this to my twin sister, telling her my ideas, my aesthetic and how i wanted to have my stream set and, she immediately went out to buy the supplies to rub it my face. Now she streams online for twitch making almost $700 a month using the EXACT aesthetic and methods i mentioned to her. Now I'm unmotivated to do it. I cant top what she's done with my ideas. I don't see her of my niece and nephew because she lives an hr away, and refuses to come see anyone.

My other sister (23F) is a dancer. She's beautiful, skinny and can easily make $1300 a night, which has opened so many doors for her. She's traveling, appearing in music videos and is even getting booked for celebrity parties. She always jokes that i can do it too but I'm fat, and again- severe anxiety. I don't see her as much because she's always booked.

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. This job sucks, its killing my mood, and giving me crippling depression and anxiety, but i cant seem to find another job with the pay that'll support me. I don't have any hobbies to busy my mind, or any extra money to invest in a hobby so i usually find myself crying, sleeping and working. OH- I've also picked up drinking. hooray, i might be an alcoholic too.

Some things i am proud of is the fact that I've been able to keep this job for as long as i have without either 1) quitting on a whim and 2) finally cursing out one of the customers and getting fired. I've noticed that the depression and anxiety is getting worse. I've dropped 30lbs in the last few months, lost a pretty good amount of hair, and i stopped caring what I looked like. I don't have anyone i can talk to but my cat and I'm sure he's tired of me at this point. My mom and i have never been close and my dad left us when we were younger. 

TBH im very lonely and depressed. I self harm sometimes and I've thought about killing myself but didnt want to be a burden to my landlord for smelling up his unit with my corpse.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to about this, so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at a call center for a bank. I make less than $50K a year. I get cursed out, screamed at, and called the most disgusting names, but I cant quit. Its all I have. Its enough to barely support me and my cat. Its getting to the point where after each call, I&amp;#39;m hyperventilating and on the verge of tears. My only friend moved to Japan 3 years ago, and our relationship has been hard to maintain considering the time difference and the fact that we both work 40 hour weeks. We are at the point where we send each other random tiktoks, or like each others FB post but that&amp;#39;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a twin sister, but every time we talk she just likes to brag about how rich her husband is and how she doesn&amp;#39;t have to work. She&amp;#39;s even told me to try getting on dating sites to find someone who can take care of me like she did, but dating sites don&amp;#39;t work for me. My anxiety has gotten worse from this job. I tried to find hobbies but they never really stick. I wanted to stream online because i like video gamming, but I cant afford the equipment. Of course i mentioned this to my twin sister, telling her my ideas, my aesthetic and how i wanted to have my stream set and, she immediately went out to buy the supplies to rub it my face. Now she streams online for twitch making almost $700 a month using the EXACT aesthetic and methods i mentioned to her. Now I&amp;#39;m unmotivated to do it. I cant top what she&amp;#39;s done with my ideas. I don&amp;#39;t see her of my niece and nephew because she lives an hr away, and refuses to come see anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other sister (23F) is a dancer. She&amp;#39;s beautiful, skinny and can easily make $1300 a night, which has opened so many doors for her. She&amp;#39;s traveling, appearing in music videos and is even getting booked for celebrity parties. She always jokes that i can do it too but I&amp;#39;m fat, and again- severe anxiety. I don&amp;#39;t see her as much because she&amp;#39;s always booked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do with my life anymore. This job sucks, its killing my mood, and giving me crippling depression and anxiety, but i cant seem to find another job with the pay that&amp;#39;ll support me.

,Anxiety,"Hey beautiful people,

so I tried to find discussions to this topic but all I find is phone phobia related. That's not it, I don't mind phone calls myself. But whenever one of my family members gets a call I hold my breath and can't concentrate on my work (I'm 25 and currently living with my parents again due to..youknowwhat).

I just immediately get scared that they are confronted with bad news of any sort. I notice every pause and every slight change in their voice and my heart starts racing. Once they hang up I rush into the room and subtly try to find out what that call was about. And even if they say ""nothing important"" I create the worst case scenarios. Can anyone relate in any way?

I just had to share this with someone and maybe I'd feel better knowing I am not alone.

Love

,Anxiety,"Hey, I made 2 posts recently (only posts on this acc) where I expressed my current issue. Reading them will give you a lot more detailed info about my anxiety regarding this, but the TL;DR version is that I just asked someone I like to stay only friends because I'm not sure I'll be able to love him in the future as much as he loves me now.

As you probably know, anxiety doesn't just stop there. I'm still worried how we'll be able to manage this (if we can, at all), but I also started to think back to past friendships, and it just hit me that I lost all of my 3 closest friends this year (they are either too busy or also have personal or mental health issues and stopped contacting me), and I just had to push away the only person who I could rely on lately. Yes, this latter one was my choice, but that doesn't make it easier to deal with because I do like him more than a friend, I just can't cope with the amount of anxiety my unsure feelings for him give me and I didn't want to hurt him either to just lead him on when I'm not sure about things.

Are there people out there who feel/felt the same? Like you just have no luck finding and keeping people close to you because of different reasons?
I was relatively okay after my closest friend left me and I had to learn how to rely only on myself, but now that I experienced how is it like to be truly cared for again, it just knocked me down to realize I have to build myself up again, and honestly it makes me demotivated to find someone who I can be close to because it's tiring to think about fully opening up to someone who will eventually leave me.

Again, the above mentioned guy is a different situation, I don't blame him for anything, it's my lack of romantic feelings that got in the way there. What I want to express is that I had no friends around me to help me deal with this amount of anxiety, and even though he was there for me, it wasn't much of a help for an avoidant anxious person like me who just ""wants"" to push the source of my anxiety away.

For a few weeks before meeting him, I had pals who I occasionally chatted or played with, and I honestly didn't mind not building a stronger friendship with them, it was good to have casual buddies for when I didn't want to be alone. But right now I just feel like something has been cut out of me again - even though it was my decision with him and we do have some potential to be only friends, but I still need some break from him (which I told him already).

Sorry for this mess of a post, it's pretty therapeutic to write things out of myself, but I'm also keen to get some advice regarding my situation and how to go forward from here. I'm sure I need days or even a week to be able to function normally and think more clearly, time is definitely gonna help me in the long run, but right now I'm still not sure if this was the right decision with him or not, and if I even want to be close to someone again - let it be a friend or something more.",t2_bxrywh3a,False,,0,False,Getting over the fact that there's no one close to me again,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,adviceneeded,0,,,False,t3_n5cunf,False,light,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620239713.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I made 2 posts recently (only posts on this acc) where I expressed my current issue.

,Anxiety,"So, this time on my recent anxiety crisis it seems I got what is called a Globus Sensation. It has been 3 weeks since I first noticed it, with some days where it was almost completely gone, but most days with this annoying persistent feeling.  
  
It started one day before my first therapy, so it has been 3 therapy sessions, and it has been one week since I went to the psychiatrist and started medication (Escitalopram for long term anxiety and depression, and Quetamine for quick anxiety fix).  
  
Last week was tough, it used to be gone after taking a tea before sleep but now it persists even when trying to sleep. Saturday was the worst day, I tried to distract myself by going to a park with my girlfriend and her son and just spiraled down into anxiety and almost suffocated with this shit. Decided to not sleep on her apartment and went to visit my parents.  
  
I cried a lot, talked a lot with my father, and woke up better. Spent the whole Sunday and part of Monday without it (like 90% better).  
  
But yesterday night and today it is back, and it is annoying and distracting as fuck.  
  
I know the medication can take 4, maybe 6 weeks to have full effect, and that even Im not feeling that anxious anymore symptoms can appear and persist. I'm just a little bit frustrated this symptom returned, but hopeful it can disappear in the next weeks.  
  
This symptom is just crazy. I mean, all anxiety symptoms are crazy because they mess with your body in real ways even though it is just your mind and body acting crazy. But this feeling of something stuck in your throat, or that your throat is tense which makes it smaller, and then you just feel the walls of it touching each other even when not swallowing, it feels so REAL, how can I not ""remove"" what is there (an ENT will look and will see nothing wrong), and how is it going to go away out of nowhere?

,Anxiety,"(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine!

,Anxiety,"I have an upstairs neighbor who has been generally loud with his bass-heavy music (he has a subwoofer) and his gaming (on the nights he games, he'll yell randomly throughout the night). I live in NYC. He moved in 2 months ago and immediately started playing bass-heavy music very loudly on a regular basis. After about two weeks of that, I went up to his place and asked him to turn the music down since the music that night was especially loud. He mentioned his bass was turned up and that he would turn it down (which it seemed he did). 

In the weeks since, I've actually noticed an improvement in the noise level compared to those early days and I'm guessing he's making an attempt to be more neighborly and respectful. However, there are still times where he listens to his music loudly for about an hour or shouts during his gaming. Again, this isn't a daily occurrence and happens maybe 3-4 days a week at these short bursts. Sometimes he does this after 10pm but not often.

I'm starting to learn how to cope (headphones) and luckily the noise does not creep into my bedroom (so I haven't lost sleep over this, thankfully) but I'm just wondering what kind of tips you may have for dealing with the anxiety that comes with this. I often find myself on edge when he is home, waiting for the moment he turns on his stereo. I don't want to move because I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a desirable NYC neighborhood.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone!
So my anxiety flared up extremely bad during the pandemic. I wasn’t able to socialize with anyone and it brought me to a very low place. I finally started speaking to a therapist and it has helped so much. She really pushes me to go and do things which has helped so much! I have even gotten to the point where I can talk to random people at a bar without being in a full on panic! This leads me to talk about dating with anxiety!

Pre-pandemic I was able to literally meet up with people I met on tinder or just talk to anyone. Now the thought of even driving to a date or them picking me up makes me feel uncomfortable. Does anyone have any suggestions? How do you tell them you have anxiety with the occasional panic attack?

I’m sorry if this seems like a silly thing to think about, but I’m a 23 year old that eventually wants to meet the one (I’m not in a rush, but I do think about how it will happen when I can’t even talk to a person romantically).

I like to make people laugh and be their friend.

But there are times where i cross the line.


So there was a project for our P.E class that we would record ourselves dancing/exercising to music and it would be done in groups. And they would compile every video of members into one.

I got paired with my friend, I talk to them everyday. 

So when I sent them my video, I first asked to not laugh at it because I'm sensitive and I would later ruminate about it and it makes me feel like I'm going crazy. Also I asked to not give it to other people

She 'promised' not to.

Yet she still did.

I HATE EVERYTHING, WHY DID I EVEN BELIEVE SUCH THING. IM SO STUPID. I HATE MYSELF.

Later, I recieve a text from her friend. He said he 'liked the video' of me and texted me ""idol😍😍😍🥰🥰♥️❤️❤️"" which was obviously a joke.


I later explained why I want him to stop, He finally understood. 

FINALLY SOMEONE THAT LISTENS TO ME! WHAT LUCK I HAVE.

And just a few hours ago, My female friend who I sent the video to, Sent the video again to me and said haha's and a voice message of her laughing.


I fxxking hate this
I fxxking hate myself for trusting someone. Even if they are my friend.


I know some people are gonna say ""well its just a joke they dont mean it""

Well to me it does. It hurts. It makes me feel like sh*t. The one I thought i could trust, Made fun of me, made me feel like trash, made me feel ugly and fat.


I tried explaining to her that I want her to stop.


She just laughed
And laughed
And laughed 

Not giving a damn about what I feel 

I WANT TO EXPLAIN IT SO MY ANXIETY DOESN'T GET WORSE SO I'M NOT GOING TO THE POINT I WANT TO KILL MYSELF.


I JUST WANT MYSELF TO FEEL FINE, THE REASON I BEFRIENDED YOU WAS BECAUSE YOU MADE ME LAUGH, AND I MADE YOU LAUGH.


AND NOW, YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE MY PROBLEMS SERIOUS. 

WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM? 

YES, I MAKE JOKES FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT FEEL ANGER AND SADNESS.

AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO RIP MY HEART OUT.


ANXIETY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU MAKE FUN OF, AND THAT IS A FACT.

IF SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING, DON'T JUST SIT THERE AND THINK ITS A JOKE.

DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE JUST SAD.

THEY ARE SUFFERING LITTLE BY LITTLE EVERYDAY.

IF YOU ARE THEIR CLOSE ONE, ATLEAST DO SOMETHING TO HELP AND TAKE THEM SERIOUS.

JOKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY TO THE ONES WHO HAS IT BAD, CAN MAKE THEM COMMIT S*IC*DE.

BE A GOOD FRIEND, AND BE THERE FOR THEM. LIKE THEY WERE THERE FOR YOU.

&lt;p&gt;When she&amp;#39;s feeling down, I&amp;#39;m there for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when I&amp;#39;m serious, she just laughs at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why,&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Main issues: 
Heavy repression
Fear of loss intruding into my current relationship 

So I lost my mum about 7 years back, when I was 18 years old. 

I was never really the kind to get really emotional. I was always social &amp; energetic but admittedly, I do have some excessive people-pleaser traits. 

Crying isn't natural to me but I was open to it. Losing a parent was a sad enough event to allow myself to cry. After I lost my mum, there was a huge fight within 2 sides of the family in regards to her burial, and I didn't have the space, time &amp; freedom to be emotional or cry. Instead I had to be as tough as I ever could because I was in the middle of all it and the primary decision-maker. 

By the time that was all settled, I had no drive to cry, be emotional or wanna react to her passing anymore. It's as if I was too late to react normally. I didn't feel anything. And that's how it was for the next 6 years. I never really felt anything looking back at her passing, I could talk about it candidly and my closest friends always found it weird how I never spoke about my mum but it was simply because the issue never seemed to surface to me consciously. I was... unknowingly then, emotionally numb to it. There was no feelings attached. It was just an event that happened. 

Up until the recent times, in 2020, I started to feel like I missed her just a little when I entered a down period in my life. And then, my next caretaker, who's been with us for a decade, had to leave us to return to her country and I was mega depressed. We were like best friends, siblings and she was such an amazing anchor of stability in my life. But weeks later, same thing. Numb. I live life at the present as though she doesn't exist. When she calls me every now &amp; then, I can easily dismiss her calls and say ""I'm busy, call me another time"" and be super apathetic toward it with no thoughts or feelings of remorse.

Recently I got into a relationship and my ""fear of loss"" anxiety manifested rapidly and started projecting on my partner. I would walk on eggshells when it comes to avoiding topics she's uncomfortable with or doesn't like, I'd think of every single way to pander to her needs and I'm hyper attentive to when she talks about her likes &amp; dislikes, even her reactions to things. And I'm always begging for repeated reassurances and I can never feel secure despite her expressing in every humanly possible way that she loves me so much and is not going to leave me (and not in an idealistic way, but she also does discuss the realities of relationships and not promising forever which I concur with) 

I can't stay secure for even 3 days in a row and I'm always irrationally scared of losing her. 

As I reflected recently and allowed my emotions to flow, it went from ""why do I always need to please people? What happens if I don't please them or meet their expectations? I would feel like a complete failure. (I asked myself why, it didn't know an answer but I started screaming and throwing over furniture in my own head and a few minutes later my mind said) I'm so tired of losing people!!! (I started thinking of my mum, my caretaker, a girl that ghosted me when it seemed we were getting along during my depression period when my caretaker left) and that's when I realised that that's where it came from and I have repressed so much.

I don't really know what to do now, honestly. It's been 7 years. I really don't want to keep feeling like I'm walking on eggshells just to talk to my girlfriend, getting anxious whenever I reply her and she's not actively there, and also this affecting my mood so badly and affecting my mental health whenever I get into simple conflicts with any of my close friends. 

I'm tired and I wanna know how to move on from here and I need advice.
(I'm already seeing a counsellor so that step is done but I don't know if I have the emotional capability to cry in front of him by sharing super vulnerably even if I tried cause of the numbed emotions, and also I barely have any close friends who I can find a safe space to cry with them in.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired and I wanna know how to move on from here and I need advice.
(I&amp;#39;m already seeing a counsellor so that step is done but I don&amp;#39;t know if I have the emotional capability to cry in front of him by sharing super vulnerably even if I tried cause of the numbed emotions, and also I barely have any close friends who I can find a safe space to cry with them in. So, idk man.)&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have been feeling off for the majority of the day. Even as i write this now i’m laying down in bed cause it’s the only place i feel semi normal or alright.
I was freaking out and having a panic attack just before because the right side of my face/forehead and head itself felt ... odd... wrong. I can’t explain it much more than that. It felt numb and almost like i can’t control anything on that side properly. 
I know it’s my anxiety (least i hope so) but it still makes me panic just the same. 
It makes me feel like i’m going to have a stroke or seizure.. blood clot.. i don’t know just something. 
Anyway - i asked my mum to come sit on my bed with me and talk to me because she’s done it before a couple of times and it helped. 
My panic attacks have only been going on for a couple months but i can already tell she’s sick of it and of me. 
Tonight she got angry at me and sat on my bed and proceeded to yell in my face saying i don’t help myself and no one can feel as sorry for me as i do for myself - and so on.
She said i don’t do anything to change this... i don’t do enough exercise or go out etc.
I feel like i do try. But it’s hard. 

95% of the time i don’t feel good. 
Infact it’s actually hard to remember the last time i did feel good or even “ok”. Most days i’m honestly just spending them trying to get through till the next one and it’s a struggle. 
I just don’t understand why i’m like this and why people around me have to be like that as well. 
All i want is to get better and i’m terrified of taking medication as i already suffer from a few things that they have side effects of and i don’t want to make those worse.

,Anxiety,"Hi,

I hope you're all well. Global pandemics have really put the cat amongst the pigeons for a lot of people's mental health, particularly anxieties, so I'll take this chance before I write my question to remind everyone that you are not alone.

I've been anxious for a long-time. The way I feel is nowhere near as bad as some, although it is becoming a major inconvenience in my life. I am okay 75% of the time, but then minor incidents (for example, why has someone read a text and not replied?) can spark big and quick spirals (are they talking about me? there was that time I did XYZ, are they all going to tell me they don't want to be my friend anymore?). Then I'll be left incapable of doing anything (will sit in bed, sleep a lot, etc.) either until the situation resolves (I get a reply) or until enough time passes that I calm down (double digit hours for minor events, weeks for bigger events).

Simply put, I'm struggling to live like this and it appears to only be getting worse. It has started to impact every area of my life and is seeping out to the people around me.  


1. How do I define what I am feeling? I'm not asking for a medical diagnosis by any stretch of the imagination. But, if you feel similar here, how do you describe it to people around you?  

2. How do I make this better? I'm happy to walk a long-road to achieve this and I'm not expecting any silver bullets that make this all okay by the weekend. I've taken a lot of preventative measures. For example, I drink a lot less now. Does anyone have books they would recommend? Or techniques they learnt that helped?

Thanks a lot - I appreciate your time reading this. I know I'm not the first person to ask for help, but I didn't want to hijack another thread!

,Anxiety,"I have this thing happen to me every so often where (usually at work) I feel out of control of something going on. Its hard to describe. But basically any time that I feel completely overwhelmed or our of control, I get in my head too much and cant handle it.

The physical symptoms usually are limited to sweating/shakiness. But the mental symptoms are what are worse for me. Its like I cant communicate correctly with other people, and constantly second guess my ability to do anything in that moment without screwing it up. I try my best to push through it, but its really, really hard sometimes. It feels like a mental foggy head high, but totally unpleasant.

Its almost like I'm so ""in my head"" that everything else is secondary. Normal behavioral patterns are gone and all I can think about is trying to maintain my composure and not appear to be having any sort of anxiety attack.

To give you an example, I'm a cook by trade, and I work in very prestigious restaurants. Today I was making a recipe I'd never made before which was relatively complicated, and I screwed up part of it and had to re-do it. Just the act of screwing it up triggered this in my brain and I started sweating and not being able to concentrate on things the way I normally would. Most people might not know but as a professional cook, I often have many, many tasks all going on at the same time, and if one of them goes off balance, it can easily throw something else off.

In terms of 1-10 today's was probably a 8 which is the worst as of recently. There is only one other time a few months ago where I had (what i think was) an anxiety attack at work and it followed me home too, it was basically a 10/10-- and again it was a time where I was assigned a task that I was unfamiliar with and thought I wasn't doing it fast enough.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, hope you're having a good day. 
I don't really know where else I can ask, so I'm asking for advice/help here. 
I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by a doctor last September. Been on medication till the last month when my parents decided to cut off the treatment and now I'm on homepathic meds. 
I can safely state that triggers to my anxiety are timed tests. 
Last September I gave one of the most toughest exams to get into uni and that's when the anxiety attacks started. I messed up that exam, but I still got into one of the premier colleges in my country. 
After clg started, I've been having an anxiety attack during every single exam I've taken. What I've learnt isn't reflecting in this grades I'm getting and even the meds aren't working on me, both the meds the previous doctor gave and the current homeopathy meds. Because of me Messing up every exam, my grades are dropping and I don't really know what to do.. apart from usual college studies I need to learn extra skills too but anxiety again interferes and I'm just not learning anything new because of the fear that I won't be good. I'm starting to actually get SCARED of the moment when I'll have an anxiety attack. I avoid everything wanting to just relax and calm my nerves down but that just adds to the anxiety again.

,Anxiety,"Well after my classmate died 3 weeks ago I was so nervous my heart was beating so fast and after that, I'm barely breathing still, I had a stabbing sharp pain on the left side but I can say that I got rarely any stabbing pain now.

I did EKG, blood pressure, blood test, microbiology blood test, 2 docs listened to my heart and lungs, covid test negative, 99% blood oxygen, urine test... And it looks like I got health anxiety after all that. My heart is beating a little faster and my palms are sweaty I mean I always had sweaty palms(i have been always a little bit nervous but the nervousness will go away after I exercise or after I do something to occupy my mind). 

Now I started doing some kind of breathing exercise I read here on Reddit that one dude said.

And he said this too:

""First off it may be because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. The other reason being that your body over breathes when stressed out to get ready for the ""fight or flight"" response. People with anxiety find themselves under constant stress so if you continue to over-breathe over a prolonged period, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as ""normal"".

,Anxiety," **tw: ed; panic attacks**

for context, I have several crippling mental illnesses that keep me from attending school or work, the only regularity in my life is my therapist.

So I've always been on the more self-deprecating side, but recently it has gotten out of hand. Dressing more alternative was always something that made me feel good and safe and it kept me from worrying too much about how I look since I could objectively say that I have a nice fit.

But recently it has just gone away: I hate getting dressed and styling outfits has turned into a pointless game since in the end I will hate every part of my appearance and stay at home in pajamas instead. I tried getting new clothes or changing my style, but nothing helps. Instead, I get regular 3-4 days of disordered eating, leaving me weaker and more anxious than before. it's not like I don't like my clothes, especially my shirts (pants are very problematic), I just don't like them on me.

A while ago my mum forced me to get my meds from the pharmacy and I had a panic attack for like 2 hours

I don't want to lose another thing that I liked to my idiot brain.

any similar experiences or things that helped?

,Anxiety,"I have had really bad anxiety + depression for about 10 years. After doing this exercise, it has almost all gone away completely. No taking any medication either! Please try it out, I really think it can help!!
_____

1. Okay so, sit cross legged on the floor. Back straight.
 Eyes closed. Hands in the praying pose. Good posture. Face forward. 

2. Take deep breaths from your nose, hold it, and exhale from your mouth. Focus your thoughts only on your breathing and imagine the air coming in to your body. Imagine it circulating in your brain as you hold it. Imagine it leaving your body with all your negativity alongside it, as you exhale. The time it takes to breathe should equal the time it takes to exhale. Try and hold for 8 seconds - longer if you can. 

3. Inevitably there will be other thoughts and noise that might be intrusive, and will divert your attention from your breathing. You’ll stop thinking of your breaths and instead on your thoughts. Don’t get mad and try to mute them. Accept them and again divert your attention back to your breathing. I try to look down at my nose when my eyes are closed when I can’t focus on my breathing. Keep yourself in the present. Divert your attention away from past thoughts and future anxiety.

4. Going to be hard at first to bring your attention to your breaths since there’s so many other thoughts, but keep at it. After a few times / sessions, it just comes easier. At first I couldn’t focus at all. I would think “Wow. Am I really sitting here meditating? How dumb is this. What a waste of time."" But now - I can meditate while I walk or watch tv or do anything!

Objective: the past is the past and the future is just anxiety. **Focus on only the present**… Which is your breathing. That is the goal of these exercises. To bring your attention and mind back to your breathing , which is just the present state of what you are doing. We don’t care about what happened in the past, or what might happen in the future. Only thing that matters is how awesome it is to breathe and take long deep breaths and feel that sensation in your body.

Then in the future, when you get depressed or anxious about something, you have a trained mind to bring your thoughts back to the present state, instead of past or future. That is mind control, or mindfulness and it is the way! I hope this helps somebody out!

,Anxiety,"Am I afraid to be happy?

So a little back story. Me 21F and my partner 22M have been together for 5 years. Our relationship is healthy, loving and we do work extremely well. The only thing is that I’ve always suffered massively from anxiety more specifically in the last 2 years health anxiety and well he is a very happy and positive person that very rarely feels anxious or depressed but  still knows how to comfort me in difficult times. 

So fast forward to today and I’m doing amazing on the Health anxiety front, I’m not worrying/obsessing over my health anymore and I can finally say my mind is clear of those things. The last 6 months have been the worst in regards to that and I hate to say that it did take its toll on my relationship, he felt like he couldn’t help me, I was always in a horrible state of worry and panic to the point it crippled me and in the end turned out to be making my partner extremely unhappy. We nearly broke up. He said he thought I needed some help and that if this carried on for much longer he doesn’t want it to change the we he feels about our relationship. This conversation we had really opened my eyes to how this anxiety was effecting my
life, my relationship, my work and even family so I promised to go and talk to my doctor and I did. I was prescribed Zoloft and I’m still waiting for the counselling but I’m in such a better place mentally and feel so much clear minded now and my relationship has been thriving like it did before. 

The only thing now tho is I’m starting to develop abit of anxiety around the fact that my partner makes me so happy and my life right now feels so happy to the point it makes me nervous and almost makes it feel suspicious and I’m noticing that I’m trying to find things that are wrong even when they are not, like maybe how my partner might say or do something and I’m like “is he still happy? And is he just not telling me that he’s not?” Or if someone even talks in a different tone or says something they wouldn’t normally say I’m thinking way to far into things thinking that those things point to something awful.

,Anxiety,"This is a long one, I just needed to get it all out lol. TLDR is at the bottom if you get bored.

After being laid off due to Covid for the better part of a year, I finally landed a job about 2 months ago. Let me just preface by saying that employers have ALWAYS been impressed with my work, and I'm still close with 2 of my former bosses. I'm not what you'd call a problem employee. But this job is easily the worst I've ever had and it's eating me alive.

I was mislead about the salary, hours, and responsibilities, I received 0 training, everything I do is criticized but I never get any feedback on how to be better, I get snide remarks on the daily, and I have to listen to my coworkers get shouted at on a weekly basis by my boss (luckily he hasn't directed that behaviour at me yet). I started looking for a new job after my second day of work. This is all a long way  of saying I have no remorse whatsoever about leaving this job.

I received a fantastic offer earlier this week and of course I accepted. But I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear about submitting my notice. I meant to do it today but I chickened out, so tomorrow I plan on doing it first thing. I'm having a really hard time. I guess I'm afraid my boss is going to blow up at me and throw a tantrum and I really don't deal with confrontation well. I know it sounds childish, but anyone yelling makes my skin crawl even if it's not directed at me. I just panic. And I guess I'm afraid that's exactly what's going to happen tomorrow.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm absolutely freaking out.

&lt;p&gt;I received a fantastic offer earlier this week and of course I accepted. But I&amp;#39;m absolutely paralyzed with fear about submitting my notice. I meant to do it today but I chickened out, so tomorrow I plan on doing it first thing. I&amp;#39;m having a really hard time. I guess I&amp;#39;m afraid my boss is going to blow up at me and throw a tantrum and I really don&amp;#39;t deal with confrontation well. I know it sounds childish, but anyone yelling makes my skin crawl even if it&amp;#39;s not directed at me. I just panic. And I guess I&amp;#39;m afraid that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice? I&amp;#39;m absolutely freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I&amp;#39;m quitting an objectively terrible job that I&amp;#39;ve only held for 2 months because I got a better offer, and even though I know it&amp;#39;s the right decision and I know I don&amp;#39;t owe them anything, I&amp;#39;m really struggling with anxiety about telling my boss because he&amp;#39;s been aggressive in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

how do i manage stressful and anxiety driven situations so my HR &amp; BP don't skyrocket into oblivion? it scares me because i know it's not healthy to stress the heart so much and so heavily. i don't check it for my own good, but today, when i was at the cardiologist to take my blood, i'm sure it went up to 140, give or take. i try to do slow breathing techniques but none of them work. it's like when i'm there (especially at the doctors) there's nothing i can do. it's like my body &amp; mind go into a state of panic. i'm not sure how panic and/or anxiety attacks look exactly. but i turn completely white, i look like i ghost, my breathing is pretty shallow, my HR is through the roof, my voice gets shaky even when i try to hide it. the thing i'm most scared of is going to get a EGK tomorrow and my heart being all weird &amp; jumpy because of this anxiousness. i'm scared that the doctor won't get an accurate reading and might misdiagnose me or something, idk. blood pressure is pretty much perfect at home. my resting HR at home is usually 70-80, when i stand up it usually just goes up by 10bpm. but it goes crazy when i'm anxious, panicky etc.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I've mostly been active on the health anxiety sub, but things have changed a bit and I figured I'd post my question here.

A little over a month ago, I randomly woke up one morning and experienced some new cognitive difficulties. Among other things, I had this strange difficulty reading, which was one of the things that sent me into total panic. The specifics of the difficulty reading are described very well [here](https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/showthread.php?219246-Misreading-words-aware-of-myself-reading) (I did not write this, but this post pretty much nails the problem down precisely).

1 brain MRI, 3 ER visits, 2 primary care visits, numerous meetings with psychiatrists and 1 stay in the psych unit later, I can honestly say that most of the things I had feared have been ruled out completely. I'm still terrified of having schizophrenia (the only fear I couldn't disprove, even though the psychiatrists didn't think I had it), but at least I'm not hauling ass to the ER anymore. This whole thing feels a bit traumatic when I think about it, especially since it occurred so suddenly and I was alone, thousands of miles away from any of my friends or family. It cost me a lot of money, too. I'm just a grad student, I don't have a lot of money and I was trying to save so I could pay off my loans from undergrad, but the medical bills effectively ended that ambition.

The anxiety has died down a bit, but I now have a new problem: I literally cannot get off the couch. It's like, in the aftermath of all of this, I've just stopped being excited about all of the things I'm usually very enthusiastic to do. I often go through entire days where I do very little beyond taking a shower and brushing my teeth. I just can't bring myself to do anything, everything has started to feel like such a...task. I'm staying with friends right now and I have trouble sleeping, and when everyone goes to bed and I'm inevitably still awake, I cry because I just feel like I've lost my spark and I don't know if it's ever coming back. I feel like I'm almost in a pseudo-vegetative state, as if I'm only absorbing like 10% of the stimuli I encounter in any given day.

It's been a month of this now, though really more like 2 weeks because the other 2 weeks were spent with pretty intense anxiety still. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this (specifically the whole ""losing your spark after anxiety"" thing)? I'm not medicated at all, if that's relevant. I was prescribed lorazepam but I'm too scared to even take it (a very cruel bit of irony). It was given to me once in the ER, but I literally can't remember anything after taking it, so that didn't do much to cure my benzo phobia.

,Anxiety,"Hey, so I'll try to summarize things without giving too many specific info but giving enough for you to be able to form an opinion.

I met a guy online a month ago, we started gaming, got closer (all while playing in a squad), our private messages became more flirty and cutesy making it obvious that we're both interested in each other without actually stating it, then some days ago he dropped the L-bomb (to which I honestly answered that I don't feel love yet but I do like him), and ever since then anxiety has taken over me. Waking up anxious, taking 1-2 hours to calm down, barely any appetite and overthinking during the day, then having to calm myself down before sleep too. It's gotten better, but especially when the anxious waves hit, I'm basically gaslighting and questioning my own feelings for him.

What I do know even in this messed-up state I'm writing in right now, is that I like him in the romantic sense, but I'm not sure it can/will be ever more than that. There are some things I'm ""missing"" from him which would make me more attracted to him (personality-wise) and would probably make me fall for him, but there are also things that he has which I like and didn't know I needed this much in a potential partner.

I'm just really torn because I know that I'm not gonna have a crush on just any person if they treat me well and give me love, but at the same time if I compare how I feel towards him and how I felt towards other people who I used to like romantically in the past, it's obvious that I'm missing the spark, the fire. I wouldn't want to lead him on and hurt him if I was sure this can't work between us, but at this point I'm honestly not sure if my mixed feelings are because of anxiety or because it really won't/can't work between us.

I don't think I could describe all my feelings towards him clearly, but here are some moments that can maybe help you guys have more insight:

* When I was anxious (but not all-in anxious) on the first bad day, I had the growing urge to just write him a kinda checking-in message, and I did, even though my anxiety wanted to push him away so much (I did this a few times, didn't wait for his answer but I wrote down how I was feeling and checked what he wrote later).
* When I'm not feeling any anxiety, I want to spend time with him, talk to him, goof around. Sometimes I flirt with him or write a cute message, sometimes he does. When he does it, it's basically 50-50 for me ever since the L-bomb: it either warms my heart and I smile, or it annoys me and starts/worsens my anxiety.
* There's a guy in our group who lately started to act kinda weirdly towards me in PMs, like other than the actually nice and caring messages about my wellbeing, he sometimes calls me hun, writes heart emojis, offers one-on-one playing sessions and things like that... So yeah, like I said, I feel weird about that - on the other hand, (when I'm not anxious) it flatters me and makes me happy when ""my"" guy writes these kinda things to me.
* Like I mentioned before, I miss that kinda excitement, the spark. However, (again, given that I'm not anxious) I feel safe, accepted, loved and cared for around him. He respects and understands when I say I need time/space, and I honestly believe him when he says it doesn't bother him when I'm acting all weird in this anxious state (he didn't call me weird, it's me saying that).
* I'd feel jealous and disappointed if he would flirt with another girl. And however much my anxiety in its lowest point tells me to just cut him out of my life, I can't do that. I wanna fight anxiety for him almost as much as for myself, and I'd feel devastated for both of us if it turned out that I have no chance of loving him romantically.
* Before the L-bomb I just enjoyed my time with him, tried to concentrate on and live in the present. I'm trying hard now too, but it's rare that I can keep a longer conversation with him without getting anxious at one point.

And for the end, I wanna add that this would be my first real relationship (I'm in my early 20s), so at least part of the anxiety is probably because of this. The second thing I wanna add is that I already have an appointment to a consultation with a psychologist, just really needed to write this out of myself now. I kindly ask you to not say anything rude if you feel like this is only platonic love or that it can't evolve into romantic love; I'd never want to hurt him on purpose, that's why I'm desperate enough to post this here. Would be awesome if people with the same core experience (aka not knowing exactly what do/did they feel towards someone) would share their story with me.

Edit: I finished writing this like an hour ago, since then I messaged him and we went into pretty deep topics. I basically told him that I'm not sure about my feelings but I want him to stay in my life, whether as a friend or something more, and he told me some personal things which made me even more scared of how much would it hurt him if I were to cut him off.

,Anxiety,"

Hi i dont rly know how to use reddit but ive come here in hopes of finding help or advice. 

I have a history of anxiety and it’s very easy for me to start overthinking just about anything. I’ve been able, for the most part, to get over things i get stuck on. But im not sure if i can say the same for this time. 

I have a fear of being tortured. Theres not many posts i can find for advice. But the thoughts keep nagging me and i cant get loose from them. 

Just for additional context, i dont take therapy, and i dont follow any religions atm. 

Something thats helped me cope is the thought that torture never lasts forever. Theres always an end to it, no matter how bad it is. The victim will eventually die, or they will be released, or escape or something. Even if they live with PTSD and the awful psychological after effects of torture, they too, will die. Torture can’t last forever- your body will die eventually, even if it hurts. 

Another thing that helps is the fact that the victim may depersonalize. Im not very educated on this topic, and i dont want to make any incorrect assumptions about it, but my interpretation of it is that you somewhat leave your body, like you’re not really there. 

Am i crazy for trying to cope like that? Those two things have been what’s keeping me somewhat at peace, but then i think to myself “no, youre crazy. Torture is awful and you should be afraid of it. The pain ends but the pain exists.” 

I honestly dont know what to do at this point. I havent talked to anyone about it but im afraid to. 

Again, this is my first time posting here, so if ive made any mistakes in what i do please let me know, or if i should make any changes.

&lt;p&gt;I have a history of anxiety and it’s very easy for me to start overthinking just about anything. I’ve been able, for the most part, to get over things i get stuck on. But im not sure if i can say the same for this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a fear of being tortured. Theres not many posts i can find for advice. But the thoughts keep nagging me and i cant get loose from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for additional context, i dont take therapy, and i dont follow any religions atm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something thats helped me cope is the thought that torture never lasts forever. Theres always an end to it, no matter how bad it is. The victim will eventually die, or they will be released, or escape or something. Even if they live with PTSD and the awful psychological after effects of torture, they too, will die.

,Anxiety,"Trigger warning:  anxiety, negativity, and depression

My ex and I met online, never met up irl. I was a 17 year old highschool student and he was a 22 university student. I am still unsure whether it was morally right for him to date me. I'm 19 right now, and I don't even befriend 17 year olds and younger, let alone date them. 

Anyways, a year after our rough break up, we started being friends again. Throughout our short-lived friendship he'd make rude remarks or weird jokes that I didn't like. Anytime I'd point it out to him he would tell me I'm overreacting when all I said was that the remark was rude/weird. He would get very  defensive and dismiss my feelings, then I'd have to explain myself even more, explaining why the remark was rude and why I didn't  like it. He then would apologize. One time we decided to play minecraft together, he purchased a server and refused to let me pay half, although I insisted.  Later on I asked him to do something which required money, so I asked for his paypal email to send him money. He gave it to me and said ""Maybe pay for that minecraft server too while you're at it"". I paid for my half, but told him that he didn't have to phrase it this way if he wanted me to pay half, he started brushing it off as a joke, and I told him that it was a weird joke to make, he started saying that I was overeacting, after an in depth explanation as to why the joke made me uncomfortable, he apologized. At one point he started acussing me of leading him on because I failed to realize that he caught feelings for me, when he never said that he liked me more than a friend, and I thought that we were on the same page about not wanting to date each other. He agreed that he misinterpreted the things I said, and I apologized for failing to realize that he had a crush on me. 

A few days ago I had a mental breakdown because my inhertitance was stolen from me, and I couldn't afford college because of it. He knew about this, and a few days later started telling me how in a year he's going to inherit like 2 million pounds and that it's going to change his life drastically although he grew up in a wealthy family and basically has everything. I told him that I was really not the best person to share this with and that it was inconsiderate. He apologized, but after this incident I decided to end the friendship, especially after finding out that he had feelings for me. A day later he emails me, telling me how I am toxic, negative, and ungrateful. Dedicating a whole paragraph to all the things he did for me, including giving me $150 to fix my computer, at the time he said that I don't have to return that money to him, and now, a year later he asked me for it. I gave it back, and thanked him for it. He knew a lot about me, and he was there during my lowest low, and now he was holding it all over my head in that email. Saying how I had way too many irrational outburts, that I was dramatic, and negative, all with examples. Taking back all of his apologies for the weird jokes and rude remarks. 

 It's been almost a month since I got that email, and I can't stop feeling like other people precieve me as negative, irrational, or toxic. The other day a friend asked me if I liked a certain dessert, and after saying no, I felt toxic and negative. The other day I had cravings, and I felt greedy for eating a whole bar of chocolate. These are the things I feel almost every day, and it's exhausting :c I tried to reach out to him for closure because his words really hurt me, and he told me to stop gaslighting him o\_o He's a psychiatry student, and I feel like he knows what he's doing, but I still can't help myself but feel terrible.

,Anxiety,"I've had a bad phobia of speaking in front of people and it's made it hard to do a few school projects (giving speeches and presentations).

I haven't been able to talk in front of people, not one time. While my anxiety has gotten better, this fear has not. I had a panic attack in front of my class once becuase my english teacher tried forcing me to do it. He ended up letting me do an alternative because I physically couldn't do it.
At my old school I literally ran out of a class because I couldn't surpress my fight or flight instinct anymore and so I just ran.

Today me and a group had to give a presentation and I was a wreck all morning. My hands were constantly shaking and I was trying to surpress my panick attack during 1st period, but I had a meeting with my teacher and just broke. My teacher tried his best to comfort me, but I was still shaky and trying to hold back another panic attack.
During 3rd (when we had to give the presentation) I had the worst panic attacks ever while I was practically begging my teacher to not have me stand up there. The mere thought of it almost sends me into a panic attack, so being in a group of people that I didn't like and having to talk in front of so many people that I didn't know and/or like was worse.

I felt so pathetic as I was sitting there, crying and shaking, begging this teacher not to have me do it. He acted like I was faking it or something, but eventually gave up and let me not do it. He wasn't sure whether to give me an F or what, since he didn't have any other work planned since he wasn't expecting anyone to sit it out.

I was so worn out, mentally exhuasted, and tired the rest of the day becuase I had to fight through several panic attacks and twice as many anxiety attacks. I am still having an anxiety attack because it's really hard for me to heal from stuff like that.

He wasn&amp;#39;t sure whether to give me an F or what, since he didn&amp;#39;t have any other work planned since he wasn&amp;#39;t expecting anyone to sit it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so worn out, mentally exhuasted, and tired the rest of the day becuase I had to fight through several panic attacks and twice as many anxiety attacks. I am still having an anxiety attack because it&amp;#39;s really hard for me to heal from stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is long and I&amp;#39;m sorry, but I just wish I was able to get over this fear, and I wish people (especially teachers) understood how severe and terrrifying anything like this can be. Even minor panic attacks can be so terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"So for years I simply wasn't strong enough to cut my own toenails. My mom used to do them for me, and she'd make comments about how anxious I got and made jokes about accidentally cutting my toes off or cutting into my skin if I didn't stop squirming. 

My grandma has cut them before and asked me why I got so nervous when she was doing them and I couldn't explain why. I would just start shaking and sweating badly.

It doesn't help that now that I'm strong enough to even cut my nails, instead of getting congratulated for it after never being able to do so on my own, my grandma berated me a few weeks ago about how my nails were long. I told her that I had cut them myself a week or so before and she didn't bat an eye. I had to loudly say ""no"" to her sitting in front of me, about to grab the clippers and cut my nails even though I told her I didn't want her to. That's when I told her I had cut them myself, and she said to cut my nails in front of her then so she could see it. I said no again and she sighed and rolled her eyes like a whiny little bitch and got up and left. I'm an adult, I'll cut my nails when I feel like I need to.

Well I needed to tonight because one of my nails started digging into the skin a little. I noticed as I was cutting them I was shaking a little and sweating like mad, and it was making it hard to grip the clippers which just made me more nervous since I'm so inexperienced using them and am terrified of accidentally pinching/cutting myself.

I was exposed to covid on April 21st from my massage therapist. I found out on the 24th and I went to get tested immediately even tho I know it was to quick. The result game back negative the next day, I was relieved for a second but my anxiety knew this was just the beginning. I waited till the ideal time to go get tested which I was told between them, I went again to get tested on the 29th of April, got the test back next day and it was negative. My anxiety still did not settle and continue to persist, all of her other clients she saw that day, 4 total, have all been retested and have tested negative as well. Throughout this entire time since I found out I was exposed my anxiety has been through the roof, I check my temperature at least 40 times a day. I have been constantly fatigued and feel drained over stressing my body over this, I have been so eagled eye over every sensation my body feels and it’s terrible. I didn’t feel satisfied with two negative PCR tests, so I put myself at risk again and went to get tested on May 2nd, 11 days since my exposure, I received the test again next day and I tested negative once again, I woke up the next morning feeling somewhat relieved but still very anxious that I could still have the virus, as the day passed I keep going on this thread and scaring myself even more and I started to feel dizzy and lightheaded as the day went on, I had a very dry irritated sinus like in between my throat and my nose as it was raining a lot my anxiety was like your having a sore throat it’s the first sign, but it has not been feeling like that at all today. I have not been drinking nearly enough water and I have recognized that. Today I was shaking in bed thinking I have covid, I felt the same way fatigued and just drained by putting my body through hell stressing over this. I was a very heavy weed smoker but as I was exposed I went cold turkey completely. I coughed up black and yellow tinted phlegm which made my anxiety completely spiral. Today I have been feeling generally fine, but I have had pins and needles in my hands which have worried me, I cracked my lower back for the first time in a while today and it didn’t hurt at first but now my lower back is in a lot of pain and I’m worried that this could be the start of covid body aches even tho, it’s my two weeks since I’ve been exposed tomorrow, my lower legs have felt aches today but they last very brief for 10-30 seconds, and I’ve had ice pick headaches again very brief throughout the day, but I just have this overall feeling of dizziness and I just feel like I don’t wanna do anything and I simply can’t. 

I live at home with my parents and I’m so afraid to give them the virus as they are older and at risk. I have been doing my best to distance and wear a mask throughout the two weeks but I have slipped up at times. 

The reason why I’m posting this is as I am unsure what I should do, tomorrow is officially 14 days since my exposure and have had 3 negative results to show for it. I want to get one more test done to just ease my mind one final time, but I am so worried about putting myself more at risk to go get tested again. How rare would it be to have 3 negative tests that spread out, I am beyond worried I could still have it and not know and potentially kill my parents or I could die from the virus myself. 

Can someone please offer me some peace of mind as I am unsure if this is anxiety or I could be at the start of my symptom onset, I am having a panic attack at the moment!!

,Anxiety,"Some slight trigger warning about getting harrassed/followed/scary situation.

The other night I was walking home on my usual route from work. I got off my usual stop. I don't wear flashy clothes, I walk fast and I mind my own business. I was the only one who left the train and another guy also got off. He opened the door for me. I just said thanks. I didn't really think about it so much so I just started walking to my usual route but for some reason I had an odd feeling about this guy; he was of mid-age, strange looking, and plus he was taking the same path as me. Nobody else was outside. I dismissed those thoughts, thinking I was just being judgmental, paranoid and watched too many horror films.

The path to my home is dark, not much streetlights and forests surrounding majority of the area. Nobody was outside that night and there weren't any cars passing by. He eventually picked up his walking pace and passed me. I felt extremely relieved, mentally beating myself up for being so paranoid over nothing.

Suddenly he turned around and stopped walking. He just... stood there. It seemed like... he was waiting for something? I walked faster, then he shouted something I didn't understand. I was REALLY confused. He suddenly grabbed my arm and started talking about satan and wanting to kill me or whatever? It was really hard to understand since his speech was incoherent. He was possibly drunk/high off amphetamines or whatever. I slapped his hand away from his grip and semi-jogged, eventually ran, and then he started running after me too. I was like, fuck, I AM in a horror movie. He also had a backpack on and he was carrying either a knife or a broken bottle. It was really hard to tell because it was pitch black outside and I didn't really look at him so much because I was frightened.

I didn't think about calling 112 while running because I was thinking he would just grab my phone and throw it away, making it useless. I was so terrified to the point where the only logical thing to do was to run.

Luckily a restaurant nearby was open and I went inside and he followed me in. For some reason, I tried to downplay it and acted casual so I wouldn't freak the cashier out and attempted to order something, at this point I was already shitting my pants. I really don't know why I pretended to act normal. I guess I froze up and I wanted to see if the situation would further escalate if there are witnesses and I was right: he wouldn't stop touching my arm/shoulder and he was basically hovering over my back. The cashier looked confused and I finally told the cashier to call the police. The guy suddenly got scared and threatened us because he didn't want the police to come. I guess he panicked, went outside, stared at us with the MEANEST look ever and eventually left.

It's only been a day but I'm extremely shaken up by what happened. I had so much anxiety when I was walking home today to the point where I felt like throwing up. How can I walk alone at night without being so damn anxious? I would greatly appreciate any advice. Oh, and I can't buy pepper spray here, you need to have a license for it (eg. police officers).

,Anxiety,"So i am 25f and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 10 years! We have had our good times and bad times, but we’ve always stuck it out and came out stronger together. I must admit that about 2 times in the past, we almost broke up and it absolutely destroyed me. I would feel like he was pulling away from me and he would deny it and say we were good, but then it would just build up and he would finally admit something was wrong and we would be at a really low point and on the verge of a breakup. Although we never actually broke up, these times absolutely destroyed me and i don’t know how i got through them. For both times this happened, we put in the hard work to get back on track and eventually things got patched up, and actually they became better than ever before and we would be so happy we stayed.

Now let’s go to the present. I can’t seem to shake the anxiety that something is wrong or that he will break up with me. I have always been like this since the first time we almost split, but lately it has been unbearable and all consuming. For some background, i recently went through a health scare and although i am fine now, it took a much larger toll on me than i would like to admit. I also was put on medication to manage my thyroid levels, and i definitely feel like that has to have a huge impact on my rise in anxiety lately. 

Back to the main saga! I can’t stop worrying if we are good or not. I have brought it up and he says we are good, but i feel like i worry since in the past he would say we were good and then it would turn out we weren’t. I just want to keep talking about it over and over and over and get all the reassurance i can. He hates these kinds of conversations, and most of the time i just get a short response like “yes we are absolutely good, thank you for checking up but you don’t have to worry” and my anxious mind translates this into “short reply? Must be bad!” since i’m over here writing paragraphs about my feelings.

I over analyze everything. We went to dinner the other day and the car ride was kinda quiet, so my mind is already thinking “he has nothing to say to you, he isn’t interested anymore, you’re boring to him after 10 years” etc. It’s like i make myself miserable over literally anything, and then i feel more anxiety/pressure to try to make myself seem bubbly and fun and full of conversation in hopes of looking more interesting. We were intimate the other night and i was feeling kind of fat, so i went into that with 0 confidence and could not shake the thought of how bad i looked and he probably isn’t as attracted to me. Not to be TMI, but i would be uh, touching him, and i was literally thinking “he’s going to get soft any second because he doesn’t like you anymore.” Like it’s getting so out of hand.

It’s also at a point where i’m so worried about the future. We are supposed to buy a place together in the summer and all i keep thinking is that he doesn’t really want to and any day now he’ll tell me. Or that maybe he will but it’s just because he feels bad for me. And then i also come up with all these backup plans in my head if he does leave me, like how i would just completely move away to another state if we broke up, etc, to feel like i have something going for me i guess or to get away from it all as a distraction. I play scenarios in my head of him breaking up with me to almost prepare myself for how it will feel too. I’m driving myself crazy.

I don’t know what to do here. It’s really out of hand and i don’t know what to do. I try to talk to him about it, but he assures me nothing is wrong, and my anxious brain just over thinks what he says anyway. I know it has to get annoying constantly being asked if things are good, so i am trying not to spam him 24/7 with questioning. I try to be positive and tell myself that this man makes time for me and does things to make me laugh, etc and that it is all in my head, but i can’t stop. How do i stop? Why am i doing this to myself? Has anyone ever dealt with this? I would take any advice :( i know therapy will be suggested, but i really don’t know if i have the time at the moment as awful as that sounds.

I play scenarios in my head of him breaking up with me to almost prepare myself for how it will feel too. I’m driving myself crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do here. It’s really out of hand and i don’t know what to do. I try to talk to him about it, but he assures me nothing is wrong, and my anxious brain just over thinks what he says anyway. I know it has to get annoying constantly being asked if things are good, so i am trying not to spam him 24/7 with questioning. I try to be positive and tell myself that this man makes time for me and does things to make me laugh, etc and that it is all in my head, but i can’t stop. How do i stop? Why am i doing this to myself? Has anyone ever dealt with this? I would take any advice :( i know therapy will be suggested, but i really don’t know if i have the time at the moment as awful as that sounds. I am highly considering it, but if anyone has advice for the meantime i would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I find myself crippled with anxiety. I have had anxiety my entire life and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia and panic disorder. I function well on a daily basis because I’ve been working from home for several years. That has helped tremendously.

I do not take any medication daily, but take a benzo if anxiety is bothering me. I am dealing with the stress of buying a house which has left me crippled with anxiety and also I have anxiety coming from my brother and his wife since his wife (more the wife talking through him) and her family are extremely demanding and they’re having a child and are claiming we “don’t seem that excited” which is absurd. So I’ve got these two things going on at the same time along with their baby shower coming up which my mom is making me feel like I should go because it will hurt his feelings if I don’t. It coincides with our closing date so I think I can get out of going and dealing with nasty relatives on top of his wife and her family’s overbearing and controlling nature. 

Then there’s the house stuff- we haven’t told our families yet and my family and his family is fine. Just his dad and step mom are a bit much. I just am so anxious about all the house stuff, and the sellers still haven’t gotten something needed yet. 

I have taken my prescription (clonazipam- I think it’s only .25mg so very small, otherwise I get tired but I can take .5mg as well) and it almost always works for anxiety moments but it’s not helping me at all with the above. I find myself unable to function sometimes but I’m powering through. I just shut down when it’s too much and I really have to be on top of the house stuff and have been. I am very close to shutting down though because with a house so many things absolutely must be done by a certain date, and I’m ready but we also have to worry about the sellers being on top of things. 

Thank you for listening. Have you ever not gone to a big family event like a baby shower? I even have anxiety about dealing with not going if any feelings are hurt. I don’t even know that I will have time. And there’s also toxic family on my own side of the family and my brothers wife’s.

,Anxiety,"I've had panic attacks for about 15 years. I've tried a variety of medications and therapy. When I talked about my anxiety I would always say **""I'm not really an anxious person, these attacks just come out of nowhere.""** 

Recently I started reading a workbook recommended on this sub called ""Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic"" -- I started it, because my panic attacks have gotten much worse since COVID and my agoraphobia has worsened (I fear leaving the house and being in loud/noisy/trapped places, primarily driving and going to malls or stores). 

In reading this book I've realized that anxiety and panic are different (big duh I guess) and that while the panic attacks cause me the most pain, I definitely **do** have anxiety, and they are linked. 

Things I didn't realize meant I was anxious: always getting places an hour early, drowning myself in work and loving how I feel when I'm busy, creating to-do lists all the time, constantly thinking about a million things at once, worrying about things that may never happen constantly, worrying incessantly about how people perceive me, a persistent lingering thought about dying. A lot of these traits helped me be good at life. I'm known to be a good friend (I always remember to send birthday cards) and I'm punctual and hyper-organized (so I thrive at work).

But those obsessive thoughts about being early, preparing for every eventuality, always detailing every detail of a trip, google mapping everywhere (even places I know well)... it made me realize that my body holds this TENSION. I am ALWAYS tense. I realized it's not necessarily ""normal"" to always be TENSE. And the tension I feel and the anxiety about the future was generating the perfect conditions for me to experience panic. 

I'm about 1/3 of the way through this workbook but today I drove my car and went into two stores. I used to do these things pre-COVID with no issue (for the most part). Some parts of my anxiety are already a part of my personality (I still think showing up gently early to places is polite) but I'm going to try and teach myself to just let go a little bit.

He also said that sometimes when someone has something traumatic happen in childhood, the amygdala becomes &amp;#39;broken&amp;#39; as such and that&amp;#39;s why in adulthood it&amp;#39;s all over the place, suddenly basically making you feel like the world is ending while you&amp;#39;re just sitting chilling having a nice time. It helped me to learn exactly what was causing as it showed me the fear was not based on anything real, my brain was just getting mixed up. I tell you this in case it helps any of you too and please share what&amp;#39;s helped you :)&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"In March 2020, I wrote a post about how I confessed to tone policing others on Twitter during the start of the 2020 anxiety. I did this by talking about how 2020 wasn't all that bad and how things are going well for me. I was rude, selfish, and I vented in an inappropriate way to these people of which there is no excuse. The point of my post was that this wasn't the person who I wanted to be and made a vow to change my behavior once another Twitter user called me out on my actions which were uncalled for.

I was feeling terrible guilt for my actions at the time of me writing that post. And what did you do? You trashed me for my actions, painted me as a psychopath who had no remorse for what I did, and told me to ""keep punching down. It's a real good look.""

I replied to you in the best manner I could. Telling you that you missed the part where I said I felt bad about my actions and skimmed over the part where I apologized for my actions. I told you that I was so sorry for hurting you. This was not the person I wanted to be and I made that point clear in my post.

You responded by saying you read those parts (if you did, you would not have said the things you just said) and took certain paragraphs from my post out of context or were written while I was in the heat of the moment. I made a point in my first comment to you that I made a vow to stop doing this inexcusable behavior. And what did you say? You claimed that I was expecting praise for something I ""never said"".

 I politely said to you that you were breaking rule #1 which is that we don't ever insult, invalidate, or antagonize the OP. In your next comment, you continue to break rule #1 even after I called you out and reported you for it. This is ironic considering that you frequently did the same to other Reddit users even though you aren't even a moderator. In response, you called me out for another rule I didn't even break. You accused me of sh\_tposting on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/). I WROTE THAT POST IN COMPLETE SHAME AND GUILT FOR MY ACTIONS AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF SHTPOSTING! By that logic, everything on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/) is a sh\_tpost! 

I replied to a different user on the same post who was actually really kind and understanding. I wrote to them about all the good things that happened to me in 2020. I noticed you greatly toned down your hostility and appeared conversational. I wanted to keep that up so I made a friendly comment to you but you wrote back ""You're free to leave whenever you want."" No! You leave! I'm the OP after all! Okay, I didn't say that last part, but I made some cute little comment about leaving that I cringe looking back on.

Looking back, I was too nice to you. I should have been more direct and dominant. I reported you for every comment on my post yet you didn't get banned. I wrote about this a year ago on this sub. But because I mentioned the specific post and revealed your username, I got permabanned on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/) when it should have been you.

The only person I really talked to was an 18 year old man who was constantly talking to me and getting a little to close to me.

The next day we saw each other we had class together and he sat behind me. He then proceeded to put his foot on my butt for the entirety of class later that day I told him I did not want to date him. So whenever a guy gets near me I’m in that set of mind that they will do something. The about a month ago a friend messaged me saying he liked me that night we went to watch a movie together we “cuddle” for not that long. But then he was constantly texting me and if I didn’t respond right away he would think something is wrong. Then the 3rd night he said I love you.

,Anxiety,"I've got a LOT on my plate these days. Check my post history if you want all the details, but my main issue I'm dealing with is this fear of being alone. 

I wake up earlier than I'd like with the anxiety, I start to journal and cry - I usually post on some support sites on reddit (a bit compulsively). I'll cry and do this as long as I can - without a deadline it'll last about 2 hours and I'll feel pretty exhausted, my body will hurt from being so tense. 

It's kind of the only thing that makes the fear seem manageable - posting on reddit and getting feedback.

In one way it's awful because I feel like I'm drowning but in another, I know this is something I need to work on.

I find it so difficult to sit and meditate when I feel this way. I have to limit going on walks because I have some minor mobility issues that I need to do light exercises for - REALLY difficult to do the exercises when I'm feeling panicked. I just...panic. I worry.

I cried and journaled, I met with a potential new roommate (my old one/bestie is leaving), did some errands for work, found my way back home because I wanted to cry more. Now I'm back to journaling via reddit.

This day. I have a day to fill. It's not even empty but I'm not excited about my plans. What I want is to be around the two people in my life who support me emotionally. One is my roomie, but she's needing space and that's why she's moving out. The other is my sister but she's needing space today. I have a lot of painful things in my life right now - grief over my dad's death, grief over my dog's death, facing the burden of childhood stuff, now grief over my roommate leaving, uncertainty in who I'll live with (terrified to live alone). 

So I'm not going to be supported emotionally by my friends today and that's probably something I need to avoid doing because it's part of why I'm such a wreck today. Being alone didn't used to be like this until I outsourced my emotional regulation. I have my therapist who'll help but the session will go by so quickly and I just...I'm so scared. 

I clearly neglect myself when I'm under stress - I push off eating, I push off maintaining my body, I don't think I've had a sip of water all day. The reason? I just keep thinking ""I'll sort through this feeling first and then..."" It's hard to eat through the panic. 

When I'm around people I can do these things better - which is part of why I don't want to live alone. I don't know how to cope with these feelings. I wake up and in my mind I'm begging my roommate not to leave but she's leaving. Honestly the thought of getting up and going to the kitchen to make some food and eating it alone is so sad to me. Even being in this house is so depressing. These feelings are so big. 

I'll be perfectly honest - I don't think I'm cut out for this. 

In my mind I'm just screaming ""God, please help me"" and I'm not even religious. I'm just so overwhelmed by this loneliness and this fear, I don't feel like I can survive it. Please help me. Please, please help me. I know I have to be strong to survive this, I know it has to come from me. 

Nobody is coming to help me....what can I do? What can I do to survive this? I can't depend on the people I used to depend on and I feel like I'm falling off a cliff.

I have a lot of painful things in my life right now - grief over my dad&amp;#39;s death, grief over my dog&amp;#39;s death, facing the burden of childhood stuff, now grief over my roommate leaving, uncertainty in who I&amp;#39;ll live with (terrified to live alone). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m not going to be supported emotionally by my friends today and that&amp;#39;s probably something I need to avoid doing because it&amp;#39;s part of why I&amp;#39;m such a wreck today. Being alone didn&amp;#39;t used to be like this until I outsourced my emotional regulation. I have my therapist who&amp;#39;ll help but the session will go by so quickly and I just...I&amp;#39;m so scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clearly neglect myself when I&amp;#39;m under stress - I push off eating, I push off maintaining my body, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve had a sip of water all day. The reason? I just keep thinking &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll sort through this feeling first and then...&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s hard to eat through the panic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m around people I can do these things better - which is part of why I don&amp;#39;t want to live alone. I don&amp;#39;t know how to cope with these feelings. I wake up and in my mind I&amp;#39;m begging my roommate not to leave but she&amp;#39;s leaving. Honestly the thought of getting up and going to the kitchen to make some food and eating it alone is so sad to me. Even being in this house is so depressing. These feelings are so big. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be perfectly honest - I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m cut out for this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind I&amp;#39;m just screaming &amp;quot;God, please help me&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m not even religious. I&amp;#39;m just so overwhelmed by this loneliness and this fear, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I can survive it. Please help me. Please, please help me. I know I have to be strong to survive this, I know it has to come from me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody is coming to help me....what can I do? What can I do to survive this? I can&amp;#39;t depend on the people I used to depend on and I feel like I&amp;#39;m falling off a cliff. I felt this way before when my dog died but I had people then. NOW - WHAT DO I HAVE.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I'm just sad. Suicidal ideation is very real some days. 

My medications have been a pain in the ass, almost always worsening my mental state even after 2 years and many medications. 

I'm wasting my life away at a desk job in the prime of my life and it hurts. I don't even like my job. But I need the income and I wouldn't even know what kind of other job to seek out. I like the company I work for and the people are wonderful. Not many jobs are like that, I realize. But 8 hours a day at a desk is torture to me. It is the EXACT situation I feared getting into since college. And here I am...I've fallen right into the very nightmare I used to fear. And I have no way out. Anxiety makes it impossible on top of everything else. 

I'm watching friends and family proceed with lives. Having children and families, going to school for their passions, succeeding in other areas while I sit and watch it all go by from a cubicle...

I've never wanted children, but watching my dear friends go through the process and finding their purpose in being parents and pleasing their own parents with giving them grand children and following a normal life path makes me feel so inadequate and like such a disappointment to my own family. 

Or on the contrary, my friends want to commit suicide and there is nothing I can ever say or do to help them and it makes me feel like a failure, and terrified for them.

I did go to college for a degree I liked, but there's nothing I can really do with it and beyond that I don't want a master's degree so I can't really further myself in that area. I also have no passions to pursue. 

I have to watch friends go through some other things, LGBT things, finding pride in themselves and loving themselves while I cannot work through my own LGBT issues. It hurts a lot to watch them find happiness with themselves when I can't. It's another reminder that I am just a fuck up in life and going nowhere. 

My therapist just went on indefinite leave and I no longer have therapy, but after 2 years, I don't think it was helping me anyway. I've read the self-help books and tried to address my issues but I just can't. 

My life is a waste and I have no purpose in this world. I don't look forward to anything. Every day is a trudging journey to a grave, maybe even an early one. 

My home is a mess with dishes piled up endlessly in my sink, I'm a disgrace and a piss poor role model for my sibling, I only shower maybe once a week, I don't fold or hang laundry and it's piled up and strewn everywhere in my home. I have boxes just laying around everywhere. I have no motivation to improve my work status anymore, and I don't hit the gym or workout like I used to. My eating habits are messed up with an eating disorder that might slowly be killing me, which is okay with me at this point. 

Anxiety keeps me from moving forward with so many things. I can't get past so much. I constantly wonder what the root cause of my sadness is and can never dig it up so I feel like I can't and shouldn't do anything until I find it. And if I never find it, then my life will always be a waste. Meaningless, purposeless, failed. 

Ultimately, I don't want to be alive anymore.

Suicidal ideation is very real some days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My medications have been a pain in the ass, almost always worsening my mental state even after 2 years and many medications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wasting my life away at a desk job in the prime of my life and it hurts. I don&amp;#39;t even like my job. But I need the income and I wouldn&amp;#39;t even know what kind of other job to seek out. I like the company I work for and the people are wonderful. Not many jobs are like that, I realize. But 8 hours a day at a desk is torture to me. It is the EXACT situation I feared getting into since college. And here I am...I&amp;#39;ve fallen right into the very nightmare I used to fear. And I have no way out. Anxiety makes it impossible on top of everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m watching friends and family proceed with lives. Having children and families, going to school for their passions, succeeding in other areas while I sit and watch it all go by from a cubicle...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never wanted children, but watching my dear friends go through the process and finding their purpose in being parents and pleasing their own parents with giving them grand children and following a normal life path makes me feel so inadequate and like such a disappointment to my own family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or on the contrary, my friends want to commit suicide and there is nothing I can ever say or do to help them and it makes me feel like a failure, and terrified for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did go to college for a degree I liked, but there&amp;#39;s nothing I can really do with it and beyond that I don&amp;#39;t want a master&amp;#39;s degree so I can&amp;#39;t really further myself in that area. I also have no passions to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been a sufferer of anxiety for a while now and over the last few months I’ve been starting to feel really down. I’ve been getting extremely irritated and annoyed at even the slightest things, and I feel like a lot of it is due to lockdown. A few of the things that have happened to me recently are:

* I had my first PhD paper (very harshly and unjustifiably) rejected after being under review since last September 

* I got rejected following a job interview (been applying to get a job for when I finish my PhD)

* The other day I bumped my car on a rock that was in my blind spot and scraped it - minor thing but still annoying

* 2 of my housemates have “got together” - this only winds me up because I’ve been with my gf for 6 years now and still only get to see her at weekends and at a distance due to lockdown/Covid, yet my housemates seem to rub the fact they’ve got each-other in my face. I am happy for 1 of my housemates in this, because he’s been rejected a lot before - but the other basically doesn’t give me the time of day now they’re together

* The fact I don’t live with my girlfriend yet (due to Covid and my study commitments here)

,Anxiety,"My journey began when I was about 17 years old. I had always been a very anxious person, but nothing major and it certainly didn’t have a big impact in my life. I remember having a few episodes when I was younger where I would experience anxiety, but really nothing too big. My mom has always been an anxious person, so I think this kind of stuck with me a bit too. Back to me as a 17-year-old. At that time, I remember being a happy person and kind of “careless” in a way that, I didn’t think too much about life or consequences. You could call me selfish, careless and I didn’t really understand what it meant to feel bad or experience depression in a way. At this time, I started to experience anxiety in small waves. I don’t what triggered it, but it came in form of these obsessive thoughts. It could be thoughts about my sexuality, me hurting someone physically and just the thought of that created an anxious feeling in my body and mind. I didn’t really know what to do since I wasn’t familiar with this, and I didn’t really want share anything to anybody. For 1 year I kept in silence and I just kept experiencing these obsessive thoughts which caused a lot of anxiety in my body and mind. I felt so bad for myself since I was so young, and my friends were just doing so good both in school and mentally. I’m sure they had their problems, but I could just see them living their life while mine was slowly falling apart.

One day when I was about 18 years old my whole mind collapsed. I was with my girlfriend and all these obsessive thoughts just kept coming and creating so much anxiety in my mind, that I felt my head would blow up. I went to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror. I saw myself so scared and anxious, so I began to cry so much which kind of helped because I just felt something releasing from my body and mind. This is where my *nervous breakdown* began. I had no clue what to do and I couldn’t talk to my parents about this. They would never understand what I was going through. My girlfriend tried to help me and talk to me, but what was she going to do about it? She didn’t know anything about the anxiety I experienced so I didn’t blame her for not understanding.

At 18 I decided to contact a mental institution for teens. I got to talk to a psychiatrist which very quickly tried to offer me meds, so that my mind would calm, and we could work through it. I remember considering this, but I said no. I wanted to know what happened to me and why did this feeling choose me? I went to see my psychiatrist for about 2 years, 2 times a month. She didn’t really understand what was going on and most of our conversations were about my life and dreams. These meetings I had with her simply kept the anxiety a bit distanced, since I got to release some of my thoughts and fears. I still didn’t understand why it was happening to me and neither did my psychiatrist. 2 years went by and I kind of didn’t see any point in seeing her anymore, so I decided it was time to stop. The day I left; I had this empty feeling in my body. Remember, I was going there for 2 years to talk about a problem that had a huge impact in my life, but nobody understood me. My friends didn’t understand me, my teachers, family... Nobody.

My social life was okay, I guess. I had a few friends at that time and my girlfriend, but it just didn’t work out. I moved together with my girlfriend and the anxiety was just too much for me and her. I could feel that she really didn’t understand what was going on and why I kept crying every night for several years. Eventually I decided to leave her because I could see this wasn’t going to end well. I felt so bad inside, but I still somehow managed to live and ordinary life. I went to the local gym, tried to start school again, but I just had these periods of anxiety which always ended up ruining it for me. You may think, what kind of anxiety did I experience these years?EVERYTHING. Anything you can imagine. Obsessive thoughts, panic attack, depersonalization, general anxiety. All these symptoms combined into one negative spiral of anxiety. This can be hard to understand if you haven’t experienced it yourself, but it’s like being trapped in a nightmare.

This was meant to be the time of my life. Young and fearless, living life and dreaming big. My anxiety ruined it all for me. I couldn’t concentrate in school, I couldn’t keep a job, I just couldn’t keep anything for too long. I felt like this would be my life forever. When I turned 22, I tried contacting a psychologist. She tried to put the blame on my parents and my childhood. I never had a problem with my childhood though. Sure, my parents weren’t the wealthiest and we went through some hard times, but I remember having a great childhood. None of this made sense for me at the time, and it sure doesn’t to this day. I know, she tried the best, but I was still suffering so bad every single day and I wanted to feel good again. I tried everything. Contacting psychiatrists, psychologist, and all those quick-fix anxiety methods you could find.

At this point I just turned 23 years old. I was tired of my life and how anxiety was controlling my whole life in every aspect. I was tired of all the anxiety going through my mind all day long, from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. I had been searching a lot online at this time and I saw like anyone else, so many horrifying stories about people never being free of anxiety and suffering till the end. This was my biggest fear at that time. The fear of never being free and feeling like my old self again. I was addicted to reading stories on the internet and I always kept the success stories next to me just in case I felt bad. I still wanted my anxiety to disappear forever and be free quickly, but I slowly started reading about anxiety in a different way than I used to. I began searching about what caused anxiety to humans. It could be the outcome of stress, depression, and other things in your life that you didn’t take care of. I began to understand the cycle I got trapped in, back when I was 17. The obsessive thoughts I experienced at that time frightened me so much that I would distract myself every time I had them. I gave these thoughts so much power over me, and they just came back stronger and harder every single day. You can’t distract yourself forever trust me. I was creating so much anxiety in my mind and body by distracting myself, but I didn’t understand it at the time. I came across a person that probably suffered way more than I did. His name was Paul David. I remember first seeing his website where people would talk about their experiences and share success stories. At this point, I felt that there was hope out there. I quickly purchased his book *at last a life*, and I started reading and reading. Something in this book made sense for me in some way, and I tried to inhale all the information I could get from it. I had found a book that finally understood how I was feeling. My anxiety was still there at full blast, but I had finally found a man that went through the same journey as I was going through. This was the biggest relief I had ever experienced in my whole life. I can’t even explain to you how I felt at the moment.

At this time, I began to understand how anxiety works, but it wasn’t without many mistakes and errors. I still wanted my anxiety to be gone, but not in the same way as before. My main goal was to get out and experience as much anxiety as I could. I would have days where I gave up and stayed at home and other days where I felt like I conquered the world. This was all a part of my recovering process. It was filled with doubt, mistakes, and a lot of trying and crying. I began to understand that a lot of these feelings that I had in my body were just harmless feelings. I had been giving them so much attention and that’s why they controlled my life. Anxiety isn’t anything but at feeling. Of course, I felt bad at the time, but I had to go outside and get my life back. Was I going to let a feeling keep me from that? Definitely not.Going through this recovering phase was necessary for me. I experienced my depersonalization at the worst in some situations, but I would just try to let it pass and not bother freaking out. When you begin to recover from anxiety, you’ll see that you will have these “aha” moments. If I must give an explanation to this, it feels like you see through the anxiety. When I would let my anxiety pass instead of freaking out, I would get this feeling of “aha”, was that just it? It was just a feeling that I was hiding from. I had been hiding from anxiety for a long time so I knew that this process would take time. I didn’t set time on recovery because it would be counterproductive. My recovery wasn’t about getting rid of these terrible feelings of anxiety. My recovery was about FEELING my anxiety. I began putting Paul David’s book into practice and my understanding just grew time by time. As time went by anxiety just became to mean less and less to me. I began to stop reading about anxiety slowly, not worrying so much and I slowly stopped making everything about anxiety. I used to read about anxiety daily and constantly fill my mind with anxious information. Knowledge is the key to recovering and when you begin to understand anxiety, all of this will make sense to you, trust me. I don’t know why I decided to write a story about my life and my experiences with it. Maybe because it used to be my life. I’m 26 years old now and I wouldn’t trade my years with anxiety for anything in the world. This taught me so much about life and so much about myself. I just want to make it out to some people and tell them that there is hope and that you can recover.

I had always been a very anxious person, but nothing major and it certainly didn’t have a big impact in my life. I remember having a few episodes when I was younger where I would experience anxiety, but really nothing too big. My mom has always been an anxious person, so I think this kind of stuck with me a bit too. Back to me as a 17-year-old. At that time, I remember being a happy person and kind of “careless” in a way that, I didn’t think too much about life or consequences. You could call me selfish, careless and I didn’t really understand what it meant to feel bad or experience depression in a way. At this time, I started to experience anxiety in small waves. I don’t what triggered it, but it came in form of these obsessive thoughts. It could be thoughts about my sexuality, me hurting someone physically and just the thought of that created an anxious feeling in my body and mind. I didn’t really know what to do since I wasn’t familiar with this, and I didn’t really want share anything to anybody. For 1 year I kept in silence and I just kept experiencing these obsessive thoughts which caused a lot of anxiety in my body and mind. I felt so bad for myself since I was so young, and my friends were just doing so good both in school and mentally. I’m sure they had their problems, but I could just see them living their life while mine was slowly falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day when I was about 18 years old my whole mind collapsed. I was with my girlfriend and all these obsessive thoughts just kept coming and creating so much anxiety in my mind, that I felt my head would blow up. I went to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror. I saw myself so scared and anxious, so I began to cry so much which kind of helped because I just felt something releasing from my body and mind. This is where my &lt;em&gt;nervous breakdown&lt;/em&gt; began. I had no clue what to do and I couldn’t talk to my parents about this. They would never understand what I was going through. My girlfriend tried to help me and talk to me, but what was she going to do about it? She didn’t know anything about the anxiety I experienced so I didn’t blame her for not understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 18 I decided to contact a mental institution for teens. I got to talk to a psychiatrist which very quickly tried to offer me meds, so that my mind would calm, and we could work through it. I remember considering this, but I said no. I wanted to know what happened to me and why did this feeling choose me? I went to see my psychiatrist for about 2 years, 2 times a month. She didn’t really understand what was going on and most of our conversations were about my life and dreams. These meetings I had with her simply kept the anxiety a bit distanced, since I got to release some of my thoughts and fears. I still didn’t understand why it was happening to me and neither did my psychiatrist. 2 years went by and I kind of didn’t see any point in seeing her anymore, so I decided it was time to stop. The day I left; I had this empty feeling in my body. Remember, I was going there for 2 years to talk about a problem that had a huge impact in my life, but nobody understood me. My friends didn’t understand me, my teachers, family... Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My social life was okay, I guess. I had a few friends at that time and my girlfriend, but it just didn’t work out. I moved together with my girlfriend and the anxiety was just too much for me and her. I could feel that she really didn’t understand what was going on and why I kept crying every night for several years. Eventually I decided to leave her because I could see this wasn’t going to end well. I felt so bad inside, but I still somehow managed to live and ordinary life. I went to the local gym, tried to start school again, but I just had these periods of anxiety which always ended up ruining it for me. You may think, what kind of anxiety did I experience these years?EVERYTHING. Anything you can imagine. Obsessive thoughts, panic attack, depersonalization, general anxiety. All these symptoms combined into one negative spiral of anxiety. This can be hard to understand if you haven’t experienced it yourself, but it’s like being trapped in a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was meant to be the time of my life. Young and fearless, living life and dreaming big. My anxiety ruined it all for me. I couldn’t concentrate in school, I couldn’t keep a job, I just couldn’t keep anything for too long. I felt like this would be my life forever. When I turned 22, I tried contacting a psychologist. She tried to put the blame on my parents and my childhood. I never had a problem with my childhood though. Sure, my parents weren’t the wealthiest and we went through some hard times, but I remember having a great childhood. None of this made sense for me at the time, and it sure doesn’t to this day. I know, she tried the best, but I was still suffering so bad every single day and I wanted to feel good again. I tried everything. Contacting psychiatrists, psychologist, and all those quick-fix anxiety methods you could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I just turned 23 years old. I was tired of my life and how anxiety was controlling my whole life in every aspect. I was tired of all the anxiety going through my mind all day long, from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. I had been searching a lot online at this time and I saw like anyone else, so many horrifying stories about people never being free of anxiety and suffering till the end. This was my biggest fear at that time. The fear of never being free and feeling like my old self again. I was addicted to reading stories on the internet and I always kept the success stories next to me just in case I felt bad. I still wanted my anxiety to disappear forever and be free quickly, but I slowly started reading about anxiety in a different way than I used to. I began searching about what caused anxiety to humans. It could be the outcome of stress, depression, and other things in your life that you didn’t take care of. I began to understand the cycle I got trapped in, back when I was 17. The obsessive thoughts I experienced at that time frightened me so much that I would distract myself every time I had them. I gave these thoughts so much power over me, and they just came back stronger and harder every single day. You can’t distract yourself forever trust me. I was creating so much anxiety in my mind and body by distracting myself, but I didn’t understand it at the time. I came across a person that probably suffered way more than I did. His name was Paul David. I remember first seeing his website where people would talk about their experiences and share success stories. At this point, I felt that there was hope out there. I quickly purchased his book &lt;em&gt;at last a life&lt;/em&gt;, and I started reading and reading. Something in this book made sense for me in some way, and I tried to inhale all the information I could get from it. I had found a book that finally understood how I was feeling. My anxiety was still there at full blast, but I had finally found a man that went through the same journey as I was going through. This was the biggest relief I had ever experienced in my whole life. I can’t even explain to you how I felt at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, I began to understand how anxiety works, but it wasn’t without many mistakes and errors. I still wanted my anxiety to be gone, but not in the same way as before. My main goal was to get out and experience as much anxiety as I could. I would have days where I gave up and stayed at home and other days where I felt like I conquered the world. This was all a part of my recovering process. It was filled with doubt, mistakes, and a lot of trying and crying. I began to understand that a lot of these feelings that I had in my body were just harmless feelings. I had been giving them so much attention and that’s why they controlled my life. Anxiety isn’t anything but at feeling. Of course, I felt bad at the time, but I had to go outside and get my life back. Was I going to let a feeling keep me from that?

,Anxiety,"I have had pretty awful anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD as a teenager, and have been in and out of treatment ever since, struggling with intermittent depression. I am 27 now and just feel so lost. Went back to therapy this year just to feel like I was at least trying to get my mental health under control, but even with all of the coping mechanisms I have learned, I can't seem to break out of this awful feeling. I keep thinking I'm doing a little better, but each time my anxiety ""flares up"" again, it feels worse than the last. I'm in a really awful place right now, probably because I just found out my 5 year old cat has a heart murmur and I need to take her to have a echocardiogram. I am terrified they are going to find something seriously wrong with her. If that happens, I don't know how I will be able to handle it emotionally. I haven't been able to stop crying since I found out.

Last time I felt this bad, I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital. I hoped I would finally get the help I needed, but the experience was very unhelpful, and probably just caused me even more stress and confusion than anything. I have had a lot of bad experiences with various psych meds, and recently found out it may be due to the fact that I have a seizure disorder. Still gave Cymbalta a shot a couple weeks ago, but the migraines I had (which is how I was diagnosed with epilepsy - lamictal made them go away entirely) came back and I couldn't keep food down, so I had to stop it. I feel like I'm just out of options at this point. I really hoped I would never be at a point this low again, but here I am. I'm desperate to try something, but am struggling to find either a psychiatrist of psychologist who accepts my insurance.

On top of all this, I have had a lot of possible diagnoses sorta tossed at me without ever actually being diagnosed with any of them. I've had therapists suggest things like bipolar disorder. I have tried to ask people if some of the difficult things I experience are a part of my OCD or something else, but no one has any suggestions for me.

I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD as a teenager, and have been in and out of treatment ever since, struggling with intermittent depression. I am 27 now and just feel so lost. Went back to therapy this year just to feel like I was at least trying to get my mental health under control, but even with all of the coping mechanisms I have learned, I can&amp;#39;t seem to break out of this awful feeling. I keep thinking I&amp;#39;m doing a little better, but each time my anxiety &amp;quot;flares up&amp;quot; again, it feels worse than the last. I&amp;#39;m in a really awful place right now, probably because I just found out my 5 year old cat has a heart murmur and I need to take her to have a echocardiogram. I am terrified they are going to find something seriously wrong with her. If that happens, I don&amp;#39;t know how I will be able to handle it emotionally. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to stop crying since I found out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I felt this bad, I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital. I hoped I would finally get the help I needed, but the experience was very unhelpful, and probably just caused me even more stress and confusion than anything. I have had a lot of bad experiences with various psych meds, and recently found out it may be due to the fact that I have a seizure disorder. Still gave Cymbalta a shot a couple weeks ago, but the migraines I had (which is how I was diagnosed with epilepsy - lamictal made them go away entirely) came back and I couldn&amp;#39;t keep food down, so I had to stop it. I feel like I&amp;#39;m just out of options at this point. I really hoped I would never be at a point this low again, but here I am. I&amp;#39;m desperate to try something, but am struggling to find either a psychiatrist of psychologist who accepts my insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, I have had a lot of possible diagnoses sorta tossed at me without ever actually being diagnosed with any of them. I&amp;#39;ve had therapists suggest things like bipolar disorder. I have tried to ask people if some of the difficult things I experience are a part of my OCD or something else, but no one has any suggestions for me. I have been told to look into being evaluated for ASD, something my mom suspected when I was a toddler, but am struggling to find someone who will evaluate an adult for this. Keep reaching out to people and they just never get back to me. Just feel like I&amp;#39;ve hit a wall and am drowning in anxiety, slipping into paranoia.

,Anxiety,"Before y'all read my thread I just wanna say this isn't really a subreddit I've visited before; I mostly use my reddit account for memes, games, etc. so I wasn't really sure where else to post this after looking at a few different subreddits; with that said I apologize if this happens to be in an inappropriate subreddit or if I'm violating any rules here (If so feel free to take this down mods), I just need somewhere to express my feelings and I'm guessing this is a proper place to do so.

Some additional background that may be helpful: I'm 20M, currently a college student (I'm not a med or biology student), and have struggled with anxiety and depression before, but thankfully not on a large scale for several years now. I follow all COVID regulations too, and I am absolutely not anti-mask, anti-vax, and anything like that.

I'm not sure if conspiracy theories can be a trigger for some people, but in case they are I'll put that flair on this thread. If conspiracy theories are a trigger for you, please do not read my thread.

So as the title suggests, I want to get the COVID shots but I'm **really, really scared** to get it now. My viewpoint with the vaccine has evolved over the past few months and especially the past few days, and this is what each phase so far for me has been:

1. Thank God these are being rolled out for the elderly, vulnerable, and essential workers, but maybe I don't really need this; I'm healthy and active as I possibly can be during the pandemic, so I think I can just depend on herd immunity being reached. (Nov 2020 - Feb 2021)
2. Maybe I could get the shot(s) to help contribute to herd immunity. I'm not too sure right now, so I'll wait until enough of my friends, enough people that I follow on social media, and enough of the general population has had it to a point where it seems to be safe and effective for everyone. (Feb 2021 - Apr 2021)
3. My threshold for seeing if it's safe and effective among other people has now been met, and after having done about 2-3 hours of some research, it seems to be very safe and effective. I plan to have my first Pfizer shot on May 5th, and my second one May 26th (A few days ago - Yesterday)
4. I genuinely don't know what to do. I really want to get this, but I'm really scared about what some of these conspiracies say. (Today)

Allow me to break down what led me to point #4

Basically, a lot of my family right now does not fully support the COVID vaccine. They aren't anti-vax or anything like that, but they are highly skeptical of the COVID vaccine. They also do not oppose other people getting the vaccine either, as they believe it's up each individual. Right now, both my parents and my older brother and sister do not plan on getting it. On the contrary, I have a sister-in-law who is pregnant but does plan on getting the Pfizer vaccine as soon as her child is born. I also have two younger sisters that are currently ineligible for the shot, but one of them will probably get it when she becomes eligible presumably later this summer. My mom's parents have been fully vaccinated since February (even though they are more skeptical of vaccines in general), but to my knowledge nobody else in my extended family has the vaccine or is planning to get it.

I thought my parents had every right to know; I am their kid after all so I'd figured I'd let them know. The day I decided to schedule my appointment for the vaccine, I told my mom. She is not opposed to me getting it at all, although she hasn't been fully supportive either necessarily. She still does not plan on considering getting it until there are more long term studies on the vaccine, and her threshold for the amount of people who have it and are safe and ok is much higher than mine was.

The next day, I told my dad. He apparently is far more opposed to the vaccine than my mom (and probably everyone else in my immediate family), and when I told him, me and him launched into a debate for about an hour over the vaccine, talking about its effectiveness, safety, and legitimacy. He talked about how he believes the vaccine contains materials that the government and companies are hiding, that it can harm your immune system, and some of the conspiracy theories behind it, particularly how Bill Gates is supposedly deeply involved in the vaccine. I made it clear to him that I didn't make the decision lightly and did 2-3 hours of research for a reason. By the end of it all, he asked me if I could sit down with him and a regular client of his (my dad is a small business owner) for lunch to discuss the vaccine. I thought that the guy could maybe have some legitimate points, and that having more information to consider isn't necessarily a bad thing, so I thought why not, at least do it for my dad, who was genuinely worried about me and my health should I get the vaccine.

Today was said lunch with my dad and his client, who is a dentist who treats his patients holistically (or something along those lines) and has apparently done research on various vaccines for years. After introducing himself, he immediately proceeded to ask me the question ""Do you want to have kids?"". I naturally said yes; one of my life goals is to hopefully find the perfect girl, get married, and start a family one day. He then immediately said, ""Don't get the vaccine. Simple as that."" After that, he immediately proceeded to launch into a very big talk about a bunch of different supposed dangers with the vaccines. He also then proceeded to discuss that the vaccines and the pandemic are part of a conspiracy.

**Let me make it clear that I logically do** ***NOT*** **believe any of these following points.** All of these points I'm about to list are the primary factors that have launched this massive anxiety in me about the vaccine. Additionally, these are not all the points he discussed. I had a mental breakdown immediately following this talk and a lot of the conversation then became a blur in my memory. Here are some of those points he was claiming that I can remember, not in any particular order:

* The vaccine contains a material/ingredient (I forget the name) that is hidden from the general public that leaves both males and females who take the vaccines infertile, most likely permanently
* The reason behind this is to control the population and eventually reduce the global population to only 2 billion people
* The mRNA in the vaccine DOES interact with the DNA and DOES make permanent changes to the DNA, contrary to what the FDA and official sources say. I don't recall why.
* The mRNA in the vaccines causes a gene that helps fight cancerous cells in the human body to become permanently disabled, therefore dramatically increasing the possibility of cancer in the human body. The dramatically higher cancer rates are part of the plan to control and reduce the population.
* He claimed he knew people that said 5 local pregnant women in one suburb alone were forced to abort their fetuses because they all miscarried as a result of taking the vaccine
* He said one of his patients had a husband who was 40 years old, was an athlete in perfect health, and died in his sleep three weeks after receiving the COVID vaccine
* The vaccine interacts with only one of two parts of the immune system, leaving the immune system unbalanced while it produces the antibodies the vaccine instructs the immune system to make. As a result of this, if you are vaccinated and catch COVID-19, it could send your body into shock and kill you.
* The virus was released in 2020 in order to help elect Joe Biden and remove Donald Trump from office (I don't mean to start any political discussions)
* The virus was also released in order to largely increase mail-in voting and early voting in order to more easily rig the election in swing states (again, I don't mean to start any political discussions)
* To add to the point above, he said the current (?) audit in Arizona is legitimate and will find Trump the winner there
* Robert Kennedy (I don't remember who he is other than the fact he is a descendent of JFK) opposes the COVID vaccine and is trying to sound the alarm on how harmful this thing is
* Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci have thousands of patents on each COVID vaccine, and are profiting tremendously from the vaccine rollout (and the pandemic in general)
* ""Big Pharma's"" intentions with the vaccine are **only** to make profit, not to help end the pandemic
* Potential booster shots for 6-12 months down the line are only for Big Pharma to make more profit
* Pfizer and Moderna have apparently been caught in scandals before about lying about their stats. As such, Pfizer and Moderna lied about their statistics from the vaccine trials in order to get their vaccines approved
* Anthony Fauci was involved in the development of a virus at a lab in the United States, but the creation of said virus was moved to Wuhan in 2005 after the US government became suspicious
* COVID-19 absolutely did not originate in a wet market or from bats
* ALL the current COVID-19 vaccines were based on vaccines for different animals.
* The J&amp;J vaccine in particular was based on a vaccine that was abandoned by J&amp;J due to it being largely deadly for the monkeys said vaccine was meant for
* The Ebola outbreak a few years back was a test to see how the general population would react to a large-scale outbreak of a virus
* The current narratives on the COVID pandemic are meant to only instill fear in the general population to further cement control over the general public
* Masking and social distancing are completely useless
* The vast majority of vaccines have not benefitted humanity in the slightest, they have only worsened humanity and the human immune system
* Peanut allergies, gluten allergies, and other ""newer"" allergies have been caused by the large amount of vaccinations given to young children
* More children are becoming disabled due to the increasing amounts of vaccinations young children receive
* Young children today receive dozens of more vaccines compared to just a few years ago and this will make young children extremely sickly in the future
* The Polio vaccine, among others, have caused new variations of polio and other diseases
* A vaccine distributed by Bill Gates and his foundation in Africa (I do not remember for which disease) caused thousands of young women to become infertile
* HIV originated from a vaccine distributed in the 50s and 60s (I don't remember which one he said)
* The vaccine rollout ultimately is an experiment on the entire human population
* The ultimate endgame is for elites in various governments to gain totalitarian control of the government and usher in a ""new world order"" through ""the great reset""

**Again, I want to make it clear that I do** ***NOT*** **logically believe** ***ANY*** **of this to be true. These are the points that are feeding into my anxiety about the vaccine.**

The conversation lasted roughly an hour, and for the first 20 minutes or so, I would try and ask questions such as ""Why would they hide this?"", ""What is their endgame?"", ""Why would they even do this?"", and ""What do these people have to gain from doing all this?"". Eventually I gave up on asking questions and just let the man ramble on, because his answers were always either ""Well they want to control us"" or ""They are trying to hide things from us"" or something related to one of those two answers.

Following the conversation, I had a full on mental breakdown that lasted roughly an hour. The last time I suffered a mental breakdown of this scale was back in 2017 when I was struggling with anxiety and depression. I broke down because in that moment my faith in humanity had been completed wiped out by all the supposed evil, horrific things all these people were doing to harm their fellow man and gain wealth and power for themselves. If I'm being completely honest, the thought I had deep down was that I did not want to live in a world where that much evil exists (I'm ok now, I promise).

The way he talked about all those points and moved from one point to another was done so quickly, confidently, and eloquently in a way that just made it seem all so legitimate to me, even though I know it's a bunch of nonsense realistically speaking. He backed himself up by saying he has viewed dozens of different research papers and articles, and claims he knows many different people with negative experiences with the vaccine. I suppose the man technically is a doctor after all, even if he is a dentist.

But it just doesn't make sense to me. There can't be that many people in on a plan to harm and gain control over the general population; in my opinion, you would need tens of thousands of people, and with that many people in on it, people WOULD TALK! These scientists who developed the vaccine want to HELP AND NOT HARM humanity, and yet he made it seem the opposite was true so easily and with massive confidence.

That's the logical side of me refuting what he said, but despite how much I refute any of his points, the anxiety just does not go away. I can't help but have this feeling of **""what if it's all true?""** and worry deep down that if/when I get my COVID vaccine, I'm injecting a vaccine in me that will compromise my immune system, dramatically increase my chances of getting cancer, and eliminate my ability to one day start a family. I just can't stop thinking about the possible ""consequences"" I'd now be getting if I get the COVID vaccine.

I just do not genuinely know what to do. Before I had this conversation, I decided to get the COVID vaccine for a few reasons:

1. I figured I'd take my chances with a vaccine that appears to have no long term side effects according to research (that my dad's client would presumably call bullcrap) over my chances of dealing with ""Long COVID"" if I somehow got COVID, which is very real according to research
2. To contribute to overall herd immunity
3. To not have to quarantine for 14 days were I to be exposed to COVID
4. To help prevent my family, friends, and society as a whole from getting COVID
5. To go and see my (vaccinated) friends again and hopefully return to some sense of normal this summer or fall

I just really do not know what to do. I have talked to some of my closest friends about this situation and they have all shown support for me and listened to all this, which I'm extremely grateful for. Additionally, my dad apologized profusely for the conversation. It is my belief my dad was expecting me and his client to have a proper debate/conversation about the vaccine, rather than the eloquent conspiracy rampage that he ultimately went on. The guy gave me a folder containing a few articles in favor against the COVID vaccines, but my dad told me ""You do not have to read anything in here. If you get the shot and don't read any of this, I'll still fully support you."" That truly meant a lot to me, especially coming off of the mental breakdown I had right in front of him.

But ever since this conversation, I have had the anxiety of the COVID vaccine and all these supposed effects on myself deep down. I have nearly reached the point to where I almost just want to get the shot in order to force myself to think ""well I have the shot now, no going back"" instead of thinking ""what if?"". On top of that, I've also reached the point to where my logic and anxiety have sort of blended in a weird way. The big examples of that would be my thoughts of ""Well if the vaccine shuts off my ability to have children, ***good***. I don't want to have kids be born into a world of such evil anyway."" and ""If it kills me, well then I don't have to live in a world where the elites are trying to kill me anymore"". I know those thoughts are extremely unhealthy, but my anxiety has gotten so bad and I have had this conversation and my rebuttals to the conversation going through my mind so much that it's all just started to all come together so my brain can reach a conclusion and just ***stop*** thinking about it for one second.

I'm still currently scheduled to get my first shot on May 5th, which is most likely tomorrow if you are reading this thread. I don't know what to do with that appointment at this point in time.

But I guess that's about all the big points of what I've had to say. I know this thread is extremely long, so even if you've only managed to read this entire thing, **thank you so much from the bottom of my heart**. I just needed to express my feelings somewhere, and I feel like having some opinions of different people would be very productive and useful in helping me make a ***confident*** decision that is healthy for my mental health, physical health, and the health and wellbeing of others.",t2_1qkwf9bu,False,,0,False,"I genuinely WANT to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but I'm absolutely TERRIFIED of it now.",[],r/Anxiety,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_n4hpcb,False,light,0.7,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620138667.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before y&amp;#39;all read my thread I just wanna say this isn&amp;#39;t really a subreddit I&amp;#39;ve visited before; I mostly use my reddit account for memes, games, etc. so I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure where else to post this after looking at a few different subreddits; with that said I apologize if this happens to be in an inappropriate subreddit or if I&amp;#39;m violating any rules here (If so feel free to take this down mods), I just need somewhere to express my feelings and I&amp;#39;m guessing this is a proper place to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional background that may be helpful: I&amp;#39;m 20M, currently a college student (I&amp;#39;m not a med or biology student), and have struggled with anxiety and depression before, but thankfully not on a large scale for several years now. I follow all COVID regulations too, and I am absolutely not anti-mask, anti-vax, and anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if conspiracy theories can be a trigger for some people, but in case they are I&amp;#39;ll put that flair on this thread. If conspiracy theories are a trigger for you, please do not read my thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as the title suggests, I want to get the COVID shots but I&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;really, really scared&lt;/strong&gt; to get it now. My viewpoint with the vaccine has evolved over the past few months and especially the past few days, and this is what each phase so far for me has been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank God these are being rolled out for the elderly, vulnerable, and essential workers, but maybe I don&amp;#39;t really need this; I&amp;#39;m healthy and active as I possibly can be during the pandemic, so I think I can just depend on herd immunity being reached. (Nov 2020 - Feb 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe I could get the shot(s) to help contribute to herd immunity. I&amp;#39;m not too sure right now, so I&amp;#39;ll wait until enough of my friends, enough people that I follow on social media, and enough of the general population has had it to a point where it seems to be safe and effective for everyone. (Feb 2021 - Apr 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My threshold for seeing if it&amp;#39;s safe and effective among other people has now been met, and after having done about 2-3 hours of some research, it seems to be very safe and effective. I plan to have my first Pfizer shot on May 5th, and my second one May 26th (A few days ago - Yesterday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I really want to get this, but I&amp;#39;m really scared about what some of these conspiracies say. (Today)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to break down what led me to point #4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a lot of my family right now does not fully support the COVID vaccine. They aren&amp;#39;t anti-vax or anything like that, but they are highly skeptical of the COVID vaccine. They also do not oppose other people getting the vaccine either, as they believe it&amp;#39;s up each individual. Right now, both my parents and my older brother and sister do not plan on getting it. On the contrary, I have a sister-in-law who is pregnant but does plan on getting the Pfizer vaccine as soon as her child is born. I also have two younger sisters that are currently ineligible for the shot, but one of them will probably get it when she becomes eligible presumably later this summer. My mom&amp;#39;s parents have been fully vaccinated since February (even though they are more skeptical of vaccines in general), but to my knowledge nobody else in my extended family has the vaccine or is planning to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought my parents had every right to know; I am their kid after all so I&amp;#39;d figured I&amp;#39;d let them know. The day I decided to schedule my appointment for the vaccine, I told my mom. She is not opposed to me getting it at all, although she hasn&amp;#39;t been fully supportive either necessarily. She still does not plan on considering getting it until there are more long term studies on the vaccine, and her threshold for the amount of people who have it and are safe and ok is much higher than mine was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I told my dad. He apparently is far more opposed to the vaccine than my mom (and probably everyone else in my immediate family), and when I told him, me and him launched into a debate for about an hour over the vaccine, talking about its effectiveness, safety, and legitimacy. He talked about how he believes the vaccine contains materials that the government and companies are hiding, that it can harm your immune system, and some of the conspiracy theories behind it, particularly how Bill Gates is supposedly deeply involved in the vaccine. I made it clear to him that I didn&amp;#39;t make the decision lightly and did 2-3 hours of research for a reason. By the end of it all, he asked me if I could sit down with him and a regular client of his (my dad is a small business owner) for lunch to discuss the vaccine. I thought that the guy could maybe have some legitimate points, and that having more information to consider isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a bad thing, so I thought why not, at least do it for my dad, who was genuinely worried about me and my health should I get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was said lunch with my dad and his client, who is a dentist who treats his patients holistically (or something along those lines) and has apparently done research on various vaccines for years. After introducing himself, he immediately proceeded to ask me the question &amp;quot;Do you want to have kids?&amp;quot;. I naturally said yes; one of my life goals is to hopefully find the perfect girl, get married, and start a family one day. He then immediately said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t get the vaccine. Simple as that.&amp;quot; After that, he immediately proceeded to launch into a very big talk about a bunch of different supposed dangers with the vaccines. He also then proceeded to discuss that the vaccines and the pandemic are part of a conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me make it clear that I logically do&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;believe any of these following points.&lt;/strong&gt; All of these points I&amp;#39;m about to list are the primary factors that have launched this massive anxiety in me about the vaccine. Additionally, these are not all the points he discussed. I had a mental breakdown immediately following this talk and a lot of the conversation then became a blur in my memory. Here are some of those points he was claiming that I can remember, not in any particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccine contains a material/ingredient (I forget the name) that is hidden from the general public that leaves both males and females who take the vaccines infertile, most likely permanently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason behind this is to control the population and eventually reduce the global population to only 2 billion people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mRNA in the vaccine DOES interact with the DNA and DOES make permanent changes to the DNA, contrary to what the FDA and official sources say. I don&amp;#39;t recall why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mRNA in the vaccines causes a gene that helps fight cancerous cells in the human body to become permanently disabled, therefore dramatically increasing the possibility of cancer in the human body. The dramatically higher cancer rates are part of the plan to control and reduce the population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He claimed he knew people that said 5 local pregnant women in one suburb alone were forced to abort their fetuses because they all miscarried as a result of taking the vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He said one of his patients had a husband who was 40 years old, was an athlete in perfect health, and died in his sleep three weeks after receiving the COVID vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccine interacts with only one of two parts of the immune system, leaving the immune system unbalanced while it produces the antibodies the vaccine instructs the immune system to make. As a result of this, if you are vaccinated and catch COVID-19, it could send your body into shock and kill you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virus was released in 2020 in order to help elect Joe Biden and remove Donald Trump from office (I don&amp;#39;t mean to start any political discussions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virus was also released in order to largely increase mail-in voting and early voting in order to more easily rig the election in swing states (again, I don&amp;#39;t mean to start any political discussions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add to the point above, he said the current (?) audit in Arizona is legitimate and will find Trump the winner there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Kennedy (I don&amp;#39;t remember who he is other than the fact he is a descendent of JFK) opposes the COVID vaccine and is trying to sound the alarm on how harmful this thing is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci have thousands of patents on each COVID vaccine, and are profiting tremendously from the vaccine rollout (and the pandemic in general)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Big Pharma&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; intentions with the vaccine are &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; to make profit, not to help end the pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential booster shots for 6-12 months down the line are only for Big Pharma to make more profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pfizer and Moderna have apparently been caught in scandals before about lying about their stats. As such, Pfizer and Moderna lied about their statistics from the vaccine trials in order to get their vaccines approved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthony Fauci was involved in the development of a virus at a lab in the United States, but the creation of said virus was moved to Wuhan in 2005 after the US government became suspicious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 absolutely did not originate in a wet market or from bats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ALL the current COVID-19 vaccines were based on vaccines for different animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The J&amp;amp;J vaccine in particular was based on a vaccine that was abandoned by J&amp;amp;J due to it being largely deadly for the monkeys said vaccine was meant for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ebola outbreak a few years back was a test to see how the general population would react to a large-scale outbreak of a virus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current narratives on the COVID pandemic are meant to only instill fear in the general population to further cement control over the general public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masking and social distancing are completely useless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of vaccines have not benefitted humanity in the slightest, they have only worsened humanity and the human immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peanut allergies, gluten allergies, and other &amp;quot;newer&amp;quot; allergies have been caused by the large amount of vaccinations given to young children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More children are becoming disabled due to the increasing amounts of vaccinations young children receive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young children today receive dozens of more vaccines compared to just a few years ago and this will make young children extremely sickly in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Polio vaccine, among others, have caused new variations of polio and other diseases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vaccine distributed by Bill Gates and his foundation in Africa (I do not remember for which disease) caused thousands of young women to become infertile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV originated from a vaccine distributed in the 50s and 60s (I don&amp;#39;t remember which one he said)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccine rollout ultimately is an experiment on the entire human population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate endgame is for elites in various governments to gain totalitarian control of the government and usher in a &amp;quot;new world order&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;the great reset&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again, I want to make it clear that I do&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;logically believe&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ANY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of this to be true. These are the points that are feeding into my anxiety about the vaccine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation lasted roughly an hour, and for the first 20 minutes or so, I would try and ask questions such as &amp;quot;Why would they hide this?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What is their endgame?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why would they even do this?&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;What do these people have to gain from doing all this?&amp;quot;. Eventually I gave up on asking questions and just let the man ramble on, because his answers were always either &amp;quot;Well they want to control us&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;They are trying to hide things from us&amp;quot; or something related to one of those two answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the conversation, I had a full on mental breakdown that lasted roughly an hour. The last time I suffered a mental breakdown of this scale was back in 2017 when I was struggling with anxiety and depression. I broke down because in that moment my faith in humanity had been completed wiped out by all the supposed evil, horrific things all these people were doing to harm their fellow man and gain wealth and power for themselves. If I&amp;#39;m being completely honest, the thought I had deep down was that I did not want to live in a world where that much evil exists (I&amp;#39;m ok now, I promise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way he talked about all those points and moved from one point to another was done so quickly, confidently, and eloquently in a way that just made it seem all so legitimate to me, even though I know it&amp;#39;s a bunch of nonsense realistically speaking. He backed himself up by saying he has viewed dozens of different research papers and articles, and claims he knows many different people with negative experiences with the vaccine. I suppose the man technically is a doctor after all, even if he is a dentist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. There can&amp;#39;t be that many people in on a plan to harm and gain control over the general population; in my opinion, you would need tens of thousands of people, and with that many people in on it, people WOULD TALK! These scientists who developed the vaccine want to HELP AND NOT HARM humanity, and yet he made it seem the opposite was true so easily and with massive confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the logical side of me refuting what he said, but despite how much I refute any of his points, the anxiety just does not go away. I can&amp;#39;t help but have this feeling of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;what if it&amp;#39;s all true?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and worry deep down that if/when I get my COVID vaccine, I&amp;#39;m injecting a vaccine in me that will compromise my immune system, dramatically increase my chances of getting cancer, and eliminate my ability to one day start a family. I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about the possible &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d now be getting if I get the COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just do not genuinely know what to do. Before I had this conversation, I decided to get the COVID vaccine for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I figured I&amp;#39;d take my chances with a vaccine that appears to have no long term side effects according to research (that my dad&amp;#39;s client would presumably call bullcrap) over my chances of dealing with &amp;quot;Long COVID&amp;quot; if I somehow got COVID, which is very real according to research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To contribute to overall herd immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To not have to quarantine for 14 days were I to be exposed to COVID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help prevent my family, friends, and society as a whole from getting COVID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To go and see my (vaccinated) friends again and hopefully return to some sense of normal this summer or fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just really do not know what to do. I have talked to some of my closest friends about this situation and they have all shown support for me and listened to all this, which I&amp;#39;m extremely grateful for. Additionally, my dad apologized profusely for the conversation. It is my belief my dad was expecting me and his client to have a proper debate/conversation about the vaccine, rather than the eloquent conspiracy rampage that he ultimately went on. The guy gave me a folder containing a few articles in favor against the COVID vaccines, but my dad told me &amp;quot;You do not have to read anything in here. If you get the shot and don&amp;#39;t read any of this, I&amp;#39;ll still fully support you.&amp;quot; That truly meant a lot to me, especially coming off of the mental breakdown I had right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ever since this conversation, I have had the anxiety of the COVID vaccine and all these supposed effects on myself deep down. I have nearly reached the point to where I almost just want to get the shot in order to force myself to think &amp;quot;well I have the shot now, no going back&amp;quot; instead of thinking &amp;quot;what if?&amp;quot;. On top of that, I&amp;#39;ve also reached the point to where my logic and anxiety have sort of blended in a weird way. The big examples of that would be my thoughts of &amp;quot;Well if the vaccine shuts off my ability to have children, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t want to have kids be born into a world of such evil anyway.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;If it kills me, well then I don&amp;#39;t have to live in a world where the elites are trying to kill me anymore&amp;quot;. I know those thoughts are extremely unhealthy, but my anxiety has gotten so bad and I have had this conversation and my rebuttals to the conversation going through my mind so much that it&amp;#39;s all just started to all come together so my brain can reach a conclusion and just &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; thinking about it for one second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still currently scheduled to get my first shot on May 5th, which is most likely tomorrow if you are reading this thread. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with that appointment at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

But this year and last year it is a little hard to do that seeing as we're in a pandemic and I have been out of work for over a year. 
I don't seam to really have much to any friends. Last year I felt I had a solid 3 friends the most Ive had in a couple years I wanted to have a little sesh for my birthday so I invited them and a couple more from my college year over and that whole experience felt like when you are a child in primary school and you invite everyone in your class over and your class mates are forced by there parents to show up. It was quite depressing.
I feel so awkward and embarrassed about my birthday.
Another issue I have with my birthday is about the Instagram posts you know the ones people post on there stories tbh I think they are super cute and no hate but I get super embarrassed when I have only the one post from my boyfriend or my sister it's kinda awkward and last year I remember my boyfriend commented on the fact only 3 or 4 people posted about my birthday I then got a lil defencesive as I am a lil self conscious about having no friends (especially on Birthday x) so I tried to cover it up by telling him most people just sent me a happy birthday text.

,Anxiety,"(I'm not sure how to flair this, sorry) (repost after title mistake)
Last week was INSANE, I had so much to do and so many assignments and tests I only survived because had to 2 extra Monter cans stored(btw the iced tea one is not good), but when friday came (my only kinda free day) I was so tired I slept all day and missed therapy and I REALLY needed therapy Friday. Well, I slept the whole weekend and I can't believe it's still Tuesday.

Well, yesterday I bought some caffeine pills because they are way cheaper them energy drinks and it was probably not a good choice. I took one at 8pm, but it's now 5am. I'm not sure if it's the pill having a late kick in or the anxiety, either way I can't sleep and I can't focus enough to study.

The worst part is that I don't even like caffeine, I rarely drink coffee and all enegy drinks taste the same to me, but lately it started to look like a pretty good choice for late study sessions and it really helped the first few times, except it's also a very sucky choice for anxiety.

Last week was INSANE, I had so much to do and so many assignments and tests I only survived because had to 2 extra Monter cans stored(btw the iced tea one is not good), but when friday came (my only kinda free day) I was so tired I slept all day and missed therapy and I REALLY needed therapy Friday. Well, I slept the whole weekend and I can&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s still Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday I bought some caffeine pills because they are way cheaper them energy drinks and it was probably not a good choice. I took one at 8pm, but it&amp;#39;s now 5am. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s the pill having a late kick in or the anxiety, either way I can&amp;#39;t sleep and I can&amp;#39;t focus enough to study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that I don&amp;#39;t even like caffeine, I rarely drink coffee and all enegy drinks taste the same to me, but lately it started to look like a pretty good choice for late study sessions and it really helped the first few times, except it&amp;#39;s also a very sucky choice for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I was scrolling through xvideos and came across a thumbnail for one of the videos which they looked under the age of 18. Definitely not kid kids but they looked underage.

Thankfully people on reddit checked it out and helped me and said the people who made the video were legal adults.

Now I’m just not gonna go on xvideos again, not because they have underaged porn cuz The last one wasn’t even underage and this one might not be either and their policy is strictly against that. But because my anxiety is so bad that anything slightly questionable will trigger me and cause me to have severe anxiety.

,Anxiety,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety since I was in first grade but in middle school I used to have panic attacks daily on the way to school (was not a popular kid to say the least) and I’d always end up throwing up to the point we kept tooth paste and tooth brushes in the car because this was daily no exaggeration.  

Now as a 16 year old I can’t differentiate between feeling anxious and nausea.  I’ve had stomach flus and food poisoning I’ve very confusedly tried my strategies for bc I don’t know what triggered the “anxiety”.

&lt;p&gt;Now as a 16 year old I can’t differentiate between feeling anxious and nausea.  I’ve had stomach flus and food poisoning I’ve very confusedly tried my strategies for bc I don’t know what triggered the “anxiety”.   &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I’m going to preface this post by saying that it has no real structure and is a mix of ranting and asking for support. I talk like I’m looking back on my teenage self from the perspective of a 45 year old man and I’m not really sure why.

I am currently a junior in high school. Over the course of my time spent in high school, I’ve taken a majority AP classes with some honors classes thrown in. My teachers told me and my classmates that hard classes were the key to getting into a good college and that nowadays everybody who attended a good college had a 4.0 or higher so your classes needed to be harder to show your drive. I knew that getting into college had gotten incredibly competitive but I didn’t know it was to the point where having 10 - 12 AP classes with high A’s and B’s was normal. Before I go into more detail about my personal experience with this academic culture I want to say that I have no problem with putting in the work and this post is not meant to disguise a lack of effort or laziness as anxiety because I believe there is a relatively clear line between anxiety and not wanting to work hard. Anyway, as a junior I’ve taken 8 AP classes and have always pushed myself to make A’s because I had been told that that’s what is took to succeed in life. I know that millions of people make lower grades and take easier classes and still manage to do just as well if not better in life than those who pushed them in school. Despite this is still pushed myself to make only A’s in the hardest classes. I’ve never been good at managing stress about my grades so I always just buried it under more work and harder classes. Around September of 2019 I began waking up at night or early morning in cold sweats often dreading a test or fearing that I had forgotten to turn in an assignment. I developed a terrible lack of trust in myself which often manifested as having to check my google classroom at 1:00 am to make sure that I had turned in an assignment or having to rework every test question 3 times to make sure I circled the right answer. This cycle continued until about November of 2019 when I woke up one morning and immediately threw up. For the next  months I woke every morning and would throw up. My sleeping schedule broke down further and my eating habits basically stopped. Over those months I lost 20 pounds and continued to force myself to work more. I knew that what I was doing was bad but I honestly didn’t know how to fix it. People had told me that making B’s were gone and that most employers don’t care about stupid numbers like a GPA but I couldn’t convince my self that this was true. Dozens of people had to told me to relax because “Your just a kid” but I never could. I’m writing cause I figured that venting might help but I’m not sure at this point.
I’ve found myself feeling incredibly depressed almost all the time because of feeling overworked but knowing that it’s how I have to feel in order to get into a good college. I tell myself that taking a break is a good thing but never manage to to actually take one. Anyway I’m gonna wrap this up cause I feel like I’m reacting myself as this point.

Despite this is still pushed myself to make only A’s in the hardest classes. I’ve never been good at managing stress about my grades so I always just buried it under more work and harder classes. Around September of 2019 I began waking up at night or early morning in cold sweats often dreading a test or fearing that I had forgotten to turn in an assignment. I developed a terrible lack of trust in myself which often manifested as having to check my google classroom at 1:00 am to make sure that I had turned in an assignment or having to rework every test question 3 times to make sure I circled the right answer. This cycle continued until about November of 2019 when I woke up one morning and immediately threw up. For the next  months I woke every morning and would throw up. My sleeping schedule broke down further and my eating habits basically stopped. Over those months I lost 20 pounds and continued to force myself to work more. I knew that what I was doing was bad but I honestly didn’t know how to fix it. People had told me that making B’s were gone and that most employers don’t care about stupid numbers like a GPA but I couldn’t convince my self that this was true. Dozens of people had to told me to relax because “Your just a kid” but I never could. I’m writing cause I figured that venting might help but I’m not sure at this point.
I’ve found myself feeling incredibly depressed almost all the time because of feeling overworked but knowing that it’s how I have to feel in order to get into a good college. I tell myself that taking a break is a good thing but never manage to to actually take one. Anyway I’m gonna wrap this up cause I feel like I’m reacting myself as this point. I guess in short I simply don’t know what to do about this stress.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"TW: self-harm

I’ve been going to therapy for almost a year now. I’ve learned multiple ways of coping with my anxiety, setting boundaries, and understanding my own emotions and feelings. I slowly started learning how to not feel out of control when my anxiety levels are higher and it has been incredible. 
However, the last couple of months I felt like my anxiety has had a higher baseline. I swear some days there is a buzz that never goes away. It has even gotten to the point where the thought of cutting has slipped into my thoughts now and then (it’s been 2 years this week since the last time, and I have no desire to cut again so I’m good y’all 🙏 ). But the fact that I had, when it’s been months since the last time I thought about  it, was a little scary. 
It made me realize that even though I could manage and deal with my anxiety much more effectively on a day to day basis, that doesn’t mean my underlying anxiety level would go away or not increase. I had been debating about asking my therapist about medication. I was worried that I didn’t have a high enough level of anxiety for me to need medication, that I still have anxiety because I’m not doing enough to “get over it,” and even that I may not actually have anxiety at all. 
Then this last weekend, I couldn’t enjoy taking one single day off from school work (I’m in grad school) to hang out with friends. I kept nearly crying and had shortness of breath all day. The night before I was laying in bed sobbing while my girlfriend just held me until I feel asleep. I was finally fed-up with dealing it with it almost every single day since as long as I can remember. So when I had my therapy session today, I let my therapist know that I thought medication would be helpful for me, and she agreed!! It made me feel like I haven’t been making up what I’ve been feeling or exaggerating it which was such a relief. I have a meeting next week to connect with a psychiatrist and hopefully figure out some medication soon! 
If you have actually read this far and have any advice/tips/comments about starting medication I’d love to hear them. I mainly wanted to share here because reading through posts on this sub helped me feel comfortable enough asking my therapist about medication. I hope this will maybe help others do the same

This morning I was woken up with heart attack symptoms - chest tightness, short of breath, left arm weakness and tingling ect.

I was really close to paying another visit to the ER but as usual after about 40 minutes the symptoms have eased. I did the 4-7-8 breathing. My arm and legs still feel strange but the chest tightness has eased and I feel more relaxed.

Im sick of this, as I always instantly go into “im having a heart attack” mode. And I always feel like I waste the doctor’s time, even though thats what they’re there for and its always better to be safe. But I cant help like Im wasting their time you know?

Does anyone have any advice on what I could do during these attacks? I do the breathing but is there anything else?

,Anxiety,"(Trigger alert. I would like to tell that English is not my first language, so gramatical errors can appear, sorry xD)


So, i'm 16M and i do therapy since March 2021 because of a fear that i have about being robbed or worse. Why? Let's go back to 2019, when I was 14.

My aunt's house suffered practically a heist that i think has been planned some days before this happened. The thieves were armed, pointing the guns to my relatives in this house and they taked everything (luckily they managed to recover almost everything they lost). Weirdly, in that time, i was a bit scared but for the rest of the year I was not thinking about this anymore because i was occupied with school and another chores. I started to have this fear by March 2020, when my school closed (pandemic issues).

So why i'm scared for a thing that NOT happened with my on my house with my family? Simple, i'm always thinking that this COULD happened to me. Everytime. Because of this, i started to fear night, my doors open at night and anything related to robbery and bad people breaking into my house. Sadly this is a reality on my country on dangerous cities and places but i live on a ""peaceful"" town. 

I had a series of episodes of anxiety crisis on nights and thanks to reading some breathing tactics on this subreddit i managed to ease these situations, so this is an little advance.

,Anxiety,"Hi all,
21 yo male here with diagnosed with GAD for a few years now. I've been taking Prozac since I was diagnosed and while it has helped my anxiety immensely, it's come with some very embarrassing and frustrating side effects, the most being it killing my ability to come...I had a girl over to my apartment for the first time in a while and she was gorgeous, and we got into it and we're having a great time. Fast forward about an hour plus and we're still going. She stops it and excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and comes back wanting to go home. She sits on the bed next to me and says ""sorry you didn't...you know..."" And I brushed it off like ""I have a bunch of stamina"" or whatever and then drove her home. I feel incredibly embarrassed and am hating myself. I have Welbutrin to counteract these effects but since I didn't wake up expecting to get laid I didn't take it and it's begun this negative thought cycle of hating the way I am. I wish every single day to be neurotypical...do I have it as bad as some people do? Not even close. But, I just wish I didn't need medication to get my emotions under control in the first place. I know this is irrational, but it's difficult for me to focus on anything else at the moment. I doubt I'll hear back from her at all, which just has me feeling worse about myself. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far. Hope you all are doing well or as well as can be given your current situation.

,Anxiety,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post in the Anxiety community of reddit. I've been lurking for months, though, and I need advice. Badly.  
Lately I have been experiencing crippling anxiety (both health anxiety and general anxiety). I just had a breakdown about 30 minutes ago thinking about the future.  
I am so UNBELIEVABLY terrified of the future. I am currently dating a beautiful girlfriend, who I love, and I have an amazing family. I'm going to marry my girlfriend one day, probably some day soon (I'm 21), and I am horrified of one day losing her.  
I'll outright say it: I am terrified of watching her, one day, pass away before I do. I don't want to marry someone and live my life with someone just for them to pass away and leave me all alone. This is so ridiculously frightening to me. I've had thoughts like these before in the past for my parents and siblings (especially my little brother), but recently my anxiety has been worse than it has ever been.   


I also understand and value life more than I ever have, but due to extreme health anxiety (aka hypochondria) I haven't been able to feel comfortable since Mid January at this point. I know there is a subreddit specific to health anxiety, so I won't go into it too deep here, but I have essentially worried continuously that some kind of debilitating illness will either kill me or permanently change my life in a bad way.  


My anxiety is ruining my life. It's making me feel symptoms that probably aren't actually there, and it's ruining some of the relationships of those closest to me... even hurting my relationship with my girlfriend.  


Has anyone gotten through something similar to this? Does anyone have advice that could help? Please... share anything you think could be beneficial.

Dr. Google and I have been having a field day. I'm convinced he'll have an aorta anyresume before his appointment in two months, that he's doomed, that maybe I have it too my arms are a little long, I'm stalking his family members FBS and Instagrams looking for signs of it, or ways to prove he doesn't have it, ""See!

That's definitely not because he had a growth spurt, and also used to be very overweight, CLEARLY IT'S MARFANS AND AN AORTA ANYRESUME IS IMPENDING.

I'm losing my appetite, and I'm afraid I'm going to drive everyone away with this behavior. Death consumes me.

,Anxiety,"Sooo, a *huge* part of my anxiety is rooted in the feelings surrounding being nauseas and/or throwing up. Truthfully, I don’t mind throwing up at all. I actually get an endorphin rush (like a runner’s high) from it- what I can’t stand at all is the nausea leading up to it. 

What’s even worse though is that one of the major symptoms of my anxiety is, you guessed it- nausea. When I had my first anxiety attack last year, it lasted almost three days off-and-on. I would get anxious, feel nauseas, lose my appetite, and when I finally calmed down my stomach would hurt so bad from hunger that it’s freak me out back into anxiety. 

Prior to my anxiety I’d basically just have full-on meltdowns when I was sick with a stomach bug. Panicked walking and talking, crying, almost like a stress-induced temper tantrum but all the anger was just utter despair. I haven’t been sick since my anxiety, but just last week I was constipated and it *almost* sent me spiraling like my first anxiety attack.

Now, I’m getting my second dose of the vaccine tomorrow (Moderna). I’m a 20 year-old male, and before this pandemic I would’ve said I had a fairly good immune system (I haven’t been sick beyond a cold for a few years, knocking on wood). My first shot had basically zero side affects other than fatigue, and as far as I know I’ve never caught COVID prior. 

Today my friend said her friend got the first dose and was fine- when she got the second of the Moderna though she ended up puking her guts out for a whole day and that thought alone has made me so anxious it’s getting hard to even talk about it without my tummy getting mad at me. 

I’m *TERRIFIED* this second dose will make me ill, and all the doctors are saying “Stronger immune systems=stronger reactions”, and “if you had weak side effects the first time then expect stronger ones the second time”, etc. 

So now I have a dilemma; What if I get the shot and throw up? Will my anxiety attack stop this time, or will I be caught in that loop again? Last time I FORCED myself to eat 5 crackers and almost threw them up every bite... it took two hours to eat them. Then I had to force down an actual meal. I can’t do that again, that one incident left me with “after shocks” of anxiety attacks for a whole month. 

Then there’s the alternative- I get no symptoms... but what if I worry SO MUCH about them that I give myself those symptoms? With my first dose I hadn’t even known there were side effects until immediately before getting them, and all I thought was that they were a fever and chills and there was a tiny chance I’d be allergic... just that limited information made my heart rate elevate the rest of the day. 

I’m really wigging out about it now, and I’m starting to flat out consider not even getting the second dose which is completely irrational and stupid but, then again- if I had to choose between staying isolated for another year versus having even 3 days of that anxiety again, I’d choose the isolation in a heart beat.

i was already shitting bricks upon arrival, but after this i was almost in tears.

When I approached her, I was only expecting to say hello and then move on to the next person.. however, i got caught off guard. I said hello, she said hello, then she asked me a question to start a conversation. Oh fuck. my mind was racing trying to keep up some small talk, and eventually i just went into panic mode, turned, and walked away. I felt so embarrassed the whole rest of the wedding and tried to avoid her as much as possible. Even now i still cringe about it..

The worst part about this incident (and anxiety generally) is that I don't have any negative feelings toward her, yet she probably thinks i do from the way I acted. That or she just saw how pathetic I am socially.

,Anxiety," Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. I'll try to be quick and not waste anyone's time. I'm 23 and have been suffering from waking up too early since I was 15. I used to get a great nine hours of sleep every night and never worried about sleeping problems but then all of a sudden I started waking up at the same time my mom would get up at 4:45 AM and I would be going to bed around 9:30 PM. I thought this was strange and it would pass but it kept occurring every night and I would feel so like anxious in the morning and I wouldn't be able to fall back asleep. Then, I would start waking up feeling this pulsing sensation from my heart in my head and I feel my pulse whenever now. Fast forward from 15 to 23 and I'm still dealing with waking up early. I only get around 6 to 7 hours a sleep night if I'm lucky. I have no real medical problems. I've had my blood drawn and gotten a lot of tests and nothing has come up positive except for a cortisol level that was very low once. Here are some of the medications and supplements I've been on

* Melatonin
* Vitamin D3
* Ashwaghanda
* Benadryl
* Klonopin
* Trazodone
* Serqouil
* Mirtazapine
* Buspirone
* Flexeril
* Lunesta
* Vicodin

It's like every day no matter what I'll wake up after 6-7 hours and I'll feel very groggy with this crusty feeling in my eyes but I'll almost feel wide awake at the same time with the way my heart is pounding and my thoughts are going. I'm constantly doing therapy, yoga, weightlifting and everything else. I'm active and have tried so much to fix this problem. I feel like my quality of life has been truly degraded and that my life has been affected so negatively by all of this. The only time I ever gotten sold sleep from all of this was a couple nights when I was taking vicodin and I was prescribed it for my herniated disc. Thank you for taking the time to read this. It honestly has made me so depressed and anxious when I should be enjoying the best years of my life. Please let me know if you have any advice or questions.

,Anxiety,"-Warning might be triggering to some. Talking about violent and serious topics- 
        Not gonna sugar coat my experiences w OCD bc that’s dumb.     

So I have diagnosed OCD, and rn I’m gonna be specifically talking about Harm OCD. Which is basically violent intrusive thoughts/fears of either hurting yourself/others, or others getting hurt, suicide etc... simply making this to spread awareness of how this type of ocd can get and hopefully make others w it; feel not alone:) (((((REMEMBER EVERYBODY’S EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT. this is just MY experience.))))feel free to share stories, it interests me a lot how weird the brain can be. 
One example of having one of these intrusive thoughts,  which happened to me was

When I was sitting down around midnight. My family was all asleep but I heard something make a “thud” noise in the distance. So immediately I thought my mother had hung herself. I almost jumped off the couch to go check downstairs (where she was sleeping) but I tried to sit back. I remember just telling myself it was a stupid thought and it wasn’t real but I then had another intrusive thought telling me if I didn’t go NOW then it would be too late to save her when I make it downstairs and that it was all gonna be my fault. So of course I ran downstairs and carefully opened the door, preparing myself to see my moms body hanging. But I was extremely relieved once i saw her sleeping- but I had to check whether she was breathing or not. Afterwards my anxiety finally went away and I went back upstairs.

        Not gonna sugar coat my experiences w OCD bc that’s dumb.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have diagnosed OCD, and rn I’m gonna be specifically talking about Harm OCD. Which is basically violent intrusive thoughts/fears of either hurting yourself/others, or others getting hurt, suicide etc... simply making this to spread awareness of how this type of ocd can get and hopefully make others w it; feel not alone:) (((((REMEMBER EVERYBODY’S EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT. this is just MY experience.))))feel free to share stories, it interests me a lot how weird the brain can be. 
One example of having one of these intrusive thoughts,  which happened to me was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was sitting down around midnight. My family was all asleep but I heard something make a “thud” noise in the distance. So immediately I thought my mother had hung herself. I almost jumped off the couch to go check downstairs (where she was sleeping) but I tried to sit back. I remember just telling myself it was a stupid thought and it wasn’t real but I then had another intrusive thought telling me if I didn’t go NOW then it would be too late to save her when I make it downstairs and that it was all gonna be my fault. So of course I ran downstairs and carefully opened the door, preparing myself to see my moms body hanging. But I was extremely relieved once i saw her sleeping- but I had to check whether she was breathing or not. Afterwards my anxiety finally went away and I went back upstairs. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"My anxiety has gotten so bad over the years at this point I keep avoiding any and all messages, emails, responsibilities even the ones I want to respond to. They keep piling up and I just can't seem to get to them. I'm so depressed too that I don't even have the energy to respond to people anymore. In fact, even people who I somehow reached out to. I can't even respond to them and I keep hating myself and bashing myself for that because I feel terrible but I just can't bring myself to do it. I've had migraines sinus and stomach issues for years because of anxiety but it's gotten so bad now that I can't even study because of the emotional and physical pain. These past few days I've been having panic attack after panic attack, hourly. Sometimes I start crying without any reason, I'm panicking all the time. And because I'm always anxious and depressed, it makes me even more anxious. Even reaching out at this point makes me so anxious. Venting here seems like a last resort, just to try to get it out at least. My heart rate is so irregular and I feel weak and dizzy. I can't even eat right anymore ever since I stopped eating proper food a month ago. Even the food I do manage to eat I try to vomit it out of my system. And the anxiety doesn't help with the nausea.

,Anxiety,"

Here are your steps. I PROMISE that if you practice these steps, you will feel better. However, anxiety only waxes and wanes over the life course, it doesn’t go away.

1: STOP. 
Remember, this is anxiety which means disordered thinking, and I must stop my thoughts and physical symptoms.

2: BREATHE:
Focus on your breathing. Oxygen to your brain tells the limbic system you are not under assault. Breath like a baby does. Be sure to breathe and allow your stomach to rise and fall. This is truly breathing through your diaphragm, which is essential to breathing to minimize your anxiety.

3: RELAX
When you are experiencing anxiety, pay attention to your body. Where do you feel it? Focus on relaxing shoulders, etc. wherever you feel it. 

4: THINK: 
I am okay. I need to change my thoughts. There is no threat in this moment. In this moment, I am powerless over my worry. In this moment, I can direct my focus to my environment. What’s the temp, how do my clothes feel, I will breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds, or anything that brings your thoughts into THIS moment. You must get yourself to believe that everything really is going to be ok. This is your anxiety.

I PROMISE that if you practice these steps, you will feel better. However, anxiety only waxes and wanes over the life course, it doesn’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: STOP. 
Remember, this is anxiety which means disordered thinking, and I must stop my thoughts and physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: BREATHE:
Focus on your breathing. Oxygen to your brain tells the limbic system you are not under assault. Breath like a baby does. Be sure to breathe and allow your stomach to rise and fall. This is truly breathing through your diaphragm, which is essential to breathing to minimize your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: RELAX
When you are experiencing anxiety, pay attention to your body. Where do you feel it? Focus on relaxing shoulders, etc. wherever you feel it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4: THINK: 
I am okay. I need to change my thoughts. There is no threat in this moment. In this moment, I am powerless over my worry. In this moment, I can direct my focus to my environment. What’s the temp, how do my clothes feel, I will breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds, or anything that brings your thoughts into THIS moment. You must get yourself to believe that everything really is going to be ok. This is your anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps will often  have to be repeated over and over within minutes until you gain control. Practice will make perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Today I was meeting up with friends for a walk. We were just getting started when I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me but I tried to ignore it, as I always do, because it's not the first time it's happened during our walks. As we were going the feeling was only becoming more unbearable and hard to hide. I had started to think of possible excuses so I could go home and calm down.

Unfortunately the feeling transitioned into a panic attack. Before, I used to have a few panic attacks a day, and of course it was a living hell but I was better at managing and hiding them. I told my friends I was taking some medication bc I got an allergic reaction recently and that it had side effects which made me dizzy and made my head spin. My mind was full of 'run, run, run'. But my friends being concerned about me insisted on staying by my side until I got home. I tried to tell them that I'd be fine and they could just continue their walk but they kept going along with me. I was walking a bit faster than them because I wanted to be home quickly and then I couldn't help myself anymore and started to run away. I didn't know what to do afterwards, I felt a bit better because I was alone and 'ran away from the danger' but I couldn't face them anymore, so I went home. I have no idea what they must be thinking. I kind of feel like my body betrayed me in hopes of getting some help. Of course, after I got home I messaged them to say sorry. 

I wish I was strong enough to tell them the truth. I'm afraid because every time I've told anyone they either didn't believe me or ignored it, so I told myself I had to deal with it on my own. But recently it's getting harder to shut up. I hope they don't hate me.

I know I should just tell them but I really can't bring myself to do it, no matter how many times I'd try. In my country, mental health is still a very taboo topic so it makes it even harder. I'll try looking for help from a psychiatrist but I'm not able to do it atm.

,Anxiety,"In the last year I’ve suffered from higher than normal anxiety due to environmental factors. I was doing very fine in life until I recently bought a house for my wife, child and myself. I’m used to moving from house to house renting and moving after the lease is up, so this being my permanent residence has altered my perspective on life q tad bit in concerns of safety.

Well in the last year I’ve received 2 death threats from 2 separate people, for 2 personal separate reasons. One guy was upset his baby’s mother was in my inbox trying to “flirt” with me, and the other was from an old drug dealer friend who lashed out after a petty argument. 

These 2 events threw me in a constant state of worry. All day. 24/7. Knowing that I work 12 hours a day and my wife and child are at home, my levels of anxiety have been shot up so high because the worry of threats in the last year.

3 months ago, while stoned, I had a panic attack. Not understanding why or how, I had a full blown panic attack. Absolutely nothing triggered it. I’m now starting to understand that my nervous system must be sensitive and on high alert, which is probably why I had one. I quit smoking, but the panic attacks still come every other week. After my last panic attack I believe it triggered a major anxiety issue, where now every second of the day I’m constantly in fear or worrying over my own thoughts. These thoughts consist of “am I going crazy? Am I psychotic? What if my brain is broken? What’s wrong with me?” On loop every single day, further intensifying the feeling of anxiety and worry to the point where I can’t think about anything else.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

So, I really hate my job. I'm currently looking for another one (but as you can imagine, it's taking a while with the whole pandemic business).

I recently changed role in my organisation, which has made things a little better, but unfortunately I still have to deal with some old things from my previous role. I can't emphasise how much I hated this job, I was off sick for about 3 weeks last year because my anxiety got so bad, I was even having panic attacks.

Anyway, so every time I take a day any time off work or the Sunday, I am basically up until 3 am. I get overwhelming anxiety about work. I don't even know why I get so anxious, I just feel like something terrible is going to happen (even though when I start it's *usually* fine).

,Anxiety,"So, I'm \[24M\] currently on treatment of what's possibly a Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but my main issues right now are related to attention, memory and issues waking up. I've been struggling with these issues since I was a teenager, and they've became increasingly worse, now (during the pandemic) getting even worse. I started therapy almost a year and a half ago, and a year ago I've began treating my anxiety with medication. At first, I've began taking 75mg Venlafaxine, which really helped with my mood and overall somatic symptoms, but did nothing to my focus issues. Raising to 150mg made no difference at all, so my psychiatrist prescribed 150mg Bupropion along with 75 mg Venlafaxine. At day one i've felt really different, almost like I was cured, but then I've felt absolutely no difference. Increasing it to 300mg also didn't make a difference, only made it worse. So now I've been almost two weeks on 10mg Escitalopram and 37,5mg Venlafaxine (to stop taking it after a month). 

I know these medications take time, but I feel sometimes like nothing is changing and I'm lost in an indeffinite cycle of being completely inattentive and being unable to finish  (or even begin) the majority of my tasks (related to work, college or even everyday life), or even to focus on the present moment while I'm with people I like or doing things I enjoy. I've done a Neuropsychological evaluation and the neurpsychologist concluded I don't have ADHD, but sometimes i can't help but think that it might be my diagnosis and I've been misdiagnosed. I'm not sure what exactly I'm saying here, I'm just really tired of everything, and every change I make in my life (from autocompassion, to meditation etc) changing almost nothing on how much I fail to function in a normal way. I can't stand not being able to work properly, or focusing on the things I'm doing. And I also feel like anxiety treatment doesn't really focus on attention issues. And my therapist (a psychanalist) thinks I'm too focused on getting a diagnosis, and also really focuses on the psychological aspects of my disorder, while I think I should also explore the cognitive and neurological aspects of it.

About 2.5 months ago I developed an unremitting tension headache.. I’ve been given every test under the sun (mri, cat scan, lumbar puncture) and have given every pain killer (morphine, naproxen sodium etc). The headaches are so debilitating I am currently on a medical leave from work. 

After seeing a headache specialist he decided they were chronic tension headaches or chronic migraine (I definitely know they’re not the latter).  He put me on topamax to see if it will bring any relief. 

I MADE A HUGE break through the other day - I took a chlonazapam and my headache subsided EXPONENTIALLY. I thought it was a coincidence so I tried again the next day and aha - subsided again. So it appears these headaches are severe anxiety/ tension headaches.

Going back about a month ago I had my first panic attack. It ended with me in the hospital with tingling, slurred words and clenched hands. I was told I hyperventilated. I was running on maybe 3-4 hours a sleep a night and slightly abusing adderal. It was hands down the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Fast forward to present day, I just don’t feel the same; one day I’m perfectly fine and the next I feel anxious. I’ve had the fast heart rate and tingles again but I’ve been able to calm myself down. I believe that all along I’ve been trying to cope with this buried anxiety for years through my drinking. I don’t drink everyday, but when I do, I don’t know when to stop. I’m going to take a long break from any alcohol and most certainly not taking adderal again. It seems like the more I think about the anxiety, the more anxious I get. A vicious cycle. 

Does anybody have any advice? Are there any supplements that have helped you? I would much rather stay away from the Xanax route etc. I’m a 30 year older man btw.

,Anxiety,"So this is my first post not sure if I’ll be doing anything wrong as far as guidelines but just needed to tell someone...

So I don’t often tell people I have anxiety... I don’t like to act as if I can diagnose myself. 
I’ve never been to the doctor for it but I don’t know what else to say to myself anymore to make it all just bearable. The past year and a half, maybe two, have been pretty rough for me in that aspect. 

Yesterday I decided to get a haircut but I forgot all the barbers I like are closed Sundays. 
So this morning I decided I would go after work. 
I called my wife during lunch and let her know id be doing so, of course she says go ahead. 
I went online to check in and I set myself up for 4:45 as I get out at 4:30. 

I pulled up to the place and walk inside. Tell the lady I checked in online and I’d be comfortable waiting. Well, I was for a short period. 

It’s like it just creeps up on me and for no apparent reason. 
I’m looking at the time get shorter and shorter on the little tv showing the wait list and I can’t help but feel like my heart is beating so fast. 
When I have what I consider to be anxiety attacks I often get dry mouth and I feel like I can hear everything. I tried to convince myself just to do it. That if I ended up being overwhelmed I could just lie and say I needed to use the restroom for a way to catch my breath... 
I waited all the way till it said one minute, then I could feel my chest tighten. 
I decided to fake a phone call and walk out before they could call my name and there was no way back...
I feel really stupid and I hate myself for this. It sounds so trivial on the surface. I just wanted a damn haircut. 
They called me on the phone and I just ignored it. I went home to smoke a cigarette and do homework instead.

,Anxiety,"When experiencing anxiety, I presume a level of scheming that's outright diabolical behind everyone's behavior and I paint the gloomiest possible narratives by connecting dots in my head that have no place being in relation to each other. Recently becoming aware of this fact, I encouraged myself to do the opposite - assume positive intent wherever possible. It worked, but only in that I recognized the futility of either method. 

There is no limit to the negative or positive explanations you can give yourself, meaning the outcome is completely subjective and has no bearing on the reality of the situation. So stop letting your mind spin either narrative. The only solution, however hard this is to achieve, is to stop dwelling on it at all. 

How might this actually play out in life? Well you can start by taking people at face value. Would it be legitimately devastating to place all your trust in someone and then have them turn around and stab you in the back? Without a doubt, but only for so long until one day you can pick yourself up and stand even taller. But to assume the worst of everyone, on the other hand, that's how you sabotage every relationship before it ever even begins. And then when things fall apart, you're only further engrained in your ways. You tell yourself that this is only proof of your right to worry, that you were right about their malintent all along. You will never break the cycle this way. 

So just submit. Just ride the wave and roll with the punches and love when and wherever you can. Weed may help with this.

,Anxiety,"Hi all, apologies for the long read ahead...

I've suffered with anxiety in some form for as long as i can remember. The first incident that really set it off was when i was in first school, long story short i injured myself and felt trapped/like i was in a dream and it took a long time for me to calm down. As a direct result after that, i missed a lot of school, and developed a fear of life and going outside which led to me missing a lot of school. I also developed OCD and had a problem with washing my hands and light switches etc, which eventually subsided but took other forms as i grew older.

I spent a lot of my later teenage years and early twenties abusing substances, starting with light drugs and eventually harder ones, but never anything i would class as 'extremely dangerous' (heroin, cocaine, meth, etc) and after a bad experience on cannabis + hallucinogenics and the birth of my first son, i packed those in and turned straight to alcohol, which continued into my mid-twenties.

After that, i stopped hanging out with the friends who were into those things and developed healthier addictions in the form of martial arts/combat sports. This is the happiest point in my life, from the ages of around 26-30. I was heavily into the sports and had very few panic attacks/anxiety issues during that time. I drank very little and no longer abused any substances. I had a great job and was getting promoted frequently in a career i loved, but i was 'alone', i lived with my parents and was unhappy in the relationship department.

Fast forward a bit (age 29 ish) i met the love of my life and current fiancee/partner. She has mental health history of anxiety herself and has and still is receiving medication. I left my old job and got an even better job with more pay in a busier city center, and started working a lot more in order to provide for mine and her children from previous relationships.

Not long after i moved in with her and got this new job, it started to look as though i just couldn't juggle keeping fit in combat sports, working to get more money into the house and everything else going on, so i gave up the gym and training sessions so i could spend more time with the family and working.

About half way through 2019 i developed the shingles, which i've never had before and turns out it was a result of stress. Luckily, i'm extremely good at my job and am capable of doing it remotely, so after discussions with my boss i was allowed to work from home.

Just before COVID hit early 2020, in December of 2019 i was extremely ill with what we now suspect (but didn't know at the time) could have been COVID. It was like the flu, but far worse than i've ever had it. So bad that i had to call an ambulance out as i was being sick and couldn't breathe properly or keep food down. The ambulance workers took my vitals and just advised me to rest and it was nothing more than the flu, but remember this is just before COVID hit the mainstream.

When COVID finally hit and the country locked down, i was put on furlogh, but i had just asked my partner to marry me a few months prior, just had the promotion to manager for the company and we had literally just secured a mortgage for a new house. This is where my mental breakdown happened, and to this day while we don't know what caused it, we suspect it was the combined stress of all three of those. I was put onto valium (which is pretty rare in UK from what i can gather) and Sertraline. My OCD (particularly ROCD) was at it's heights, i kept questioning life and my relationship, whether i was capable of providing and maintaining the house payments and if i truly loved my partner, which killed me because i couldn't understand why i was thinking those thoughts.

Eventually, we moved to the new house while i was still in furlogh and the script for valium ran out. The sertraline helped with my reactions emotionally to the issues i was experiencing, but didn't prevent them at all. I underwent CBT which helped very little, but it was nice to hear someone acknowledging my struggles and confirming them on the GAD9 chart, my generalised anxiety was pretty shocking.

After struggling in the new house remotely working for about a year, i decided to stop taking the Sertraline and wean off of it. because the doctor kept adding 50mg every time i told them it wasn't working. I took matters into my own hands and started vaping CBD flowers, which worked fairly well, better than the SSRIs, but was very expensive (about 100-150 pound a month), and i wish i had stopped there. In order to get a more consistent but cheaper supply, i signed up for legal cannabis in the UK through prescription. This was a bad idea, as i was given CBD + THC oil and this brought back all my issues from a teenager in terms of bad experiences. The one night i took the oil, it felt like i was having the worst panic attack of my life, so i stopped taking the oil and immediately reverted back to SSRIs and Mirtazipine (for insomnia). 

I did switch from Sertraline this time to Prozac which is known to help with OCD better, which is definitely something i still have (intrusive thoughts that bother me, the compulsion to do certain things).

While i was receiving the new treatments, i requested another course of CBT tailored for OCD and also signed myself up on the NHS for an ADHD appointment as from reading into that, it seemed i met a lot of the criteria/symptoms. It was confirmed about 2 weeks ago that i do show signs of ADHD and was put onto Elvanse (lidexamphetamine) but have stopped taking this now as it exacerbates my anxiety.

The long and short of it is that i'm still left with symptoms (brain fog/blank head/confusion/insomnia/panic attack/lack of concentration) and am on a mix of drugs to try and help with those, but am sure that some may even be causing/making some of that worse. I'm actively trying to contact a private psychiatrist as i've been trying to save up money by going the NHS route, but it's proving pointless currently as i've been suffering for a long time.

I'm not here looking for free psychiatrist or professional help, but just advice and perhaps even similar stories if anyone can related. Am i alone? Am i fucked up from the drugs i did when i was younger and just haven't noticed it until now? Am i not cut out for working and providing for a family?

It seems all of this got 10 times worse when i got a successful, well paying job (the stress and mental breakdown).

I know i love my partner, the thought of not being with her kills me, but the thought of staying with her for the rest of our lives while i'm like this and the burden i obviously am is equally as bad.

I'm the sole provider for the family in terms of income, but this actually works better for us as my partner takes care of the kids school runs and most of the household stuff while i work a bit earlier/later to progress. She tries looking for work on the side but the current climate for her skills is a swamp due to COVID lay offs.

My job is great. Yes i do way too much and my CEO is aware of this, he doesn't want me to leave and i'm about to get my third pay rise here and my role migrated from management to a more technical one.

TLDR; Suffered with anxiety all my life from a young age and suspect i've been finding coping mechanisms in the form of substances, fitness etc until now. I bury myself into my work and hyper-focus on things i can control to avoid reality. I used to be really fit and healthy, but am now older and spend most of my days working remotely in bed, not maintaining my health or stress levels appropriately.

,Anxiety,"A bit more than two months ago I started medication and my psychiatrist prescribed me Clotiazepam to ease my anxiety while the antidepressant started making effect. 
However I had to change medication and I kept with the Benzos (15 drops, 6 mg, three times a day) for a bit longer than I would've liked. Now I'm supposed to be cutting a drop every few days but last weeks I've been feeling extra anxious, like my body is stressed but I'm mentally ok. 
All day I feel some sort of tension, restlessness in my feet, headaches, insomnia, sometimes, tension in my jaw as if I was clenching it very hard. 
I'm confused, I didn't expect this to happen cause I've been taking it for just a few weeks and reducing the dosage very slowly...

,Anxiety,"I (19 F) have experienced pretty bad anxiety on and off for about 7 years now and I think I’m finally at the breaking point and need help. I’ve never went to the doctors because I’m embarrassed and I also try to convince myself I’m making up my anxiety in my head and that I don’t really need help or even a diagnosis whatsoever because I’m just taking it. My dad also struggles with both anxiety and depression which for some reason makes me feel even more embarrassed and uncomfortable admitting that I might need help. My struggles could never compare to his and I know my parents will think I’m a fake or that they won’t fully grasp that I struggle too.

Anyway what made me start to think about getting help is my job. I managed to get my job back after having lost it because of Covid but only a week in I’m already really struggling to get through a 9 hour shift. The first half is fine, I feel great and productive enough to keep up with my other co workers. But about an hour in to the second half I fall apart. I start thinking that everyone is mad at me or hates me. Whenever a co worker speaks to a manager I think they’re talking about me. I start thinking that there is no way I can keep up with everyone else and about how they’re all miles better than I am at the job. At this point I usually start crying and I work in retail so I have to try and hide my face from the customers while still trying to tidy the shop and deal with all the other stuff I need to get done before close. The thing that really gets to me and makes me upset though is thinking about how they asked me to come back and work for them when other people I worked with before who were miles better than I am weren’t asked to come back. I feel incredibly guilty and like I’m letting them all down. I also fear my boss will fire me for doing such a shitty job because I find it hard tidying everything in a timely manner when my hands won’t stop shaking and I’m struggling to breathe because of my anxiety and my face mask. I get extremely overwhelmed and I haven’t had a panic attack at work yet but it’s scary because I constantly feel for the last few hours that I’m on the verge of having one.

My friend knows about this and she’s worried for me and wants me to get help but I know I’d be given meds because of how off the rails my anxiety is and I’m scared to take them. I really want to avoid gaining weight at all costs and I already only eat a very very limited selection of foods to avoid bloating (I have pretty severe ibs) because I don’t want to look fat. I’m only a U.S.A. size 2/UK size 6 but I’m an hourglass shape with poochy stomach, big bum, thick thighs, etc. So although I’m slim I definitely don’t have the ideal body and could never compete with girls who are straight up and down with a flat tummy. That could never be me because even my bones stick out way too much for that - my rib cage is large and my hip bones are really wide in comparison to my waist. The idea of looking even bigger or curvier than I am already makes me feel sick and panicky. I already have so much anxiety over the way my body looks and I worry that everyone thinks I’m fat because of my legs and hips and tummy. I also feel one of my friends already judges my weight because she always tries to pick out clothes for me that are about two sizes larger than what I actually am, and when I told her about a tank top having straps that were too large that they would fall off my shoulders she said I should try a size or two up. So I really don’t want to be looking any bigger than how I look already :((

Will anxiety medication really make me gain weight? If it does I don’t even want to bother going through the process of asking for help because the idea is incredibly scary and would make me feel vulnerable for the sake of nothing. Are there any particular meds to stay away from for this? And when it comes to medication would I be given it long term? Apparently long term is when you can gain a lot of weight and I really really don’t want that. I’m not kidding when I say I would immediately stop taking the meds if I noticed weight gain even if it was at the expense of my mental health. At that point I wouldn’t care how awful I felt mentally anymore just as long as I could prevent further weight gain. I just hope that I can find medication that makes me feel good again without ruining my body

,Anxiety,"First of all I need to say that this subreddit and the increased discussion/acceptance around mental health has been monumental in helping all of us understand this disease. More than that, the realization that the guilt society put on us for so long is ignorant and detrimental to our recovery and success. However, I think in the effort of consolation and support we may have overcorrected.

I (23M) was 19 when i started my battle with mental health, first with depression and soon after anxiety. Nowadays, anxiety is 90% of the battle so here I am. I realized in the first year after my official diagnosis how easy it could be to chock everything up to my A/D (anxiety/depression). In my first panic attack / major breakdown I quit my job, unleashed via on friends, and trashed my room. Toxic. I was incredibly afraid and lost all sense of reality. When I came to I contacted my boss and friend and let them know that Id had a panic attack and more or less blamed my actions on it. The next 6 months were the worst yet as i slipped deeper and deeper into my fears. I stopped socializing, failed my classes, burnt more bridges, and left myself even weaker and more alone. Through all of this I had been telling myself that I was so ill and so mentally weak from my A/D that I couldnt do anything to stop it. 

Finally, I saw a quote which read something like ""Your mental health is not your fault, but it is your responsibility."" It changed everything. I think in the massive online movement to make the discussion around mental health more supportive and open, we have created a culture that can blame any shortcoming on mental health. I dont want this to come across as hyper-critical. I know that support and love is the only gateway to breaking through this together. But sometimes that love needs to be a little tougher. 

Admittedly this responsibility is something that gets easier as I get older, and as Im sure theres a lot of you still young in this sub let me tell you: It Gets Sooooo Much Better. Dont Give Up. But start to pick up that responsibility now and lead yourself into the light. You are your own hero. You are incredible. No one knows you or how to help you better than you. But you cant do it alone.

Support is necessary in this battle, but even more so is finding the right support. Its a huge step for some of us and its the hardest, but working up the courage to tell your parents, your friends, your loved ones what you are going through will be the best thing you ever did. This subreddit is amazing, but shouldnt be your only support. We all need real, in person, human love and understanding. Be cautious of what social media will tell you about your anxiety. You are not a victim to your own mind, you are your own hero.

,Anxiety,"I have this intense anxiety about being wrong. It's not quite perfectionism, though it may be related to that. It's that if I tell someone something, believing it to be true, only for it to turn out to be false, I spiral into thinking the absolute worst possible thing will happen, like someone will die because of it, or it will ruin someone's life. I have tons of memories of being wrong, almost like the instant I'm wrong about something, it is stuck in my mind forever. 

I wonder if it is almost like OCD? But I am not sure if it is an obsession or compulsion exactly.....just this intense catastrophizing of basic errors, like telling someone a fun fact and finding out it was a myth, or giving someone the wrong directions, and I believe that something horrible will happen because of it. It is especially bad if I should have known it was untrue. 

I have similar anxiety about lying. If I lie, even if it was necessary, or a small lie, or if I didn't mean to lie, I feel disproportionately guilty. I do my best not to lie, but sometimes it is safer to lie about some things.

Even while I am writing this, I am proofreading it and editing it to make sure nothing I say here is false, doublechecking that I'm not misleading myself or remembering things wrong or exaggerating. Maybe that is a compulsion.

I know this is something I need to work on, though honestly I don't know where to start since as much as I try to convince myself someone won't die because of me accidentally giving false information, I physically believe it. Even if I temporarily relax and forget about it, it will bother me again in the future. 

I just need to know if there is a name for this kind of anxiety, or if anyone else experiences this, so I can start to figure out what to do (and hopefully feel a little more normal, if others experience this and I am not the only one).

Also, how do you stop latching onto memories? I have anxiety over using a word wrong on an essay years ago, lying about why I got a class jeopardy question wrong in fourth grade, accidentally lying about something in preschool when I truly did not know how to articulate what I meant. The memories should go away, right? But they don't--and the guilt weighs the same, whether it is ten days ago or ten years ago.

,Anxiety,"Im new here guys and i came specifically to help those out who sufder from anxiety and still keep masturbating to porn.
  

 Back in 9th grade i was masturbating like a madman and keep in mind i used to be a very confident, athletic and skilled guy, i was just very charismatic!


   I remember my first time releasing my semen and i just felt...empty like yeah i was relaxed and all but it was accompanied with an uncomfortable brain foggy/ empty feeling and it slowed me down alot. I slowly got worse at socializing in social circles and i got terrible at keeping a conversation flowing with females. 


 9th grade was also the year i got my first girlfirend and i thought i had it all until after 8 days, she broke up with me and i was devastated. She broke up with me because she ""wanted space"" which isnt a bad thing at all so after a couple minutes of convincing her to stay thru text i just let her be. A year later my good friend told me that she broke up with me because i was ""acting feminime"" that shattered me.


 She had straight up lied to me about the reason she broke up thinking i would get mad or something. But now when i think back to it, i was truly acting feminime and i Don't blame her nomore like i used to. I was constantly jacking off to porn on a weekly basis and constanlty lying around eating junk food just letting my life and grades slip away. Had this had been in 6th grade i would've lost my virginity to her.


Fast foward to a couple months back i was doing abstinence from beating ma meat and im not kidding i felt true confidence. I approached my crush of 4 years and received a hug from her when school began. Had that had been in 2017 or 18 i wouldve avoided eye contact with her let ALONE a hug.

,Anxiety,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here. I have struggled with anxiety since I was 11/12 years old. I have been on lots of different medications for anxiety including Klonapin, Paxil, Cymbalta, etc. I switched over to Zoloft last October and was also prescribed Hydroxzine to help with increased anxiety. I have 25mg pills and I take one in the morning and one at night and more throughout the day if I need it.

I've been having a lot of side effects from both medications but the side effect that's bothering me the most is fatigue. It's not exactly tired in the way that I'm sleepy and need to nap, it's like I have no stamina. It mostly happens when I stand up. I am so fatigued that I cannot stand up for very long without having to sit down.

I told my doctor about this and she said it's probably the Hydroxzine causing this. She told me to try and cut back on it if I could. I guess ideally I will not have to take the Hydroxyzine and will okay just on the Zoloft.

I was wondering if anyone else has taken Hydroxzine and had a side effect like this? I recently found out Hydroxzine is a an antihistamine like Benadryl which makes sense.

,Anxiety,"so about 2 years ago i started having really terrible panic attacks and anxiety that was interfering with my day to day life and making me miserable so i went to see a psychiatrist. I was prescribed lexapro and xanax and have been taking that ever since. Recently, I’ve been having an insane amount of trouble with school and life in general in regards to my difficulty focusing and concentrating. I’ve been seeing a lot of tik toks about adult women diagnosed with ADHD later in life and everything they were saying was exactly how I felt. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and told her about my symptoms including feeling exhausted all the time. She kept focusing on the tiredness and decided to lower my lexapro dosage thinking it was a side effect. I was really upset because I felt like she didn’t actually listen to what I was saying and focused on something that was annoying but not affecting me as much as the focus and concentration. 
After about a month of lowered Lexapro dosage and not feeling any increase in anxiety, I decided to have a fresh start and see a new psychiatrist. I told him about my history and my new symptoms that were affecting me greatly. He asked if i was impulsive (which I am since I have about 6 tattoos that were all walk ins lol) and if i have anger issues. I do get really irritable a lot where every sound annoys me and everything that people are doing around me annoys me and i’ll snap at people and then feel really bad after. I feel like it’s mostly a sensory overload thing where i just get really overwhelmed by everything around me. I don’t really think it’s an issue and I feel like everyone gets this way. 
After he asks all the questions he tells me i don’t have ADD and he wants me to 1. stop taking the lexapro , 2. stop drinking coffee and 3. start taking lamictal. After i got off the phone with him, i looked up the lamictal and found out it’s a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. so now i’m freaking out because apparently i have bipolar disorder and i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop taking the lexapro because i feel like it really helps my anxiety and i don’t know a lot about lamictal. but i’m also curious to see if the lamictal helps but i still feel like this isn’t going to do much for my difficulty in working. anyways i’m just looking for advice, encouragement, just anything to help me off the cliff lol",t2_3u27w4x7,False,,0,False,went to see a new psychiatrist for an ADD diagnosis...came out with a bipolar diagnosis instead???,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,adviceneeded,0,,,False,t3_n3xq8x,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620081516.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;so about 2 years ago i started having really terrible panic attacks and anxiety that was interfering with my day to day life and making me miserable so i went to see a psychiatrist.

,Anxiety,"Hi All, I just wanted to share my story over the last few months. This sub has been a great help, and I thought my story might be helpful to some of you.

In December my partner had an unusual health issue which triggered the worst bout of anxiety I've ever endured. Since then I've had a number of stressful work projects which exacerbated the situation. No acute panic attacks, but overthinking anything and everything all day long - permanent flight or flight mode. Over the last week I've finally started to feel a little better, and for the first time in months I'm confident that I'm on the road to recovery. I'm sure I still have some hard days ahead, but I know that the worst is behind me.

So in order of most to least effective, these are the things I feel have helped me.

_Acceptance and Commitment Therapy_

I'm really a novice at this, and there's a lot I don't understand, but the core concept is to stop resisting anxious thoughts. Suppose I'm worried about a difficult meeting. I might recognise that my thoughts about it are distorted and unhelpful, so the natural response is to simply try to avoid those thoughts. The thing is, the more effort you put into avoiding those thoughts the more forceful and painful they become. The key is to accept, acknowledge, and allow those anxious thoughts. This is really tricky, and requires a much deeper explanation than a reddit post, but I've found this to be super effective.

/r/acceptancecommitment is a little quiet. ""The Happiness Trap"" is a well recommended book (though I haven't read it). I read DARE by David McDonagh which I found to be a good introduction.

Just to be clear, discovering this concept was my big break. It really was the turning point.

_Cognitive Behaviour Therapy_

While we might realise that our thoughts are distorted, CBT really helps you unpack where those thoughts are coming from and find therapies to resolve them. In the example above, if I'm worried about a difficult meeting, I need to unpack exactly *why* I'm worried about it. In my case I discovered that I have ""Imposter Syndrome"" - I'm terrified of being exposed as a fraud, even though I have a wealth of skills and experience in my field. The solution for me was to ""survey"" some of my peers and coleagues by telling them about whatever screw ups, and note their response. Of course, universally they told me about one of their screw ups and when they did I realised that my judgement of them was dramatically more compassionate than my own self assessment.

Again, this is a really complex area that requires a lot more time and thought than I can give you in a reddit post.

/r/CBT is a good resource. ""When Panic Attacks"" by David Burns, and his other books, are often recommended in that sub. I found Burns books and podcasts to be immensely helpful.

_Decaf_

This one was a real surprise. I always thought that the anxiety associated with caffeine meant the jitters you get after your 6th cup for the day. It's not. I've learned that caffeine is responsible for that pervasive feeling of doom I got on a daily basis. I can assure you that this was a very unpleasant discovery. Coffee has been my special friend over many years, always there for me no matter what, it was quite a surprise to realise that it's been knifing me in the back every day.

/r/decaf is a great resource. I will say though, that sub is really fixated on quitting cold turkey, which IMO isn't the right move for most people.

Previously I was drinking 6 shots of regular coffee a day. I've reduced that to 2 shots of regular coffee and 4 shots of decaf. Decaf still has some caffeine so I've probably halved my intake. There's definitely benefits here but be warned - reducing your caffeine intake is harder than it sounds.

_Deep Breathing_

I used to think that ""deep breathing"" meant something like ""take 3 deep breaths when you feel anxious"", but I was wrong.

There's a lot of research suggesting that diaphragmatic breathing for a significant period of time, like 30 minutes a day, significantly reduces stress and anxiety. I'm certainly not an expert on this but apparently the science suggests that deep breathing can stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system to switch you out of permanent low-level fight or flight mode into rest &amp; rejuvenate mode. This reflects my experience.

Additionally, while you're sitting there deep breathing you can do some mindfulness stuff.

_Meds_

This is last on the list because, the medication has been helpful, but less so than the other things.

In the past I've taken a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs at different times, with breaks of up to a year in between.

This time round I decided on Mirtazapine (an atypical antidepressant) in order to avoid the side effects associated with an SSRI or SNRI.

It's hard to measure but I think the meds reduced my anxiety from 10/10 to maybe 6/10. It made the difference between being functional and non-functional, and I'm sure that it made it possible for me to invest the time and effort required in ACT or CBT.",t2_33mnskif,False,,0,False,My Journey - What Helped,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,progressflair,0,,,False,t3_n3spla,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Progress!,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620066199.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All, I just wanted to share my story over the last few months.

,Anxiety,"I've always liked the idea of streaming or uploading youtube videos where I just play games with a group of people. I play some LoL and Minecraft and I'd be happy to try others if I find a group to play with. I'm kind of hopeful since more content creators aren't using face cams, which would make me much more comfortable. I'm slowly trying to work myself up to it like recording short videos to send to my brother but it's pretty slow lol.

I hit a roadblock when I realized something I struggle with. I so badly want more friends and I do my best to talk to people and be open. But I caught myself thinking about how I don't want them to depend on me to come and hang out if I'm having a bad day (which I've had more of lately). Like some days it's difficult for me to talk a lot and that makes most people uncomfortable. I think I'd work best in a fairly big group of friends so I'm not under as much stress to carry a conversation. I also struggle with trusting that people will still like me once they get to know me or 'once they know how messed up I am'. I know this isn't a good way of thinking. I don't know how to get past it, though.

For anyone in the mcyt community, Wilbur Soot said that Tommy helped him a lot by asking him to get in a call and play. I don't have anyone like that and I'm really hoping I can find someone someday. None of my friends play games or ask to play. They just notice that I'm not okay and (from their past experience with me) leave me alone to get over it. I'm not good with emotions so they don't usually know how to help me. A lot of my growing process has had to happen through myself.

I've had a breakthrough recently, though! I asked one of my best friends to room with me in college, so I'm hoping that we'll get closer and I'll also be able to open up more. I've been hopping between a couple of therapists to work on talking about my feelings and trusting people. I think I've gotten a lot better. It's still kind of crushing though to not feel like I have any real friends. Even some of my newer friends at school ask me to come hang out a few times and when they see my reluctance (basically just fear of feeling bad or ruining the mood) they don't want to make me uncomfortable. They stop asking as much. I feel like I'm making a cycle that I can't get out of no matter how much I want to.

How do I find a group of friends? 

This feels so weird to ask. I usually end up being kind of adopted by people so I'm not the best at seeking new people on my own. Plus, them knowing in advance might help but I don't want that to be all they think of me. I have good days and bad but once people find out I have strong anxiety it's all they tend to see.

I asked one of my best friends to room with me in college, so I&amp;#39;m hoping that we&amp;#39;ll get closer and I&amp;#39;ll also be able to open up more. I&amp;#39;ve been hopping between a couple of therapists to work on talking about my feelings and trusting people. I think I&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot better. It&amp;#39;s still kind of crushing though to not feel like I have any real friends. Even some of my newer friends at school ask me to come hang out a few times and when they see my reluctance (basically just fear of feeling bad or ruining the mood) they don&amp;#39;t want to make me uncomfortable. They stop asking as much. I feel like I&amp;#39;m making a cycle that I can&amp;#39;t get out of no matter how much I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I find a group of friends? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels so weird to ask. I usually end up being kind of adopted by people so I&amp;#39;m not the best at seeking new people on my own. Plus, them knowing in advance might help but I don&amp;#39;t want that to be all they think of me. I have good days and bad but once people find out I have strong anxiety it&amp;#39;s all they tend to see. This is rambly, sorry&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"A few months ago, I finally decided to go on a mental health plan. The doctor was super sweet. She started me on lexapro and gave me a referral for a psychiatrist. I was really excited. Well I stayed on the lexapro for about 3 weeks and then my shiftwork kept fucking with my schedule so much (on and off nightshifts) and I forgot when I had and hadn't taken it because I suffer from a lot of short term memory loss. And eventually I gave up because I thought it was useless to keep trying. I hadn't even used the referral for therapy because I was so nervous about having to call around clinics as many are booked out for months these days and I was too exhausted from work to bother, anyway.

I switched jobs to something less physically and mentally taxing which at first I thought was helping. I'm on a proper schedule now, too. But my anxiety is just manifesting in different ways. My paranoia has gotten so much worse. I keep second guessing myself and my own intentions, and I feel like my only close friends are plotting against me all the time.

,Anxiety,"I have intense health anxiety, ever since I was a kid, mostly regarding my heart health. I think it's because it's the most prominent symptom of my panic attacks, with palpitations and racing beats. I have been assured that it's normal. 

I've been having some intense anxiety over the past couple of weeks. I got a new job, which I do like but I took a pay cut to get my foot in the door of a major hospital and get out of the toxic situation at my old workplace, which paid me more but it wasn't worth it. Because of said pay cut, it's been harder for me to have enough money to make any sort of significant dent ent in my credit card debt, even following the Ramsey model. 

I'm struggling with being able to focus and finish my online medical coding course, which has a deadline to finish by the end of June or I need to pay for an extension. I'm trying really hard to finish soon because this job pays a LOT when I'm certified.

On top of this, there's a MAJOR battle with my new insurance company over one of my medications that I use to treat a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy, but rarer. The med is $17k cash price a *month*, and my new insurance took its sweet time only to deny it two weeks later being like ummm you haven't seen your doctor in over a year, go see him and MAYBE we'll reconsider. Like my diagnosis hasn't changed, assholes, but thanks. So the thought of my med still being denied after I see my doctor freaks me out, because I cannot function without it at *all*. 

So of course now with my heart rate being as high as it has been, and now working in a position where I am regularly reviewing medical records of patients where it is rather detailed with their issues regarding high blood pressure and tachycardia, I'm getting more freaked out. I'm only 27 and the thought of potentially having to take blood pressure meds freaks me out even more. 

Ironically though I did just take a propranolol about 20 minutes ago and I'm waiting for it to kick in, so my body can calm tf down. God I hate this. Situational anxiety is so hard to treat.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 29. I take care of myself. From an outsiders perspective I&amp;#39;m not in a horrible spot in life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I recently got into a little habit where when things get overwhelming I’d go over to a solo chat that I have on WhatsApp to vent and attempt to clear my mind. The following text occurred when I responded to a friend’s concerning status message and I regretted it. I don’t know why but I felt like sharing this might be helpful or something? Idk. I found it interesting to have my thought process in text so I decided to share it. Not sure if I flaired it right but I guess it fits 🤷🏽‍♀️ 




I hate this I hate this I hate this!!! I can’t do it! C*** needs some reassurance right now but I can’t give it to her! I can’t understand what I should do. I don’t know what she’s feeling. I failed courses too but I don’t even react to it, it’s just meh for me! I touched the glass, my precious snow globe, I put another crack in it! It’s going to break, I’m such a horrible friend. Am I even a friend? I feel a hurricane of emotions deep down inside me but I’m not feeling anything on the first few layers. I’m just blank faced and I can’t think. I can’t do this! Why do I have friends? Is she still even my friend?! I just went and deleted the conversation just for me but obviously she’d still have it and she’d have the record of a friend who can’t comfort. Why can’t I comfort? Where the hell is my comfort gland or whatever? I can’t give love, I can’t give support! Where did the Advisor in me go? I was always the one that gave advice and was able to understand people but now I can’t. Please please please come back, I want to help. But I can’t. I can’t I can’t! This is why I avoid talking to people, destroy any relationship I touch. 




I’m freaking adding fuel to the fire, what am I saying?! Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.




I must archive. I need to delete myself asap.




That’s it. I did it. She went to ‘sleep’. Did she actually go to sleep? What if she just wanted to escape from the hella dry conversation? I can’t take this. She probably disowned me. Does she even consider me a friend? I’m done man. I’m done.




This happened over the course of an hour. The snow globe is a reference to a poem I wrote that described my friendships as fragile pieces of glass that I kept on a shelf. If I messed with it it would be destroyed. Some glasses had more cracks than others.
